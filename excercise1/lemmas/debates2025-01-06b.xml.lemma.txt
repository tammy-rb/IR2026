that more need to be spend on defence to meet the increase threat he ask why only two out of of the major defence project be on time and on budget that question may well be direct at the shadow defence secretary the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge who be responsible for exactly that up until the election six month ago there be of course question about how much we spend but there be also challenge in how well we spend it the shadow armed forces minister the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois be one of the strong critic of the previous government and of what

care and equipment on service personnel mental and physical health what will instal an armed force commissioner do to make their standard of live well thank my hon friend for his service it be absolutely vital that the voice of armed force personnel and their family be listen to more that be why we be establish in the commissioner an independent champion for armed force and their family the commissioner will have an independent role be able to scrutinise the action of the armed force and report to parliament rather than to ministers and will not be beholden to the whim of either any government of the day or the chain of command that independence will allow the commissioner to scrutinise general service welfare matter shin spotlight on the issue that really matter to those who serve in uniform and their family the government have say that part of their inspiration for the armed forces commissioner be such role in germany yet germany have parliamentary armed force commissioner why be there that difference and why in line with what the minister say in an early answer can we trust the independence of this new appointment the right hon gentleman be right that the german armed force commissioner be part of the inspiration for the role dr eva högl be superb example of how we can scrutinise and champion the armed force and provide solution and voice to those who serve she sit effectively as member of parliament in the german parliament which we do not feel be appropriate for the uk armed forces commissioner but the independence and the way she have pioneer much of that work in recent year be real inspiration to we we hope that such workable example from key nato ally people can raise issue with she and shine spotlight on those issue to improve service welfare matter and as result improve morale and the operational effectiveness of the armed force will give strength to the independence of the role call the shadow minister during debate on the bill in committee raise the worrying issue that under the treasury propose inheritance tax change service personnel who be unmarried but in long term relationship could have their partner service benefit tax should they die while in service the forces pension society have rightly highlight that that would be totally contrary to the spirit of the armed force covenant have the minister yet raise this with the treasury as we strongly suggest last month he should and if so what progress have be make as the right hon gentleman will recall from the bill committee which in parliamentary sitting day be only few day ago we be raise issue around number of thing include the one he raise it be subject to consultation as he know so decision have not be make it be responsibility for the treasury rather than the ministry of defence but undertake to write to he and will do so housing military personnel and family what step he be take to improve housing for military personnel and their family what progress he have make on improve military accommodation what step he be take to improve housing for military personnel and their family thank my hon friend for raise an exceptionally important matter the deal to sell off most of our service family accommodation in then rent it back and upgrade it be probably one of the bad deal can think of the recent annington home deal support by those on both side of the house be deliver at speed by this government and it save this country and the taxpayer day or million year it put we back in the drive seat of own all our family accommodation it allow we to renovate or rebuild as require over the next five to year and long into the future in the medium to long term we have once in generation lifetime opportunity to rebuild all our accommodation may wish happy new year to you mr speaker to member and to constituent in north somerset morale in our military hit record low under the last government and be proud that this government have already deliver the large pay rise for the force in more than year do the minister agree that this housing deal be the next practical step in the action that this government be deliver to improve service life for dedicated personnel my hon friend make an important point have live in some of the accommodation and have see how bad it be and this deal will allow we to change that over time we will have chance save million year to give the people who serve this country the deal they deserve when it come to housing during my service in the late through the and into the early have the pleasure of have to live in military accommodation its poor condition be discuss almost weekly roll forward year and we be still have the same discussion can minister please assure that they will now seriously get grip of that and through the strategic defence review give some clear programme delivery date for when we will deliver for our force absolutely as part of the sdr we will set out our new defence housing strategy we will look at how we take annington build on it and improve the housing available for those who serve in our armed force as member of force family welcome the government landmark decision to renationalise service housing for too long military family have be live in substandard accommodation how will the minister ensure that this investment lead to tangible improvement in what timescale can our servicemen and servicewoman expect to see those improvement start we be buy back we be break it down and we will build back up that will be part of comprehensive plan across the country and across home over time it will look to deliver housing that be fit for those who serve and the family member who be often leave behind when those individual deploy have absolute confidence that we will deliver that in conjunction with independent body as well as those in defence the minister have already refer to his successful billion deal to repurchase the mod housing estate from annington it will give member of our armed force the opportunity to have their home refurbish which they have long for for very long time have he manage to persuade the treasury that he will need to provide further fund to pump prime these improvement if so how will he strengthen the hitherto very poor management of our military housing estate as part of our new defence housing strategy we will look at how we will manage that estate as whole and whether we will do it completely differently as part of the sdr we will look at how we will pump prime some of that to get build back across the whole defence estate bear in mind that there be house and some of they have be in situ for about year and will need to be knock down and rebuild under the previous arrangement between the ministry of defence and annington million be release for accommodation upgrade in the first seven year of that arrangement what due diligence be carry out ahead of the sale what additional investment will be make in the married quarter that the government have bring back into the mod ownership this be one of the good deal that defence have do in long time it have buy back home save the taxpayer day or million over year we be in discussion with the treasury now about where that money go and how it will be use in the future but assure the hon member that the rebuild plan will be within the defence housing strategy as part of the sdr since october more than afghans eligible for support via the afghan relocation and assistance policy have be move into ministry of defence service family accommodation both transitional and then settle service family accommodation under operation lazurite how many sfa house in the defence estate be currently be use to house afghan family what be the plan for their onward movement once their three year eligibility for settle service family accommodation have elapse thank the hon member for that really important question we have duty of care to those from afghanistan who be now live in the uk and we be absolutely committed to deliver on that will write to he in due course on the specific of his question call the liberal democrat spokesperson in there be over report of damp and mould in service accommodation member of the armed force be willing to put their life on the line to support the freedom that we take for grant so it be inconceivable that they and their family be force to live in home fill with damp and mould now that the mod have agree to buy back thousand of these family home will the government commit to ensure that all service family accommodation meet the minimum standard for social housing as set out in the decent home standard we already do that the reality be that large proportion of these house be build to year ago so the thick insulation and double skinned wall that we would see as commonplace just do not exist the annington deal be therefore such good one as it allow we to refurbish or rebuild as require ukraine military support what recent discussion he have have with his us counterpart on military support for ukraine the labour government be deliver for defence by step up and speed up support for ukraine in december we announce an additional package of artillery air defence and drone the defence secretary hold regular discussion with his us counterpart on how good to support ukraine most recently on

cultural and community tie in talk with the incoming us government will the minister ensure that they be aware of the endure and deep solidarity that the british people feel towards the people of ukraine in their effort to defeat brutal aggressor thank the hon member my fellow south west mp for her advocacy of that as well as the people of bath who have open their home to so many ukrainian family as have family right across the country it be vital that we continue to support not only ukraine to stay in the fight to protect its sovereignty and freedom but those ukrainians in the united kingdom and in ukraine to ensure that they can go about normal life as much as possible the government support that work and will continue support ukraine for as long as it take the secretary of state and the minister have put britain military production capability at the heart of the government support for ukraine wonder what opportunitie the minister spy for transatlantic co operation in that regard may make special plea that the whole defence team discuss plan for develop our industrial capacity with regional mayor so that job and factory can be set up and develop around the country include in region like my own it be vital that we continue to support ukraine and build our industrial capacity in the united kingdom and across the nato alliance to ensure that ukraine can fight not only tonight but tomorrow part of that be about increase the industrial supply of not just uk manufacturer but indigenous manufacturer within ukraine itself build that great industrial capacity be something that the government take seriously that be why the secretary of state and the minister for defence procurement and industry have publish the outline of the defence industrial strategy we will continue to work with partner at both national and international level and additionally at regional and local level to ensure that we have the industrial capacity and skill require to restock our own supply and continue to support ukraine defence industrial strategy sme what step he plan to take through the defence industrial strategy to increase support for defence sector sme we be deliver

security however the majority of those job be outside london and the south east therefore growth and crucially engagement with defence and security be inhibit for young people in constituency such as mine will the minister confirm that the key ambition of our defence industrial strategy will be to broaden access to the defence sector in every region include constituency such as mine be happy to accept that point and agree plenty of job and skill will be need around the country in every nation and region so that we improve matter everywhere christmas come early for the uk defence industry

know when his birthday be but present some time later call the shadow minister on defence industrial strategy the new amphibious multi role support ship be several year away point the armed forces minister obviously appreciate when in opposition last january he write to his local paper to say that scrap hms albion and bulwark would be bad for our national security for the royal navy and for devonport when the defence committee look at this issue few year ago it firmly conclude that the decision would be militarily illiterate yet today the ministry of defence be all for it even if the minister for defence procurement and industry do not agree with the defence committee do she at least agree with the armed forces minister that these vital ship should be retain neither of the ship have be at sea for year one since and the other since and neither be due to go back out to sea before their out of service date the question of who might be say to have scrap they be moot the ship have not be scrap but we take the tough decision in november to retire age capability so that we can save the money for deal with the threat that we will face in future veteran housing what step his department be take to ensure that veteran have access to appropriate housing the prime minister have make it clear that ensure that veteran and their family can access support include for housing be priority he mention that in his speech at party conference he have also announce that veteran will be exempt from the local connection test for social housing in england and commit an additional million to continue the reduce veteran homelessness programme include op fortitude the transition from military to civilian life be critical moment for many veteran but too often those with complex mental health issue fall through the crack especially when it come to access housing the armed force covenant be an excellent positive step forward but its voluntary nature mean that not all veteran will benefit equally will the minister commit to review the transition process and particularly mental health service provision to ensure that all veteran receive more comprehensive and tailor support the career transition pathway that have just be set up be great example of how we be help those leave the service to transition into civilian life op courage in particular have have more than referral

and constituency and across the country with adult in the constituency on the minimum wage will the minister help to work with the department for education to ensure that kid in my city get

ukrainians have the equipment and ammunition they need to stay in the fight as well as deepen our defence relationship with they we be take that across the nato alliance to all nato member and we will continue to stand with ukraine for as long as it take may commend the government on their recent decision to bring large amount of military housing back in house after the disastrous tory decision to

work of the british army in operation stifftail which use our sky sabre system to help to defend polish airspace there will be further such joint deployment of our armed force in due course it sound like the government be not very keen to talk about diego garcia with president trump but when people as diverse as president trump and lord neil kinnock agree that nato country should be spend between and on defence would it not be sensible to take they seriously on diego garcia members will have the chance to scrutinise the detail of any treaty once it come before the house just as the previous government do we make sure throughout the negotiation that the us administration be fully inform fully brief and fully content with the step that we be take the procurement of ajax waste hundred of

recent tweet from people associate with the incoming us administration what assessment have the secretary of state make of the uk exposure of our defence capability give that there may be some change in the white house the us be the close ally of this country and this country be the close security ally of the us that have be for case the decade it have withstand the up and down of the political cycle on both side of the atlantic and we as government will work closely with the incoming us administration defence spend with northern ireland small and medium sized enterprise last year account for only million what will the secretary of state and the minister do to proactively increase that spend with northern ireland sme the hon gentleman make an important point hope that our defence industrial strategy in enable sme to access contract and work for the mod more easily will increase that number substantially will the minister agree to meet to discuss the figure for the incidence of blood cancer and sarcoma in veteran and current service personnel who have crew particular military helicopter give the concern around exposure to exhaust fume and the importance that we place on

reform we now come to the first statement be sure there must be something leave to say happy new year to you mr speaker and to everyone across the house with your permission will give an update on health and adult social care reform start by pay tribute to the nhs and social care staff who work throughout the christmas break include by staff our hospital ambulance service care home and call centre on christmas day and throughout the new year from visit hospital and residential care home in the south west of england essex london south yorkshire and the north west over the past two week know the extent of the pressure they be deal with they be go above and beyond to keep the nhs standing to provide people with the social care they need and to give patient and care user the good care they possibly can against the most challenging backdrop we have see more than three time as many patient hospitalise with flu this winter compare with last year in service with no slack leave to give since come into office the government have be do everything we can to prepare the nhs for winter include by end the resident doctor strike this be the first winter in three year when staff be on the frontline not the picket line the chancellor make an additional billion available in year to fill the black hole leave by the previous government and we introduce the new respiratory syncytial virus vaccine to protect more than million people against the virus but be not go to pretend for second that the experience of patient this winter be acceptable the government have be honest about the state of the nhs since the election and we will continue to be the nhs be break but not beat it will take time to fix but it can be do that be why the chancellor make an additional billion available in year to fill the black hole leave by the previous government and to enable we to deliver on our first step to cut nhs waiting time that be why we be undertake fundamental reform and it be why we be act on social care these be the honest fact the social care system in this country be fail leave hundred of thousand of disabled and elderly people without the care they need the failure of social care be pile enormous pressure on the nhs in november more than hospital patient day be well enough to leave but have to stay overnight because they be not able to be discharge we have an age society by there will be million more people age and over in england if we do nothing social care cost be expect to double over two decade of course there be plenty of blame to go around in when andy burnham establish cross party talk on social care the conservatives pull out and leak detail of the talk to attack labour in it be labour who torpedo theresa may proposal and in the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak as chancellor delay boris johnson cap on care cost and then defunde they as prime minister there have not be shortage of good idea in the past year but lack of good politic it be time all of we across the house do thing differently have write to my opposite number and the leader of all uk wide party represent in the house to invite they to help break out of the cycle of political failure hope all of we across the house will put aside our ideological and partisan difference and work together on this to finally find way through to long term plan that can build the broad consensus we need we do not need to agree on everything but in april we will launch an independent commission on build national care service be delighted that it will be head by one of our country lead social reformer and whitehall great doer baroness louise casey baroness casey have serve labour conservative and liberal democrat governments she be trust independent figure who will take view from all party and crucially the public as she seek to build cross party and national consensus on the future of social care she will get thing do her first report will be publish next year make series of recommendation that can be implement straight away throughout this parliament and her final report will come later in this parliament in the meantime we be stabilise the social care system today we have legislate for the first ever fair pay agreement for social care to tackle the workforce crisis the vacancy we see today in the budget the chancellor provide the big increase in carer allowance since the worth year to family carer and an extra billion for local authority on friday visit the home of keith and elaine in carlisle see at first hand how extended doorway and the installation of accessible kitchen and bathroom facility have change their life thank to the disabled facility grant allow they to live with renew dignity independence and happiness that be why announce last week the immediate release of million through the disabled facility grant to provide an extra home adaptation before april change the life of thousand more disabled people for the well just as keith and elaine have experience we be not hang around on reform either we be introduce new standard to help people who use care their family and provider to choose the most effective new technology as it come on the market we be join up care and medical record so nhs and care staff have the full picture they need to provide the good possible care and we be train care worker to perform more health intervention to help people stay well and at home lot do huge amount more to do and if this house get this right the good be yet to come turn to the elective reform plan the prime minister have launch today the government inherit nhs waiting list at million the nhs standard that patient should wait no long than week for treatment have not be meet for decade million of patient be force to put their life on hold while they wait in his investigation lord darzi list the cause of this crisis the undoing of new labour reform the disastrous top down reorganisation and slash gps and community health service all of which have lead to dramatic drop in hospital productivity lord darzi have diagnose the condition now this labour government be prescribe the cure in november the prime minister set out the government plan for change plan to dig this country out of the hole it be leave in and an act of resistance against the status quo of manage decline it commit to cut maximum waiting time from month today to week by the end of this parliament today we be set out how we will hit that ambitious target so that once again the nhs be there for we when we need it this will demand fast improvement than even the last labour government achieve that mean do thing differently it have to be plan for investment and reform investment and reform be what labour promise before the election investment and reform be what we be deliver our elective reform plan will cut waste and inefficiency ramp up the number of appointment scan and operation that the nhs perform and give nhs patient great choice control and convenience any patient use the nhs can see the waste and inefficiency in the service when they use it staff feel it hold they back every day when the government announce significant investment in the budget say that it would come with reform so that every pound be well spend and here it be resource will be divert from hospital to gps to get hundred of thousand more patient care for fast in the community patient will have the choice of whether they want or need follow up appointment save million pointless appointment year gps will be able to directly refer patient for test and scan cut out the middle man and speed up diagnosis for patient across wide range of condition for year restaurant have be texte customer reminder of their booking give they the chance to cancel or rearrange to cut down on no show the nhs will learn from the hospitality sector do the same for patient and cut around million miss appointment every year as result in opposition we say that investment in new and more productive way of working would make significant dent in waiting time today we be announce new and expand surgical hub to run like formula pitstop and bust through the backlog community diagnostic centre will open at evening and weekend so that patient do not have to take time off work for their appointment and can get diagnose fast we be reward trust that cut waiting time fast with extra capital investment as an incentive and we be publish new agreement with the independent sector the first of its kind for year to cut waiting time over the past year two tier healthcare system emerge in this country people who can afford it be increasingly go private to skip the queue while those who can not are leave behind work people be go into debt and other be run fundraiser to pay to get an operation those story belong in pre war britain they should shame the conservative party be determined to end two tier healthcare in this country so that whether you be the rich or poor person in britain you get timely quality treatment free at the point of use this new agreement will see more nhs patient able to choose to be treat in private hospital where there be capacity pay for by the state more capacity will be available for people in working class area of the country and for woman stick on gynaecology waiting list where we can treat work people fast we will and we make no apology for do so working class patient in this country deserve the same choice control and convenience as the wealthy expect indeed as we all expect from other app and service that we use every day but not the nhs that be why we be also modernise the nhs app to put patient in the drive seat for their own care if customer can choose when their deliveroo meal will arrive and be keep inform until it be drop off why should patient not be afford the same service by the nhs with this plan they will be patient will be able to manage their appointment book test and scan view result as soon as they be ready and choose where they will be treat we will cut down on letter that arrive in the post after an appointment and give power back to the patient in the past six month we have end the resident doctor strike and invest billion more in our health service with the big investment in hospice and end of life care for generation we be deliver investment and reform in general practice to fix the front door to the nhs and bring back the family doctor and we have start to get nhs waiting list fall this plan for investment and reform will press down hard on the accelerator and will change our nhs and the experience of million of patient it will put the nhs on the road to recovery and commend this statement to the house be grateful to the secretary of state for his typical courtesy in early sight of his statement as well for his call last week indeed it be early sight than be use to because be able to read most of it in the medium before come here which be not unhelpful echo the secretary of state comment in thank and pay tribute to nhs and social care staff up and down the country include those in my university hospital of leicester nhs trust gps and indeed all those in chorley hospital mr speaker for all they have do over the festive period they work full on day in day out every day of the year but they particularly feel the pressure over the festive period when they be not able to spend it with their family so it be important that we across the chamber share our recognition of that the secretary of state set out clearly the challenge face the system we all know that clinical care the nhs and social care must work well and as whole for our health and care system to function so it be right that his statement address both those issue he also highlight the challenge we face as an age society we be all live long which be good thing but that bring challenge of care and more complex need of course that come on top of the ongoing challenge of the legacy of the pandemic which be still with we in many way in his comment the secretary of state refer to previous reform he opt not to reflect another point in lord darzi report his positive remark about our reform which the secretary of state know take through this house and which lay the foundation on which he be now able to build give the serious and cross party work we have do certainly on social care highlight that the challenge be real and we must address both challenge swiftly before turn to the long term turn to the immediate and ask the secretary of state few question about winter and the challenge the nhs be face we hear from the minister before christmas about the work be do for extra co ordination and new datum but what extra capacity in bed specifically for the winter period have the secretary of state put in place to help ease pressure what additional capacity have he put into we always recognise that winter be challenging and we always put in extra resource support and capacity so would be grateful for an update would be grateful for an update from the secretary of state on the pressure be feel in respect of the quad demic of various challenge face by the sector also how many critical incident have trust declare since december would be grateful if he could update we on the pressure be feel and the response to they in the light of the winter weather in my melton and syston constituency in leicestershire and in many constituency across the country we have see extensive flooding which have have an impact on our ambulance service in particular turn to reform and elective recovery want to support the secretary of state where he be do the right thing and it be important that he be keen to pursue bold and innovative agenda it be in all our interest that he be bold but call for he to be more ambitious those be not word often speak about he and suspect certainly not in no but call for he to be bold and to go far that be because as with so much from the prime minister with multiple relaunche of previous announcement what we see here be yet another relaunch of previous announcement the difference be the former secretary of state sir sajid javid announcement from have be reheat and re serve up today we deliver community diagnostic centre with million additional appointment and we deliver surgical hub how will the secretary of state plan go beyond that we work with the independent sector to allow it to be use to help tackle backlog we improve technology and the kit available with billion of investment the nhs app create during the pandemic be design and redesign by my right hon friend the member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay and his team to allow for regular update again it be right that the secretary of state be update the app but how be he radically change what be already in place certainly already receive text update as suspect do other on treatment and appointment so my challenge to the secretary of state be this what be he do that be fundamentally different the key underpinning point in the former secretary of state plan be on workforce because none of this can be deliver without the staff to deliver and interpret test he set out his plan to grow the workforce and we have record number of doctor and nurse and increase medical school place what be this secretary of state plan to grow the workforce and deliver on his ambition turn to social care the secretary of state will know because have say it publicly that will work constructively with he and the commission he be right to highlight the challenge that government of all complexion have face include royal commission two green papers and comprehensive spending review that do not deliver under tony blair and gordon brown similarly theresa may reform do not deliver we propose reform that be due to come in this year but the chancellor scrap they think it be important that we look to the future and at how we can work constructively on social care say to the secretary of state that we will enter into discussion with he and the commission in that spirit but challenge he on the pace of his ambition the sector be already under pressure and that have be add to by the national insurance increase which it do not yet know how it will pay the real challenge for he be why the sector be cry out for fast pace be bold be more ambitious and we will work with he to deliver it it take year plus to deliver diagnosis we know the challenge he have have year in opposition he should have plan now we will call out the secretary of state when he get it wrong or simply re announce what be already happen but he be right in his approach to social care and find way forward and we will work constructively for the good of patient and all our constituent many of they already feel let down by promise break by the labour party over just the past six month so ask he not to break this promise and to work with we across the house to deliver the change that our constituent deserve and expect we to work on together to deliver it seem to be the conservative line across the board now to say you ve have year in opposition so why have you sort it all out in six month say gently that the conservatives have year in government and it will take long than six month to clean up their mess honestly their contribution to discussion in this house might have more credibility and strong landing zone if they at least acknowledge their part in the deep mess and malaise that they have create over the past year none the less on social care very sincerely and warmly welcome the conservative party support for the independent commission it be important as matter of principle to try to establish in broad term the level of consensus about what social care should look like and how it should be deliver to meet the need of old and disabled people in the century with change demography change challenge change pressure and change pace of technology and about the balance of provision between the individual the family and the state and the balance of financial contribution for social care between the individual the family and the state of course those issue will inevitably be contest across the party political divide from one election to the next but just as we have have broad consensus on the national health service since just as we have have broad consensus on state education since rab butler reform and just as we have mostly have broad consensus for much of the past century on how public service should be deliver so too should we try to establish the same consensus on social care that be not to say that we should agree on everything but we should agree on as much as possible because whether it be gordon brown and andy burnham in or theresa may in we can see the extent to which party political wrangling rancour and sometimes opportunism have sink well mean attempt to grasp the nettle of reform on the question of pace reassure people that in our first six month we have already legislate for fair pay agreement deliver the big expansion of carer allowance since the and immediately inject million into the disabled facility grant with another million to follow from million in total over the next year as well as the increase spending power for local government in the budget and million for social care specifically with respect to the people who be say go fast urge they to bear in mind that we have already do quite lot in six month we do not pretend that we have solve all the problem we have not nearly solve all the problem but that be not bad start for government who be determined to show that we understand the pressure in social care today and be willing to deliver the dilnot proposal be very good technical response to question that andrew dilnot be set by david cameron but we should reflect on why it be that every single prime minister since lord cameron include lord cameron himself do not implement those reform there have always be something else in health and social care that have be more pressing and urgent be sure that baroness casey will consider the dilnot proposal alongside all the other challenge and potential solution to the wide issue in social care but we be determined to respond at pace that be why the first phase of the casey commission will report next year set out an action plan throughout this parliament hope that we can achieve broad consensus on those action too turn to the winter situation the right hon gentleman have ask what capacity there be accord to the late figure there be more acute bed this year than last year of course those figure flex up and down depend on pressure but the pressure be enormous the number of bed occupy by flu patient be much high than this time last year somewhere between three and four time high the number of adult bed close due to noroviru have reduce in the late figure but it be still above last year when bed be close the late figure be on ambulance response we have see many more call out this year there have be increase in emergency admission compare with the same period last year with the high november on record for attendance ambulance response time be nowhere near where we would want they to be because of the enormity of the pressure which be why have be out on the frontline include over the christmas period we be not just look at what we can do to mitigate challenge this year we be already begin to plan for next year because want to see year on year continuous improvement in urgent and emergency care now turn to the challenge on the reform plan we have propose and set out today start with the workforce one of the reason we have emphasise the importance of not just investment but reform be the need to free up the staff capacity that we already have in the nhs to good effect that mean deal with the number of non attendance by send reminder to patient and give they ease and convenience in rebooke it be why we be get rid of unnecessary low clinical value out patient appointment with the consent of patient in every case it be why we be ask general practitioner to do more to manage case in the community with more advice and guidance and fund they to do so work with colleague in secondary care to ease pressure on hospital today reform plan answer the challenge we have hear from people across the nhs how do we tackle the elective backlog without do so at the expense of general practice urgent and emergency care community care or social care the truth be that this be systemic challenge and we will only be able to deal with the challenge in the elective backlog by also act on urgent and emergency care general practice community care and delay discharge in social care we be take system wide approach to meet this essential target number of thing be different from under the previous government for example on the deal with those in the independent sector give they the stability and certainty of work with this government give they the confidence to open and invest in new capital estate and new kit particularly in part of the country that be relatively underserved by the independent sector we have insist they do that with their own staff and resource and that they put their money where their mouth be in relation to train new staff to deal with some of those pressure that be how we will ensure that we will not be take peter from the nhs hospital to treat paul up the road at the independent hospital finally be happy to take more question on the detail of the plan the shadow secretary of state ask what be different from in fact think he ask to commend my predecessor sir sajid javid for his work in in the bipartisan spirit of the new year let commend the work that he and sir sajid javid do in try to undo lord lansley disastrous top down reorganisation and that be very good thing to do there will be very big difference between this government and our conservative predecessor real delivery shorter waiting time and an nhs fit for the future do the secretary of state agree that his plan to transform adult social care service have already start with labour employment rights bill ensure that social care worker will get fair national pay and condition and increase access to training and progression do he far agree that we will never have quality social care service in this country if we do not value the people deliver it properly as this labour government intend to do my hon friend be absolutely rightly the employment rights bill introduce in our first day contain provision for new fair pay agreement for care worker and who well to be lead the charge on that than the care worker turn deputy prime minister my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner call the liberal democrats spokesperson add my thank to those of the secretary of state and the shadow secretary of state to all those who work in our health and care service over christmas and the new year our health and social care system be in crisis so the liberal democrats be broadly supportive of the measure that the government have announce today however we do have some concern not least that action on social care may arrive too late and that the focus on elective care may come at the expense of emergency care the liberal democrats have long call for cross party talk on social care so we be glad that the government have listen and we look forward to work constructively with the secretary of state and other uk wide party as the review develop however carer care provider and council be on the brink of bankruptcy and they need solution right now not in three year time there have be many such review and what be need now be action on the recommendation they have make it be absolutely crucial that wait time for elective care be cut radically so the action announce today to speed up scan and treatment be very positive waiting list of more than million people be one of the bad legacy leave by the conservatives but those legacy include overcrowded and unacceptable ambulance delay which can mean the difference between life and death as people in north shropshire know only too well emergency care be under immense pressure at the moment one visit to shrewsbury hospital demonstrate that and we need bold action if we be to ensure that this be the last ever winter crisis as the mp for rural area hear every week from constituent suffer because of the crisis so they will be follow today development closely many of my constituent be elderly far more than average and they be the people most likely to need the nhs and the most likely to be digitally exclude accord to age uk around of people age and over do not use the internet and around third do not have smartphone they deserve as much choice and control as everybody else so can the secretary of state outline how those without access to the nhs app will be able to benefit from the same option and information as those who do have access will the secretary of state consider fast track the social care review so that the sector can get the urgent attention it need will he commit to rescue our emergency service by support liberal democrat call to make the nhs winter proof with new winter taskforce that build resilience in hospital ward department and patient discharge finally will he define what work class area be because the health and care crisis be acute in rural britain and we can not afford to be leave behind thank the liberal democrats for their support for the commission and for the way in which their party have put the issue of social care much higher up the political agenda particularly during the general election campaign that have be very helpful to in the last six month and to the government and we look forward to work with the liberal democrats to build as broad consensus as we can on the solution to the social care crisis as have mention we have hit the ground run in number of respect include the big expansion of carer allowance since the on investment in health and social care just point out that the billion the chancellor allocate to the department of health and social care alone at the budget dwarf what the liberal democrats promise in their manifesto know that not all the funding decision the chancellor and the government have make in the last six month for the desperately need investment in our public service have be popular but respectfully say to people who disagree with the decision the chancellor have make that they need to spell out which service they would cut or which other taxis they would increase because those be the choice we have make our choice we stand by they what people can not do be welcome the investment but not say how they would fund it if they oppose what we have do the prime minister the chancellor and the entire government have be willing to make unpopular choice in the last six month because we believe they be the right choice to get britain out of the hole it be leave in by our predecessor people will not thank we for resort to the short termist stick plaster government by gimmick politic that plague this house during the last parliament turn to some of the other issue that the hon lady mention we will make further proposal on urgent and emergency care reform want to take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs whether it be hear and treat over the phone triage more appropriate community response that be often fast than ambulance response time or get ambulance and ambulance handover speed up at all our hospital with the release to respond approach we have see that work successfully in some part of the country but it need to be consistently roll out the hon lady talk about patient choice for those who be digitally disconnected or do not want to organise their life around their smartphone that be why believe very strongly in choice different course for different horse those of we who do not book appointment over the phone free up the line so that those who prefer do their business and book appointment by phone can get through the hon lady ask we to fast track the social care work the first phase of louise casey commission will report next year but we be of course willing to talk to party across the house about how we move forward the hon lady urge we to set up an urgent and emergency care taskforce let reassure she that the minister of state for health my hon friend the member for bristol south karin smyth and have every week and often more frequently convene health and care leader virtually and in the department to keep grip on what be go on to provide as much central support as possible and to respond to crisis as they emerge if only that be just about set up taskforce we already have one what we need be sustained improvement from one year to the next and that be what we be determined to deliver rise may suggest that we help each other by ask short question with short punchy answer be sure ben coleman will set good example mr speaker take that personally in positive way this be very encouraging statement it be great to start the new year with some good news and to be so clear that we be keep our promise as government it be also very good that we be take the necessary time to create this cross party consensus on social care while keep the show so firmly on the road carer will be support to carry out more health task as they do already in my constituency with wound dressing and medicine management the problem be they do not have any possibility of career progression interruption be sorry mr speaker forget your initial encouragement will bring this to close do the secretary of state agree that as carer be encourage to do more health task they need proper opportunity for career progression even within the nhs in collaboration with local authority brevity be not my hon friend new year resolution but at your encouraging mr speaker it be mine we will provide more training to care professional to deliver wide range of task in the home make well use of their skill and the career progression that my hon friend describe crucially that career progression must be in status and in pay that be what we will work with the staff to deliver call the father of the house welcome the consensual part of the secretary of state statement but wonder whether we have be entirely honest with the public about the sheer unaffordability of the cap propose by dilnot do not absolve my own government from this maybe we should start tell the truth to the public do the secretary of state think we need new social compact on bring in social insurance so that people can plan for their entire life they would know that they will have to pay more in taxis during their life for their old age but at least they would have certain right the right hon gentleman be right to say that we need debate as country about the balance of financial contribution between the individual the family and the state well understand why david cameron be so concerned about catastrophic care cost and people have to sell their home to pay for their care and the problem he be try to solve with every government since the issue have be see as less urgent than other but that do not mean it do not matter or that we should not consider it as part of the casey commission we need to consider all these issue in the round and as much as we can build consensus not just in this house but throughout the country about the balance of financial contribution and what be fair equitable and sustainable just before christmas one of my constituent visit my surgery and give pause to reflect on the massive often lifelong impact on love one who have someone in the social care system and the devastating impact on their ability to work and to live healthy fulfil life do the secretary of state agree that the commission will lay the foundation for real change so that people in the social care system and their family can live the healthy fulfil life they deserve strongly agree with my hon friend who have do much already in the past six month to champion social care whether people be in residential care home setting or we be do everything we can to ensure that they can stay in their own home everyone deserve to live comfortably well support with independence and with dignity that be why the step we be take particularly through the disabled facility grant will be immediately impactful on thousand of people across the country in just the next three month we have so much more to do and that be why be genuinely excited by the work of the commission call the chair of the select committee give that the health and social care committee first inquiry be adult social care reform the cost of inaction we welcome any action as the name of the inquiry suggest we be concerned about the length of time take because every year without reform cost money not only to the nhs but to the wide economy and in people life we have andrew dilnot in front of we on wednesday and it be year since his report which have be put into legislation twice ask the secretary of state to be specific what will stop the next iteration of the committee have louise casey in front of it in year time what will be different this time so that we get that cross party consensus and it stick that be great question first will put on my shin pad and crash helmet if andrew dilnot be in front of the hon lady select committee this week can well understand his frustration he be decent man who do an excellent piece of work it must be frustrating to see one government after the next not implement something that be welcome the issue for we as an incoming government be that the money be not there and even if it have be the system have not be set up to deliver for the october deadline we choose to act on other immediate pressure in other area because we see those need as more pressing that do not mean for moment that think andrew dilnot work be no long valuable think it might well be however we have to consider the issue in the round and come up with clear and sustainable plan that we can stick to on why the casey commission will be different and will work it be important to have as much political consensus around the house as possible the national consensus and get the public on board will be important anyone who have ever meet louise casey will know she be difficult woman to say no to have no doubt that if louise casey say something need to be do this government and future government whoever be in government will make sure that it happen happy new year mr speaker yesterday and over the christmas recess be work shift in my local at st george in tooting up and down the country doctor like be see old and disabled patient who could not be discharge from hospital due to lack of good affordable social care in the community so welcome the step that have be outline what step will the secretary of state outline to ameliorate the imminent pressure soon thank my hon friend for the work that she do on the nhs frontline particularly when parliament be in recess but often alongside her everyday work as member of this house it be truly above and beyond the call of duty she see at first hand the pressure and failure that the nhs be experience my hon friend be right about delay discharge in fact when be at burnrigg court residential care home in carlisle last week see wonderful ensuite room facility with people in intermediate nhs care there be nhs fund bed in those care home and those people be in well setting at half the cost of the hospital bed they leave behind deliver well care in the right place at the right time be often not only great for patient but well value for taxpayer that be why will be reform the well care fund to ensure that we make good use of nhs and social care budget together to get people out of hospital as quickly as possible free up vital bed capacity for other congratulate the secretary of state on take community diagnostic hub and expand their hour which be something that the last conservative government establish will he outline what impact that will have on his workforce plan and expand on that have the union accept the extra hour they be not excessive by any stretch that he have propose will he have serious conversation with please about fareham community hospital which have space for community diagnostic centre that would be welcome by my constituent in hamble valley persistence pay off would be happy to receive representation from the hon member about his local hospital and the potential to provide more community diagnostic on the workforce when we be consult on this in opposition we find real willingness on the part of nhs staff to put in the extra hour so long as they be fairly remunerate which they will be be grateful for the investment that the chancellor have provide to enable we to do that nhs staff want to see progress to beat the backlog they be as frustrated as anyone else and demoralise actually at work see people wait for so long so have no doubt about their willingness to assist be look forward to work with nhs staff across the country so that we can all feel that together we be deliver an improve nhs rise we be go to finish at about to so the speedy we go the more that will help thank nhs staff for work under severe duress over this winter one way of ensure well patient flow be to have well rehabilitation so will my right hon friend say what he be do to improve rehabilitation access not only in acute sector but out in the community far to the previous question we will be refreshing and update the nhs workforce plan alongside the long term plan that we will publish in may and my hon friend be right that rehab be key not just to good recovery but to prevention of future demand on the nhs see great example of that rehabilitation deliver in social care setting only last week whether in the nhs or in social care we definitely need to do more on rehabilitation because rehabilitation be often secondary prevention agree with the secretary of state that community base service be crucial my local nhs trust contact in the week before christmas about hereford community diagnostic centre which be currently in the process of be build it be tell to be ambitious with this project but in december it be tell that only sixth of the funding that it need be available do today announcement mean that the government will fully fund hereford community diagnostic centre we will certainly write to the hon member with further information about hereford cdc on capital investment say to she and to other right hon and hon member that we be very pleased with what the chancellor be able to deliver in the budget we recognise that the stop start we see on number of capital programme under our predecessor be frustrating and we be determined not to repeat that that be why we be set out clear and consistent proposal for capital investment in the nhs last summer we celebrate the anniversary of the elective orthopaedic centre in south west london the drive force behind that be professor richard field who come to my surgery every week after the election with the help of the prime minister tony blair and the late health secretary frank dobson he make it real it have the low blood use rate for hip and knee replacement the short stay and low level of infection will my right hon friend congratulate professor richard field and agree that his elective hub be the way to cut waiting list warmly congratulate professor richard field on his clinical leadership which have make difference to countless life not only in my hon friend part of london but because of the national example that he set which many other follow that confirm my strong conviction that the good innovation will come from great clinician it be our determination to make sure that senior leadership in the nhs and in government back great clinical leadership and innovation and take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs the secretary of state say that patient have to stay in hospital bed because of lack of social care yet we have it kick down the road once again what will louise casey tell we that we do not already know about the tough political trade off that have lead successive government to fail to create truly coherent health and social care system and what will he do to make sure that we meet need today as he exemplify in november once again the arsonist be complain that the fire brigade be not do quick enough job we be bit sick of it on the government benches but we be at least roll up our sleeve get on with the job and make improvement and we will continue to do that hear the same complaint about darzi what can darzi tell we that we do not already know quite lot actually the conservatives should hang their head in shame for it thank the secretary of state for his clear commitment to action there be vacancy in the social care sector and low wage be the prime culprit last year unison find that three quarter of care staff who do home visit continue not to be pay for journey time between appointment will my right hon friend commit to ensure both an hour minimum wage in the social care sector and pay travel time as contractual requirement thank my hon friend for that question be proud member of unison and be proud of its work to stand up for its workforce in the social care sector she and unison be absolutely right to argue that fair pay be essential to recruitment and retention that be why be delighted that the deputy prime minister include fair pay agreement in the employment rights bill in the first day be look forward to work with unison gmb and other to negotiate the first ever fair pay agreement for care professional in this country would appreciate it if the secretary of state could unpack phrase in his statement he say where we can treat work people fast we will that phrase be ripe for misinterpretation please could he explain what that mean do it mean stay at home mum wait for an appointment and family carer of whom be on waiting list it do be talk about the fact that work class people be often leave behind in two tier system where those who can afford it pay to go private and those who can not are leave behind it be the determination of this government to bring back to life the essential bevanite principle of an nhs that be there for everyone when they need it healthcare available to all on the basis of need not on ability to pay welcome the commission which hopefully will lead to some certainty on the future of social care however national audit office report find that of local authority director of social service be concern about their ability to meet statutory obligation last year and further be concerned about their ability this year have concern about what will be do to fix the immediate crisis in social care will my right hon friend outline what he will do to guarantee the sustainability of our care system now while we await the further structural reform that we dearly need be grateful to my hon friend for his question that be why in the budget the chancellor deliver big uplift in the spending power of local authority with million ringfence specifically for social care we be also deliver through measure such as the disabled facility grant to deal immediately with the it be no good the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart complain he vote against the investment so he can not very well complain about it the previous labour government do hatchet job on community hospital include in wiltshire with consequent uptick in the amount of delay discharge in the acute sector notably at bath salisbury and the great western in swindon will the casey commission look at that and find way of unpick the damage that be do the previous labour government deliver the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in history there be very worrying report of cash strap university reduce the number of clinical academic indeed some be be make redundant at time when there be increase demand for doctor do the secretary of state agree that this be an extremely concern development clinical academic have an important role to play in the national health service and in innovation in medicine my right hon friend the secretary of state for education be focus on university finance and think university should ensure that they prioritise efficiently and effectively make good use of the resource available to they would gently say that university have not struggle as much as other part of the public sector over the past year during year of austerity the nhs have be starve of the resource it badly need four month ago the secretary of state for wales make big announcement about cross border nhs partnership to tackle waiting list however the first minister of wales later pour cold water over the idea and today plan for england do not mention wales be this so call partnership ever real or be it just another empty promise by definition an elective recovery plan for england do not include wales however can assure the hon lady that we have great work relationship with jeremy miles the health minister in the welsh government and with the first minister herself not only be we provide support to the welsh government on elective reform to help they to cut waiting list and waiting time but we be receive advice from the welsh government on area where health and social care service be do well than in england together we will create rise tide that lift all ship across the uk bassetlaw have an increasingly old population with now over the age of as the need of my constituent change welcome the additional in funding for local disabled facility grant do the secretary of state agree that it be vital to shift care out of our hospital and into our community be so grateful to my hon friend for her question and for champion that issue since she arrive in the house six month ago the disabled facility grant be not just about new handrail new ramp new accessible kitchen and bathroom and home adaptation it be about freedom independence dignity and happiness it be really good investment in prevent demand on other health and care service by give people back their own independence and happiness my constituent will welcome the opportunity to get more service deliver through their gp surgery of which there be many excellent example in west worcestershire and through community hospital however hear from those very same gp surgery their concern over the national insurance rise and how that be lead they to think about reduce service when will the secretary of state be able to square that circle before christmas appreciate that it be just before but want to get out the certainty to general practitioner before we all go off for christmas we announce the big uplift in funding for general practice in considerable number of year and we will now negotiate the contract in the usual way that should give general practitioner the stability and certainty to know that this government be determined to fix the front door to the nhs the other thing would say to the opposition be that they can not continue to welcome the investment while oppose the mean of raise it unless they spell out which service they would cut or which other taxis they would increase they do not have an answer they do not have leg to stand on warmly welcome the secretary of state statement and his emphasis on investment and reform will he say little more about the important role of training for staff and investment in new technology such as ai to speed up diagnostic of the many great possibility and opportunity face this country be our strength in life science and medical technology if we can combine the strength of our scientific and technological base with the ingenuity and care of our nhs staff and our ability to deliver at scale with the model that be design in which be well serve to take we well into the century the sky be the limit for what we can achieve we will have to support staff through that revolution appreciate that for many staff work in the nhs today they would be grateful if the machine simply turn on when they turn up for work be concerned about the lengthy timescale set out in the social care review with the second phase not due to report until the care system be break and it particularly affect rural area such as glastonbury and somerton for example resident in castle cary year old day veteran be face move care home due to high care cost this will have negative impact on his health wellbeing and quality of life what action will the secretary of state take in the near term to reform the social care sector and provide old people with the dignity they deserve be very grateful for that question for two reason first it give the chance once again to say that the first part of the casey commission will be report next year so we can set out whole range of further action that will be need throughout this parliament we have take great number of action already in the first six month and dare say there will be more to follow in the next month must say it be very encouraging that one thing we be hear from across the house on the casey commission overall be to go fast think that show genuine cross party appetite on this issue and that be really good place to start welcome the secretary of state commitment to tackle the backlog of appointment all our constituent would benefit from that and his honest recognition that there be risk because there be not two separate workforce unless we have sensible safeguard we could end up pay the same nhs doctor more to do operation in the private sector the secretary of state for education set cap on the profit that can be make in the child care sector be the secretary of state consider similar cap to protect the nhs and ensure value for money in his work with the independent sector in the nhs be grateful for that question be not sure that the level of exploitation in either independent healthcare or adult social care mirror what we have see disgracefully in child social care but we keep sharp eye on that remind my hon friend of the commitment we make in opposition around tackle the excess and the bad kind of behaviour of some private equity own care home that be leech money out of the system we will not tolerate that we will act to regulate far hope that provide member across the house with the assurance that we be take both principled and pragmatic approach to the constructive and positive relationship we want to build with the independent sector as we rebuild our national health service and build national care service we can be proud of would love to see consensus evolve on social care welcome the secretary of state appointment of louise casey and the talk about the balance between the individual family and the state however in every fiscal event that be part of in the treasury more money be put into the nhs so respectfully ask the secretary of state this what do he say about wide variance in performance across the nhs secondly what do he say about consumption pattern understand his emphasis on the deliveroo concept but we have to come to term with the fact that most gps would say that they have excessive demand from people who do not really need to see their gp that be delicate and difficult subject to grasp but one that we really must grasp collectively in this place be grateful for that thoughtful question let say two thing to the right hon gentleman the first relate to the wide fiscal pressure on the chancellor find it difficult enough to manage the different choice and trade off to be make between different part of health and social care and the compete challenge that hear from member in all part of the house so be always thankful that be not the chancellor of the exchequer who have to balance demand from the nhs alongside the demand of education rise welfare bill rise child poverty and the threat to our nation these be enormous challenge which be why be determined to ensure that every penny that go into the health service be well spend my second responsibility in addition to ensure that patient be treat at the right time in the right place and in the right way be ensure that we have sustainable healthcare system in which there be reduce demand that mean do more on the prevention side so that we can keep people out of hospital and not need to knock on the door of their gp surgery so that they do not achieve the frequent flier status in the nhs that so many people do achieve the one frequent flier status to which they do not aspire we can deal with this only through both health service reform and public health reform and want very much to build cross party consensus on the latter order that be very lengthy answer just before christmas meet care worker in my constituency who tell about the day to day work that they do support the most vulnerable people in our community do the secretary of state agree that just as access to gps help to relieve pressure on hospital and department an adequate number of adult social care worker will help to relieve the pressure on our gp service which also have to deal with huge demand wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend who have do much to bang the drum on this issue during the six month in which she have be member of this house that be why we be take systematic approach to health and social care reform thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement and for write to the leader of my party be sure that the scottish government will co operate and engage fully with baroness casey as she do her work the secretary of state speak of failure one such failure the elephant in the room in fact be the labour shortage that the nhs and social care be experience as result of brexit ask he not to pass the buck but to tell what step he will take after consultation with cabinet colleague to address those shortage by make it easy for migrant worker to come to this country and fill the vacancy we have referendum and two subsequent general election on the issue of brexit and can tell the hon gentleman that none of those three democratic event go the way that want as we say to people at the time the country choose path that would have consequence and implication however we have constructive work relationship with our friend and ally in the european union and while we can not change the past we can build new partnership and bright future for our country as my right hon friend will know large number of elderly people be admit to hospital through with respiratory condition what plan do he have to strengthen the community respiratory team who do great deal of good work but could do more work if they have the resource to prevent admission and certainly readmission my hon friend be right and that be why the vaccination campaign have be so important this winter he be also right about the importance of community base team one of the darzi conclusion be that since we have significantly increase staffing in our hospital but because we have the wrong people in the wrong place we end up with fall productivity in hospital we need shift out of hospital into the community which be what our year plan will deliver most residential social care in england be deliver by the private sector be the secretary of state able to give local authority the resource necessary to allow they to reopen residential care facility or to open the new facility that be so desperately need will he assure that in the review that baroness casey be undertake the primary objective will be the delivery of public sector national care service not privatised service thank to the decision take by the chancellor in the budget we be boost the spending power of local authority significantly and million have be ringfence specifically for social care appreciate that single budget can not undo year of conservative failure but this be an important start and of course we want year on year improvement in the delivery of social care baroness casey will consider all these issue and also how we can improve ease of access and care quality across the public and private sector strongly welcome the government action to help my constituent in leyton and wanstead get the care that they need fast our local hospital whipps cross continue to struggle despite the hard work of its staff and leader nhs worker and carer who continue to provide service to our community over christmas in november of patient at whipps wait more than four hour for emergency care in recent week have wait long than hour do my right hon friend agree that this welcome package of long term reform will address both elective care and emergency care for our constituent by move the effort from hospital to the community my hon friend be absolutely right about that if we improve the service at whipps cross hospital for his constituent it will have the add benefit of improve the service at whipps cross hospital for my constituent too what be miss from today announcement be any sort of update on the new hospital programme review which be vital in my constituency of south west devon because derriford hospital need its urgent and emergency care centre to bring down ambulance wait time before it can even start to tackle its general waiting list issue when will derriford hospital hear whether it have be successful in the new hospital programme review be grateful to staff at derriford hospital for show at first hand the emergency department pressure when visit just before christmas have also visit derriford at the height of summer when it experience high pressure there be year round difficulty at derriford and thank the staff and leadership of the hospital for what they be do in difficult circumstance we will come forward shortly with the timetable for the new hospital programme expect that it will be publish soon than the conservatives apologise for their appalling record welcome my right hon friend statement but can he expand bit more on the new agreement with the private sector for example he mention that the surgical hub will be deliver solely by the private sector but what arrangement will there be for emergency care when the occasion arise some of the new capacity announce in today elective reform plan will come through the independent sector and some of that new capacity will be in the nhs it be our ambition to rebuild the nhs so that it be available for everyone where and when they need it and we will work with the independent sector we be publish full detail of our independent sector agreement so that people can see the deal that we have reach and the sensible and effective partnership include safeguard and protection that we have come to look forward to work with the sector to make sure that everyone whatever their income and background can get fast access to care when the casey review report if its recommendation be implement it will have significant impact on local government as the secretary of state will be aware large part of the country be go through local government reorganisation and the outcome of the casey review will determine the right reorganisation for those area in the good interest of join up government to use an old blairite phrase be there any way to bring forward the review so that the good choice for local government reorganisation can be make can definitely reassure the right hon gentleman that the deputy prime minister and be work very closely on this issue which be close to her heart she have huge amount of experience in this area we will follow her progress as she embark on her local government reform baroness casey will take those reform into account when she consider what the long term future for social care will look like once again note the exhortation to go fast when raise concern about gp appointment gps tell that they have difficulty recruit to post in their practice too few newly qualified doctor choose general practice as their profession what can we do to get those doctor in place so that we can make diagnostic in the community work that be an excellent question have put in place fund to ensure that there be more gps on the frontline before april and have announce just before christmas significant uplift for general practice hope that in the first six month of this government we have send the strong message to people who aspire to long career in medicine that general practice have huge role to play in the nhs in the century it be an exciting place to be but recognise that we have to fix the front door to the nhs to make it more attractive the situation be even bad than my hon friend have describe because when the conservatives leave government there be qualified gps unable to find job at time when patient be unable to find gps we get to work on that issue within week of take office and we will do more over the next month it be good to hear the late announcement on overhaul the increasingly costly care for old and disabled people and very much welcome what the secretary of state have say understand that this will happen through three year review and that we will be clear on the plan to introduce this in health be devolve to northern ireland but thousand of care package in northern ireland be not fulfil what can he do to assist northern ireland in achieve its goal goal that be set here for england and the united kingdom need to be in place in northern ireland as well the ministerial team and have enjoy work with counterpart in the devolved government over the last six month and we will continue to do that thank to the decision that the chancellor take in the budget we see significant investment in health and care service here in england and the barnett consequential will create rise tide that will lift all ship across england wales and scotland might even say that all road lead to westminster say this to scottish national party colleague down the road to westminster lie the resource for the snp government so they do not have an excuse not to act rise be sorry that we could not get everybody in try to

another say they be unable to return home until mid summer after last year winter flooding their experience and those of many resident across somerset and those set out in the national flood risk assessment show that heavy rainfall and rise sea level already threaten million property so will the minister commit to ensure that agency such as natural england and the environment agency be properly fund to deal with flooding and future flooding the hon lady be right to point out the impact on people mental health urge she to invite community that experience repeat flooding to look at the build back better scheme they could be able to access an extra to make their home more resilient to flooding as say this be something that care deeply about as do the department which be why we be invest billion in deliver improve and maintain flood defence mr wilson of blackstope lane in retford contact this morning worry that water be once again come close to his property he have be flood out

have make difference and the water have be keep at bay mr wilson hope be that that will continue share my hon friend thank to the environment agency it do an incredible job and be out there work new year eve and new year day not celebrate like many of we but out help and support be pleased to hear that positive story from her constituency the people of spelthorne have be hold their breath during this flood season obviously prevention be well than cure can the minister update we on the river thames scheme and on when decision about whether it will go ahead and when will be take just mention in response to the shadow minister that we should be able to announce which scheme have be successful by next month at the late if the hon gentleman write to with more information can give he more detailed response on the scheme he mention but recognise how important many of the scheme be to so many people have be personally affect by flooding in our family home be flood when the river caldew in carlisle burst its bank can testify as we have already hear to the terror and powerlessness that people feel when their home be invade by water although over the past few week we have escape flooding in carlisle tomorrow mark year since carlisle be flood and three resident margaret threlkeld margaret porter and michael scott lose their life at that point the labour government commission and complete flood defence but they prove insufficient to hold back the river eden in and the city be flood again flood defence be commission but not complete by the last government do the minister agree that it be unacceptable that the resident of carlisle have be leave unprotected as result of the last government inaction hear the news that anybody have lose their life in flood event be truly devastating and my sympathy be with the family and love one of those victim my hon friend be right to point out the importance of deliver on the promise to build flood defence and to highlight that poor maintenance of flood defence put an additional home at risk of flooding she have already prove herself to be fantastic champion by get hold of at every available opportunity to advocate for her constituency and long may she continue to do so number of my constituent have be affect by flooding and in variety of way the minister mention in her opening statement the breach of the bridgewater canal the damage that that have cause in cheshire and the immediate repair work that need to be do by peel what be be do to ensure that local authority clear block drain because that be the root of most of the flooding the right hon lady be right that we need combination of thing to deal with flooding there be concern around the canal which be aware of and be grateful for she mention it but it be important to look at lot of different thing include clear out culvert and drain where appropriate many thing need to be do together to ensure that we build resilience to flooding we can not put all our egg in one basket but certainly take more of those small action will have cumulative effect and help the situation over the past hour heavy rainfall have lead to flooding in my constituency in loughborough quorn and hathern year ago the prime minister visit loughborough when that bout of flooding ruin home we be both deeply move the secretary of state my right hon friend the member for streatham and croydon north steve reed have also visit those home be grateful that the minister have strengthen flood defence since she be appoint be incredibly grateful that this time the flood have leave less damage but heavy rainfall will come due to climate change will the minister set out how this government will protect home in my community and will she meet to discuss how we can do everything we can to protect our home again my hon friend be right to point out how devastating flooding be would of course be happy to meet he and discuss the situation in his constituency but just to reassure he we will spend billion in the next two year to strengthen improve and maintain our flood defence the million investment in the salisbury river park scheme be fantastic intervention but urge the minister to continue work with the environment agency to find mechanism with which parish can work collaboratively with it to develop small scheme beyond the crisis management that she and the environment agency be work on at the moment do she recognise that there be concern about inadequate scrutiny of the increase flood risk around new development if we be to reassure our constituent when more housing be put into the mix it be important that there be proper consideration of the effect on flood risk many people in salisbury remain concerned about those outcome the right hon gentleman be always welcome to urge to do many thing his proposal on how the environment agency work with local parish be an interesting one and would be happy to hear more of his thought on it to reassure people about new home we have commit to build more high quality well design and sustainable home and to ensure that they do not increase flood risk and be not at risk of flooding if alternative site be not available and development need to be in location where there be risk of flooding they must be flood resilient and resistant for their lifetime and must not increase overall flood risk put on record my thank to city of york council worker as well as to the environment agency for protect our city over the new year period many business in my city flood periodically will the minister think again about review of the insurance system for business so that they have resilience and confidence move forward thank my hon friend for her question and for join the call that we hold with all the different organisation on the friday anticipate that might be push on that question and have to admire her persistence on it of course understand the importance of flood re and of business have insurance the flood re scheme be originally design in very specific way but be always happy to take further representation from my hon friend receive an email from laura constituent in abingdon she live in an area that have be flood three time in the past year in fact there be flood warning for the river ock again today she say that the flooding mean she can not sell her house nor can any of her neighbour as estate agent say that it must be five year dry before they will even consider it as result my constituent stand to lose million between they and some have lose job because they can not move what work be the department do with estate agent and the building industry to ensure that newly build house be build well and that house that need to be sell can be sell as outline early we will ensure that any new home be resistant to flooding and importantly do not contribute to more flooding in other area that be incredibly important do not know the detail of the area and the constituent the hon lady mention such as whether flood scheme be ready to be develop there or they have think about property flood resilience measure but if she give more information will happily look at it thank the minister for the call on friday welcome her commitment to support my constituent and improve our flood defence as well as maintain defence it be very much about maintain exist infrastructure and ensure in particular that our drain be unblocked to reiterate the point make by the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey staffordshire county council have an important role to play in that in newcastle under lyme but it be very much missing in action what engagement have the minister have with local government and will she meet to discuss the specific flooding challenge face by constituent in madeley silverdale cross heath alsagers bank and those use the subway in town part of the reason that we want to set up the flood resilience taskforce be to end the siloe work between different government organisation it be jointly chair by and minister from the ministry of housing communities and local government so that we can look at where issue overlap how can turn down an invitation to meet my hon friend across my constituency be it in grendon or bugbrooke flood warning come hour after the flood event have occur what action will the minister take to ensure that flood warning be timely and accurate that be really important question and be grateful that the hon lady have raise it of course in the majority of situation in which flood warning go out people be give timely notice again ask all member to please encourage their constituent to sign up for flood warning but be now look at situation in which those warning be not receive in time with the met office and the environment agency to understand why that have happen and how we can improve it in the future we need to ensure that people be get those warning as quickly as possible so that they can take the action need visit the village of wolston in my constituency this morning meet the council emergency team and member of the flood action group see the community spirit in action with refreshment be supply by volunteer at the baptist church most importantly visit resident who have be suffer one of the issue raise with be the property flood resilience grant and its operation resident mention that they need to find for survey and that contractor ask for before they give quote they talk about major delay and see the consequence of those delay because some of the house that be flood would have benefit from the preventive measure will the minister take look at that mechanism and write to about it of course where scheme be not work as effectively as they should where there be room for improvement this government will make sure they do everything they can to improve thing and make they well be happy to receive that communication like the shadow minister feel like bit of stuck record on the topic of flooding this be the fourth month run in which have speak on it in the house because it be the fourth month run in which my constituency have be flood today yet again road be inundate train be cancel and home be take in water in her statement the minister mention the fact that climate change mean that these incident will become more frequent and severe but there be no explicit mention of climate adaptation in the measure she set out in our response to this issue we surely have to take the challenge of climate adaptation seriously as whole of government challenge the chair of the climate change committee have say that the uk be not ready so what be the minister do with colleague across government to ensure we take the challenge of climate adaptation as seriously as possible otherwise we will be back here month after month can not speak for all of government but can certainly speak for what we be do about property flood resilience how we make our home more resilient to flooding we know that flooding be go to become more frequent because of change to the climate so climate adaptation be an area be very keen on that be why meet with all the insurance company last year bring they all together because want every single insurance company to offer build back well make more home flood resilient of course it be important that we look not only at retrofit what we already have but at what be happen with new build echo the minister heartfelt sympathy for those feel the impact of flooding and those who be in fear of future flooding also echo she thank to the service and community who have help those victim in drayton and farlington in my constituency groundwater flood up through the drain into house drive garden and business despite be contact by resident and by myself southern water have not act because it be not sewage would like to see defra work with water company and local government to ensure that type of flooding be also take seriously to make sure that resident and business be listen to and to improve resilience in our drainage system share my hon friend upset about the fact that this issue be not be take seriously enough by southern water but have know she for very long time have no doubt that if there be someone who will make that company listen it be she be happy to support she with that draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and thank everyone who have be out help over the past few day every time there be heavy rainfall or storm road all across broxbourne flood from stanstead abbotts to waltham cross what action will the minister department take to decrease flood event in build up area we in broxbourne have not always see the good side of the environment agency so what can we do to increase its accountability as well thank the hon gentleman for his question and be sorry to hear that the experience of the environment agency have not be what he expect would be more than happy to put he in touch with the ea area director so that they can have conversation and work out how to improve the situation urban flooding be one of the reason we want to look at what be call suds sustainable urban drainage system and how we can integrate more of those into our community to help deal with some of the problem with surface water flooding thank my hon friend the minister for and congratulate she on how she have engage with member of this house and how she have support and my constituent in deliver pump at hartrigg oaks may invite she to support another scheme in the fordlands road area in fulford which would dramatically reduce the risk of flooding there my hon friend be very charming which always make it hard to say no would be happy to look into the scheme in more detail for he every time we have major storm or sustain rainfall the bakers arms roundabout on the become impassable trap the people of the purbecks and the town of wareham on ironically the isle of purbeck what be the minister do to bring together the department for transport the environment agency highways england and local authority to plan for main route to be prioritise for permanent flooding solution thank the hon lady for her question that be really important question because particularly today and in the past couple of day many of our highway have be impact indeed as have be mention the railway have also be impact find it more difficult to get here as know have other hon member she be quite right that we should look at work together and that may be one of the action we look at in the flood resilience taskforce also echo the word of many across the house about the work of the statutory service particularly all those who work in west lancashire our community spirit have be exceptional particularly note the work of my constituent laura caunce from the ormskirk community group who have co ordinate volunteer on the ground and have run crowdfunder and raise over already to support local people affect by flood welcome the minister statement and many of the announcement particularly the million for internal drainage board my hon friend will be aware that there be some part of the country such as mine in west lancashire that can not get an idb because legislation prevent the creation of new one what timeline be we look at for bring forward legislation so that we can really move forward on flood prevention and water management in west lancashire thank my hon friend and congratulate her constituent who have manage to raise which be incredible be at heart an optimist and always see the bright side the silver lining in the cloud have definitely be see community come together and people work together despite the horrible situation they have be face be work on the issue of create more internal drainage board at the moment be sorry that can not give an exact timeline but can tell she be work on it right now it be widely know that the more impermeable the land pavement road and housing development for example the more likely we be to see flooding with this in mind and also bear in mind the minister response early about ensure that new housing development be not at risk of flooding what assessment have the government make of the downstream impact of development and what be happen with flooding far down the valley that be an important question without go into this in too much detail one of the important thing when look at sustainable urban drainage solution be how they be go to work in community because we can not solve problem in one area and say we be deal with flooding there if it create problem somewhere else part of the calculation that need to be make if we be to use suds in new development be exactly to make sure that it be not go to impact on or increase the likelihood of flooding somewhere else otherwise the system be not work effectively it be really important issue and be grateful that the hon member have raise it thank the minister for her statement as major incident have be declare in leicestershire want to thank our emergency responder our local government and the environment agency but also want to thank and honour the amazing work of our flood volunteer speak to one this morning who be exhausted have be up all night pay tribute to she could the minister confirm how local community such as mine in measham packington and long whatton will be support in the long term to recover from repeat flood event at what point will we see stop to these event in our community thank my hon friend be sure her constituent have do an incredible job the flood group have do an amazing job and understand why she must be feel so exhausted we have mention the impact that flood event have on people mental health we want to look at area at risk of repeat flooding in the flooding formula review to make sure that those area be get the support they need the immediate post flood situation be of course for mhclg but if can help in any way she need only to contact many of we recognise that our drainage network be in disrepair in many place much of that stem from the environment agency main river designation an enormous amount of bureaucracy be require in order to get permission to unblock what be nominally call main river but to almost all of we be ditch these ditch network be very broad in northmoor and bablock hythe in my constituency virtually every ditch be main river which mean that in one case we require about three year to get permit from the ea that make thing extremely difficult and nothing ever get do we have have five permit in five year from the ea throughout the west oxfordshire district will the minister please consider do two thing make it easy to de designate main river to ordinary watercourse and simplify the ea permit procedure which be incredibly byzantine so that people can apply for permit and be able to unblock their ditch be incredibly interested in what the hon gentleman have have to say because the last thing we want be it take five year to deal with problem when there be simple solution for it if unwanted bureaucracy be cause problem would like to try and help ask the hon member please to send all the information be happy to have that conversation with the ea and let we see what can be do there be load of landowner in suffolk who want to take step to mitigate flooding the problem be they need flood risk assessment permit but frap be expensive and hard to come by so what can the department do to make they easy to access and cheap that would make real difference thank the hon gentleman that be another interesting and thoughtful question be happy to look into this in more detail for he because if there be rule and regulation that be not work as new government we do not need to keep they if they be not work let we change thing and make thing well the hon member should send the information and can have proper look at it return to the issue of wide infrastructure in surface water flooding recent example in my constituency include householder who have be affect by water run from an incomplete major housing development who have be tell nothing can be enforce until the development be finish and another where road safety scheme be funnel water into their property what action will the government take to ensure that infrastructure be be design with surface water flooding in mind and to ensure that developer have to provide appropriate drainage right the way through the build out of major development be really sorry to hear about the hon lady constituent face such an incredibly unfair situation for anybody to have to deal with that be why the fact that sustainable drainage system and schedule to the flood and water management act that we bring in be never enact be so important and that be why we be look at that now because there need to be adequate drainage system in new design that should have be in place since but the previous government do not enact it this government be serious about get on with it echo the comment of my hon friend the member for broxbourne lewis cocking although be incredibly grateful to lot of frontline worker from the environment agency and elsewhere for the work they have do to keep house and business safe we have not always see the good of the ea as an organisation councillor tommy threlfall our cabinet member and other community member and business owner be desperately try to get hold of someone at the environment agency while all the field around main drain be flood and not one of the pump at lytham pumping station be active as there be about to be high tide into the low flat land the minister refer to which be at the tail end of the risk of flooding as the water move downstream what be the minister go to do to help local community well engage with agency such as the ea in the midst of flooding to get real time information into the organisation and most importantly to get it act upon to keep business and residence safe if the hon gentleman have not have the experience he need with the environment agency be happy to take up that issue an hon friend mention good idea on the call last friday issue an emergency flood pack to mps contain all the detail and information of who to contact and when member would then have that information when they need it and be able to get hold of people exactly at the point they need to do so that issue have come out especially with it happen over new year eve people and the ea be out there work but we have to make sure we have that communication that be so incredibly important be think through different way can improve communication but will make sure that the area manager get in contact with the hon gentleman many of my constituent have be affect by flood overnight but it have be particularly bad in horley where for the second time in recent month people home have be flood by raw sewage will the minister meet to discuss what can be do to hold thames water to account in operate its sewage work particularly in the light of several new housing development in the area which will make the problem even bad and to stop it dump raw sewage in my resident home that be horrific experience and be so sorry that those people have have to deal with that will meet the hon gentleman it be so important we have that billion of investment to improve infrastructure and to upgrade the water system so that we do not keep have horrific incident such as the one he mention as member from all part of the house have already mention one of the major cause of flooding be the blockage of our drainage system and gulley unfortunately many council nationally have reduce the frequency of clean gulley due to budgetary pressure area such as my landlocked constituency be see flooding like never before my local victoria park health centre be flood as we speak will the minister commit to provide more funding for council to assist our large agency such as the environment agency thank the hon gentleman for highlight the impact that flooding have not just on home but on medical facility it be important but we need to look in the round at what make the most difference in improve flood resilience within community one of the thing have mention to many other member be the build back well scheme under which there can be an extra to make property more flood resilient it might be good to have conversation about that in term of other house in the local area so that we can improve property flood resilience flooding will not be solve by one thing we need to look at as many different thing as we can and accumulate they to make the big impact thank the minister for her statement and for her clear energy and commitment to try to make life well across the united kingdom the rain of the last few week explain the significant flooding some would say it be of biblical proportion and it have lead to many road be closed and air travel be affect for many disruption be extensive across the middle and north east of england and in other part of the united kingdom so what be be do to minimise travel disruption for so many go back to work and other go back to school this week be delighted that the hon gentleman have ask the last question on my first statement in term of what can be do we need to continue to work with other departments through the flood resilience taskforce to look at how we can improve resilience and ensure that people get back to work as he know flooding and water be devolved matter in northern ireland but it be always good to get he in at the end child sexual exploitation and abuse before call the home secretary to make the statement on child sexual exploitation and abuse have statement to make on behalf of mr speaker remind members of the house sub judice resolution which prohibit reference be make to any active criminal case member should therefore not make any reference to any active case in which an individual have already be charge child sexual abuse and exploitation be the most vile and horrific of crime involve rape violence coercive control intimidation manipulation and deep long term harm the information from the crime survey should be chilling to all of we it estimate that half million child every year experience some form of child sexual abuse violence and sexual violation in the home repeat rape or exploitation by groom or paedophile gang threat and intimidation involve intimate image online or abuse within institution that should have protect and care for young people cruel and sadistic crime against those who be most vulnerable all of we have responsibility to protect our child perpetrator must be punish and pursue and victim and survivor must be protect and support but these crime have not be take seriously for too long and far too many child have be fail that be why this government be determined to act strengthen the law take forward recommendation from independent inquiry and support strong police action and protection for victim there be no excuse for anyone not to take these crime seriously brave survivor speak out have shine light on terrible crime and the failure of institution to act be it in care home in rochdale asian grooming gang in rotherham or telford the abuse cover up within faith institution include the church of england and the catholic church or within family home that report alongside the come to light of other appalling crime be why our party when in opposition call for national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and support that work when it be launch by the previous government over seven year that inquiry expertly lead by professor alexis jay engage with more than victim and survivor process million page of evidence and publish report and publication the finding should be truly disturbing for everyone they describe the pain and suffering cause to victim and survivor and the deviousness and cruelty and perpetrator nor be there any excuse for anyone not to recognise and act on the deep harm and damage of organise gang exploitation abuse sexual assault and rape ten year ago two report by alexis jay and louise casey in rotherham find that child have be sexually exploit rap by multiple perpetrator traffic across other town abduct beat and threaten with gun child have even be douse in petrol girl as young as have be rap those report decade ago identify failure to confront pakistani heritage gang and widespread perception that they should downplay the ethnic dimension for fear of be see to be racist when those report come out those failing in rotherham be condemn across the board by both government and opposition in this house as say at the time it be never an excuse to use race and ethnicity or community relation as an excuse not to investigate and punish sex offender official report september vol the then home secretary make it clear that cultural concern the fear of be see as racist must never stand in the way of child protection official report september vol the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse also run specific investigation strand into child sexual exploitation by organise network which run for two year and produce separate report in february it conclude that police force and local council be still fail to tackle this serious crime and set out further recommendation for change but despite those different inquiry draw up multiple recommendation far too little have actually be do none of the recommendation from the independent inquiry into child abuse have be implement as the act on iicsa campaign group from the survivors trust say this week victim of child sexual abuse can not afford further delay in meaningful action it be imperative to keep the focus on radical reform two different conservative home secretaries say after the report be publish that it be watershed and should be the beginning of new chapter for change but that have not happen we now need new impetus and action since come into office the safeguarding minister have meet with professor alexis jay and survivor and have convene the first dedicated cross government group to drive forward change to ensure that victim voice remain at the very heart of this process we will set up new victim and survivor panel to work on an ongoing basis with the inter ministerial group to guide they on the design delivery and implementation of new proposal and plan not just on iicsa but on wide work around child sexual exploitation and abuse we will set out more detail and timescale base on that work before that can announce action on three key recommendation first can confirm that we will make it mandatory to report abuse and we will put measure in the crime and police bill to be put before parliament this spring to make it an offence with professional and criminal sanction to fail to report or to cover up child sexual abuse the protection of institution must never be put before the protection of child first call for this measure in response to the report and failing in rotherham year ago the prime minister first call for it year ago base on his experience as director of public prosecutions the case be clear then but we have lose decade and we need to get on with it now secondly we will legislate to make groom an aggravate factor in the sentencing of child sexual offence because the punishment must fit the terrible crime thirdly we will overhaul the information and evidence that be gather on child sexual abuse and exploitation and embe they in clear new performance framework for police so that these crime be take far more seriously one of the first recommendation of the independent inquiry be single core datum set on child abuse and protection but that have never be do we will introduce single child identifier in the children wellbeing and schools bill and much strong police performance framework include new standard on public protection child abuse and exploitation we be accelerate the work of the child sexual exploitation police taskforce set up rightly under the previous government there be increase in arrest between july and september last year that sit alongside the tackle organise exploitation programme which use advanced datum and analytic to uncover complex network datum on ethnicity be now be publish but we will work far with they to improve the accuracy and robustness of the datum and analysis we will continue to support further investigation that be need include police investigation and local independent inquiry and review which can expose failing and wrongdoing in local area and institution as we have see in telford rotherham and greater manchester we support the ongoing work commission by mayor andy burnham into historic abuse in oldham which have lead to new police investigation arrest and conviction to build on those finding the leader of oldham council have confirm this week that work to set up further local independent inquiry be already underway include liaison with oldham survivor we welcome and support this work which will put victim voice at its heart the telford inquiry be particularly effective because victim be involve in shape it at every stage tom crowther who lead that inquiry have now agree to work with the government and other local council where strong engagement with victim and survivor be need or where more formal inquiry be require to tackle persistent problem we should also be clear that wherever there have be failing or perpetrator of terrible crime have not be bring to justice the most important inquiry and investigation should be police investigation to track those perpetrator down to bring they before the court and to get victim the protection that they deserve finally we have to face the serious challenge that the fast grow area of grooming and child abuse be online we will also take much strong action to crack down on rapidly evolve form of child sexual exploitation and abuse and groom online include tackle the exponential rise in artificial intelligence facilitate child sexual abuse material we will set out significant package of measure to strengthen the law in this area in the come week for many year there have be broad cross party consensus not only on the importance of this work but that the interest of victim and survivor must come first there will be different view about the detail of the policy that be need but every one of we across this house have support action to protect our child it be the responsibility of we all to keep they safe for the future hope that member across the house will work with ministers and the victim and survivor panel that we be set up to change protection for the well and to make sure that it be perpetrator who pay the price commend this statement to the house call the shadow home secretary thank the home secretary for advance sight of her statement the whole country be shock by the rape gang scandal over year or decade thousand or maybe ten of thousand of vulnerable young girl be systematically rap by organise gang of man predominantly of pakistani heritage instead of those victim be protect and the perpetrator prosecute those girl be systematically fail many case be cover up because of absurd concern about so call community relation often the police do not investigate local council cover thing up the crown prosecution service frequently fail victim those raise concern be frequently accuse of racism never again can people be silence in that way pay tribute to people who have raise these case over the year start with former labour mp ann cryer who first raise these problem nearly two decade ago and bravely persevere despite accusation of racism and bad include from her own colleague in that vein let say word on the prime minister comment this morning it be not far right to stand up for victim of mass rape interruption order people want to hear the response to the statement smear people who raise those issue be exactly how this get cover up in the first place repeat what say yesterday intimidation and threat towards elect member of parliament and ministers include the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips be completely wrong as the home secretary say action be important the last government take extensive action start with the original jay report commission in by the then home secretary now baroness may year later she commission the independent investigation into child sexual abuse and sajid javid commission data collection in on the response to the iicsa report publish in it be not true that the last government take no action the last government establish the grooming gang taskforce whose work lead to arrest of perpetrator in the first year and safeguard victim my first question to the home secretary be therefore this will she confirm for the house be sure she can that the grooming gang taskforce work will continue and hope be step up secondly as part of the work of the grooming gang taskforce and again implement one of the recommendation of the iicsa report in april the last government mandate data collection on ethnicity as the home secretary refer to it have be go for over year and half so will she confirm that the datum on the ethnicity of perpetrator will be publish as the home secretary have acknowledge one of iicsa main recommendation be mandatory reporting to the police by people in position of responsibility the last government be in the process of implement that recommendation via measure in the criminal justice bill which fall because of the early election be glad that she have announce that she will continue with the last government proposal in her forthcoming bill she can be assure that the opposition will support the government in the continuation of that measure finally the home secretary do not address the need for full national public inquiry into this scandal while the previous government do initiate iicsa under professor jay that be mainly direct at other child sexual abuse and exploitation issue and it cover only six of the town involve in the gang rape scandal it do not cover everything we need to get to the truth we have new evidence that be of interest to the public include what simon danczuk the former labour mp for rochdale say about the way that he be pressure into stay silent we also have evidence of local authority cover this up and the third report from last year on operation span commission by the mayor of greater manchester andy burnham which expose extremely serious failing by the crown prosecution service all that need to be look into will the home secretary therefore commission national statutory public inquiry which can compel witness to attend requisition evidence and take evidence under oath if the government will not order that inquiry the opposition will table an amendment to the children wellbeing and schools bill later this week to put the matter to vote hope that member across the house will vote for that full statutory public inquiry so that we can get to the truth this be an issue on which work with government ministers when be shadow home secretary and when be chair of the home affairs committee and there have be cross party consensus on the need to tackle these serious and vile crime these be the most appalling crime against child repeat multiple brutal rape of child particularly young girl but also young boy in the most appalling circumstance and the abuse of child trust often by people who should have protect and look after they institution fail to keep they safe that be why the independent inquiry be so important why and many other across this house call for it and why we support it when the previous government set it up however there have just not be enough action to tackle these vile crime there have not be enough change to policy and to the way that service operate at local level it be deep failing that those change have not take place the shadow home secretary use the example of the duty to report which be incredibly important it be about prevent any chance of people include professional turn blind eye to abuse and cover up child abuse and exploitation in the most appalling way it be about make that criminal offence we call for that year ago his party have decade to introduce that decade that we have lose decade without those power and measure in place the hon gentleman talk rightly about the taskforce which mention we have support not just continue with that taskforce but accelerate its work the number of arrest in the most recent quarter increase significantly on the previous quarter what want to see most of all be perpetrator behind bar want to see perpetrator pay the price for these vile crime against child in order to achieve that we have to improve police performance and the co ordinate work between police and local council across the country so we will accelerate the work of the taskforce the hon gentleman refer to the ethnicity datum which be publish in november the late report be publish in november as result of the taskforce work however do not think the datum that have be gather be adequate it do not go far enough there be real problem with the way that police force collect datum which be very haphazard there be not proper system for collect datum or proper performance framework for police to be honest think that his government withdraw too far from police and from have the kind of standard that we need to have in place hope that we can work together on strong performance framework and clear framework for datum include for deal with issue around ethnicity back in we have consensus on the need to ensure that race and ethnicity be never use as an excuse not to tackle crime and that where vulnerable girl supposedly consent when they in fact do not that would not be use as an excuse not to tackle crime we can never accept those excuse hope that we will agree on how we do that on inquiry the shadow home secretary party launch the child abuse inquiry it set the term of reference and provide the substantial funding for it he could have raise concern about the inquiry term of reference and scope and the extent of its report at any point include after it report but he do not do so until last week hope that the hon gentleman will support the work that oldham be determined to take forward hopefully replicate the important telford inquiry hope too that he be prepared to work with the victim and survivor panel which will help we to take forward the further investigation review and inquiry that should take place both locally and across the country in order to protect child victim call the chair of the work and pensions committee welcome my right hon friend statement child sexual exploitation and abuse be heinous crime it happen everywhere in all community and in all setting and we must all be vigilant and do what we can to address it my right hon friend mention the importance of ensure that victim of cse be at the heart of all that we do and support she wholeheartedly on that if it be the will of the victim of the abuse in oldham to have an additional review of the circumstance that lead to their abuse will also wholeheartedly support that will my right hon friend expand on how we can transparently track progress in implement the recommendation it can not be allow that three year after we receive detailed recommendation from national independent inquiry we be still wait for their implementation my hon friend have work immensely hard to champion the victim and survivor of terrible crime she raise important point about the prevalence of these appalling crime the need to be vigilant wherever this abuse be to be find in any kind of institution across community and across the country and the importance of track progress the telford inquiry be set up in such way that tom crowther who lead the inquiry go back each year to do follow up report and to track progress which have be really important we have encourage those look at this matter in oldham to be in touch with those involve in telford and be glad that tom crowther have agree to work with the government on how we can make this work more widely call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the home secretary for advance sight of her statement no child should ever have to face sexual exploitation or abuse there should simply be no place for this horrific abhorrent behaviour in our society we must keep every child and young person impact by these terrible sicken crime in our thought today we owe it to the survivor to ensure that justice be deliver which mean require perpetrator to face the full force of the law but also ensure that the right step be take to stop child face this vile abuse in the future the expansive independent inquiry into child sexual abuse which publish its report in set out how to do just that however under the previous conservative government progress on implement iicsa recommendation stall professor alexis jay the chair of the inquiry say that she be frustrated by the then government lack of action will the home secretary say when we can expect clear timeline for the full implementation of iicsa recommendation which professor jay have urge of course that work can not be siloe in the home office so would welcome more detail about how cross government work to implement the recommendation will be co ordinated victim and survivor deserve more than warm word they deserve action it be my sincere hope that we can work together across this house to make that reality and can resist turn far too many child suffer into political football welcome the point that the hon member make historically there have be lot of consensus across the house about the importance of this work but often there have be very slow progress we have to change that she rightly say that this be not just matter for the home office or even police force local council and social service this must be about work across government and across community that be why the safeguarding minister my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips be lead cross departmental programme of work respond not just to the iicsa recommendation but to broad work some of the work around online abuse be move extremely fast and we need action there as well it be important that we set up the victim and survivor panel to work with this group the victim and survivor need to be at the heart of implementation so that they do not feel that after they give evidence to the inquiry that be it nobody ever listen again call the education committee chair helen hayes several year ago support over number of month constituent of mine who suffer horrific sexual abuse as child in the care of lambeth council as she prepare to give evidence to the independent inquiry on child sexual abuse chair by professor jay it be unimaginably hard for victim and survivor to give evidence to that inquiry relive the abuse that they suffer and be retraumatise the fact that they do so be exceptionally important and pay tribute to their courage my constituent and thousand of other victim and survivor give their evidence so that their experience could be at the heart of professor jay recommendation do the home secretary agree that if we be really to put victim and survivor first the priority must be to act on what they have already tell we and to implement the iicsa recommendation at pace and in full join my hon friend in pay tribute to her constituent and to the more than victim and survivor who give evidence to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and exploitation the inquiry take seven year many year of people bravely speak out about some of the most difficult and traumatic thing imaginable which none of we would ever want anybody to have to go through she be also right that they must not feel that their evidence be just empty word that get lose in the air even though an inquiry take place we have to make sure that there be action some of that action may be difficult and some may require very hard work but we have to make sure that we take it forward and make progress to protect child for the future call select committee member robbie moore rape gang and the grooming of child have haunt keighley and the wide bradford district for decade yet local leader have consistently refuse to launch an inquiry the national iicsa report which the home secretary be treat as silver bullet be not an inquiry into rape gang nor do it reference keighley or bradford once despite many include fear that the scale of this issue across the bradford district will dwarf the scale of the issue in rotherham if the home secretary believe that the iicsa report give we all the information that we need to tackle this vile and disgusting crime can she tell how many child across the bradford district have be abuse through child sexual exploitation who be the perpetrator and when can my constituent expect to see they behind bar or deport appalling crime have take place against child in bradford keighley and across the country truly appal crime all of we have to face up to the fact that child sexual abuse and exploitation continue this be not just about historical crime but continue crime and abuse of hundred of thousand of child across the country that be why it be so important first of all that we take forward the propose reform and that we ensure way to keep victim and survivor at their very heart some of that must be about how we change the way that police and council work together to implement reform include on the duty to report the hon gentleman raise local concern we will work with tom crowther and the victim and survivor panel on how area can well involve survivor and victim in what have happen in their area and ensure that they be properly listen to so as to get to the truth and make fundamental change in the last few day my hometown name rochdale have be exploit by some people who treat child rape as political game rather than as an appalling crime that should be deal with the horrific abuse of child by groom gang many of they predominantly pakistani heritage grooming gang be compound by failure by my local council and the local police all rochdalians whatever their background want to see sex offender prosecute swiftly and punish harshly welcome the home secretary statement and ask she to leave no stone unturned in implement all the recommendation of the jay report something the opposition signally fail to do my hon friend be right to recognise the seriousness of these crime the experience in rochdale include not just the issue around the pakistani heritage gang network that he talk about but issue in care home and other that have be investigate over the year and the terrible experience of victim and survivor and their family as result my hon friend be also right to say that we need change that have to be about how we work with victim and survivor in take forward new reform and change and how we will have to go far in series of area the thing about child abuse and exploitation be that perpetrator change all the time and look for new way to abuse child that be what we have to keep tackle one of the most shocking detail in respect of the rape gang be the evidence of collusion and corruption among police officer social worker and local councillor will the home secretary commit today to establish unit in the national crime agency dedicate to investigate not only untried perpetrator but the police officer social worker and local councillor who be complicit in these disgusting crime the hon member make an important point alongside pursue perpetrator which must always be the great priority because it be about protect victim and ensure that those who commit vile crime face justice there must be responsibility on people for their public role whether in police local council or other institution we have see issue around the church of england the catholic church and other institution that be investigate as part of the inquiry one reason why we be so keen to change the law indeed it be something raise back when the hon member be work in the home office be the importance of the duty to report that then make it an offence for public official to cover up or fail to report it be so important that we do that so that we can have proper accountability as well sincerely commend the home secretary statement the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse be extremely comprehensive over the course of seven year it examine million page of evidence and hear from over survivor every single one of whom we should pay tribute to today they relive the most horrific trauma only for the previous government to drag their heel in implement the report recommendation call for fresh inquiry from the conservatives and reform be shameful attempt to stoke division at the expense of victim survivor and child thank the home secretary for refuse to give in to that deeply harmful and offensive political point scoring will she set out timeline for when she expect to have fully implement the iicsa recommendation the clear point be as my hon friend say that victim and survivor need to be at the heart of the work to take forward the implementation of reform and change and we want to work with the new victim and survivor panel to draw up timeline recognise that some of the issue around reform be difficult and that we need extensive work with victim and survivor on how they can be deal with but there be other area in which we can move really swiftly such as change the law on the duty to report overhaul the way in which we collect information and datum and put in place proper monitoring system in local area in respect of child sexual exploitation and abuse hope we can build sense of consensus on our objective which be to protect child that be what this should all be about and hope that everyone will sign up to it considerable evidence tell we that child expose to domestic violence be at increase risk of abuse themselves grow up be one of those child and as survivor be appalled to have see the shadow home secretary weaponise this issue in the way we see early be appalled to see the like of reform play this issue like political football and be appal that zero of the recommendation in professor jay report have be implement so far in the light of the link between domestic abuse and child abuse have table bill to create dedicated set of domestic abuse offence in the law for the first time will the home secretary meet to discuss the bill provision and how we can well respect and protect survivor across the country thank the hon member for speak out about his personal experience realise that be never an easy thing to do and respect he for do it as he say there be all kind of link and domestic abuse in the household have an incredibly damaging impact on the family and on child grow up we have to see the work on the protection of child as part of the wide work on public protection and as be strongly link to our mission to halve the incidence of violence against woman and girl over the next year the safeguarding minister will be keen to discuss with the hon member his proposal relate to domestic abuse and how we can work together on these issue rise order the level of interest show how important this issue be but will struggle to get everybody in unless member keep their question short and the answer be just as short call chris murray who be member of the select committee the focus of this debate should not be on the politic on what be in the newspaper or on what be on social medium it should be on the child themselves for four year before come to the house work on prevent trafficking especially the trafficking of child victim around the country for sex the story that hear would chill your bone especially the story of those who seek protection from the authority but end up back in the hand of their trafficker there be so much more that we could do for those child know that not just from my own experience but because it be there in black and white in the finding of the inquiry we have million page of evidence and witness and zero recommendation have be implement will the home secretary commit to put safeguarding first rather than put politic first as people be so transparently try to do and implement the finding as quickly as possible welcome the work my hon friend have do in this policy area he be right to talk about young people and child be traffic around the country there be some concern evidence that for example although work have be do to identify people be traffic through county line often boy and young man it have not sufficiently identify the young woman and teenage girl who be be traffic around for sexual exploitation we need to ensure that improvement be make in that regard the labour lot over there be bang on about play politic with this important issue but the last time attend debate on child rape gang only one labour back bencher turn up they should hang their head in shame do the home secretary agree that we need specific inquiry into why young british white girl be be systematically rap by man of pakistani heritage we need to make sure that young people and child be be protect these be vile crime against child across the country we have see young girl teenager and young boy who have be exploit by perpetrator in the most cruel and horrendous way we have see abuse by pakistani heritage gang we have see paedophile gang operate online we have see abuse in community and institution and family home and all those crime be truly horrendous after the rotherham inquiry in when we see appalling abuse by in that case pakistani heritage gang call for duty to report call for the law to be change to place responsibility on public servant to report child abuse and to make it an offence to cover it up the government of whom the hon gentleman be part for many year fail to bring in that duty to report and we have lose decade we have to change the law we have to make sure that we go after abuse without fear or favour wherever it be find in order to secure justice and protection for victim and that dangerous perpetrator end up behind bar associate myself with the home secretary remark condemn those who perpetrate these horrific crime stand with all victim of child sexual exploitation and sexual violence as the hon member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore know there be an independent review of child sexual exploitation in bradford which report in cross party committee there have oversee the local change and commend the action of west yorkshire police in lock up more than perpetrator since do my right hon friend agree that the failure of the previous government to take action on the jay report be disgrace what further action by police and local authority be need to tackle these pernicious crime my hon friend have rightly refer to the work do by west yorkshire police not only to look at public protection currently but to pursue historic investigation which continue to be important because people often feel unable to come forward and tell their story about the abuse that have take place until many year later when survivor be brave enough to come forward it be incredibly important for their story to be investigate fully and for operation like those run by west yorkshire police into historic abuse to continue we owe it to victim and survivor to make sure that change happen in practice and that include change the law as part of the policing and crime bill thank the home secretary for her statement it be important to remember that these terrible crime could happen to anyone and could be perpetrate by anyone irrespective of colour class heritage or geography think the home secretary be right that the public want to see action now frankly remain unconvinced that new public inquiry will throw any new light or information on this issue the good place for victim to have their story tell be in court when the perpetrator be bring to justice may ask the home secretary to make it clear to the world of local government and police that the implementation of rule and regulation be colour and class blind too many of these victim be simply dismiss as to use that medium phrase white trash they be poor in many instance not particularly well educate often in trouble with the authority and too easily dismiss that be where the failure really take place they be dismiss for who they be that can never happen again welcome the hon member really important point about the response have to be colour blind and class blind it have to see these thing for what they be really terrible crime often against the most vulnerable young people as he say young people be dismiss because they be vulnerable due to the difficult experience that they might have have young girl be often not take seriously and myth operate in the way that service respond lot of work have be do to challenge those myth but the reality be that unless we have proper strong performance management framework in place and strong requirement on local organisation and agency to respond and to take this issue seriously enough the risk be that it just become lose in corner as oppose to be treat as the very serious crime that it be that be why we want to embed this as part of proper performance framework for policing and to work with local council too professor jay hear from my constituent terry lodge who be foster and live life of slavery with no education and no childhood he have suffer the consequence throughout his life nottinghamshire county council accept all liability for its failing to its shame the council be still to make an offer of compensation do the home secretary agree that although jay recommendation must be implement in full nottinghamshire county council must also step up and do the right thing my hon friend make really important point about the responsibility of local council to recognise the thing that have go wrong in the past to recognise the responsibility that they owe to local victim and survivor and to provide the support that those victim and survivor need know that my hon friend the safeguarding minister will keep in touch with she about progress but it be really important that all council make sure that they recognise their responsibility perpetrator of sexual crime must face the full force of the law regardless of their race their religion or their nationality but an overseas bad faith actor be use truly horrific case of group base child rape to demonise community and slander minister of the crown someone who have genuine experience of help victim of abuse this narrative be false and it be dangerous many report from to have conclude that the common denominator for sexual violence be not immigration race or culture the real point here be that if victim be be falsely tell that perpetrator look certain way or be part of certain community they will have false sense of security when they be with people who do not fit that stereotype the real issue here be that we need the discussion to be focus on victim not political rhetoric and we need evidence base policy one of the point that the independent inquiry make be about the broad nature of this abuse and the way in which it can be find anywhere when we have half million child be subject to child sexual abuse or exploitation every year there be an impact right across the country it mean that we have serious problem and failing within all kind of different institution as the inquiry find it look into issue within local council care home faith organisation include the church of england and different grooming and exploitation group wherever such abuse be find we have to treat it as terrible crime against child no excuse no excuse can be make for perpetrator and no excuse can be make for inaction there have to be strong action to go after the perpetrator whoever and wherever they be and protection for the victim whoever and wherever they be thank the home secretary for her statement under this government no matter an abuser race and where they be they will have nowhere to hide the job in hand be action implementation and change be glad to hear that she will set up new victim panel because the victim of sexual abuse woman and child be usually forget in the wild whirlwind of twitter have to say that it be usually man use this issue to grind political axe do she agree that it be not bandwagon to jump on for anybody political tv talk show this be serious issue victim deserve to lead the process and be sure she will enable that these be really serious crime for someone like alexis jay who work in this area over very many year before she lead the independent inquiry and for other who have be work in this area over very many year it have to be about the victim and survivor but it also have to be about get serious about deliver change and make sure that change happen in practice therefore it have to be about how we make sure that there be proper monitoring process to follow up change rather than just think well an announcement have be make but nothing change and nothing be actually do far more important than the debate take place on social medium be the practical plan for deliver change the government have be very keen to set up review since come into office include one on social care but they have refuse formal request from oldham council for national statutory inquiry into child sexual abuse grooming and gang rape why not let sunlight transparency and justice into the process say to the right hon lady that as make clear in my statement we support the independent review that oldham council be plan to set up we have also suggest that it work with those who be involve in the telford inquiry which be extremely effective tom crowther who lead that inquiry have agree to that interestingly one of those who give evidence to both the telford inquiry and the national inquiry have describe how she find it much easy to give evidence to the telford inquiry and think it be more effective at get to the nitty gritty of what have go wrong in telford suspect that that be why the previous government of which the right hon lady be part say repeatedly to oldham council that it should pursue the local inquiry we want to make sure that there be proper investigation inquiry and review wherever there be evidence that need to be pursue most importantly of all there have to be police investigation to get justice in the then housing communities and local government committee do report on cse in rotherham that report draw heavily on the evidence from alexis jay first report which be on the problem in rotherham the failing of the police the failing of the council and the failing of ofsted what that surely show be that local authority commission inquiry which be what alexis jay first inquiry be can get to the bottom of these problem expose the failing and lead to improvement at local level surely oldham council can do exactly the same my hon friend be right because that be the work that oldham council be now take forward we want to work with oldham council and to be able to support it and we want it to be able to see the work that be do in telford which be effective at deliver change tom crowther go back to see the work in telford to make sure that progress be be make that be crucial because it be no good just have inquiry that do not actually lead to any change or anything different happening there have to be detailed work be it at local level or at national level but there also have to be follow through the labour welsh government be responsible for child safeguarding in wales and the home secretary say that none of the independent inquiry recommendation be implement by the previous tory government six recommendation apply to wales but no new action be take there either give that her statement rightly put victim and survivor first will she tell how victim and survivor in wales will now be able to demand culture of real change many issue obviously cut across include issue around police that apply to england and wales for example the police performance framework that we be talk about and some of the data issue that we be talk about so we need to work with welsh police force and the welsh government on take the measure forward they be immensely important because part of the problem have be that there be no sense of what be actually be measure and what will actually change what be the performance standard that we expect from all police force right across the country if those do not exist too little change in practice performance management framework have be miss from wales as well as from across england and that be what we be determined to introduce the horrific case of cse and rape across the country have expose deep failure in the safeguarding of vulnerable child and as member have say there be unfortunately too many time when they be not treat as child by the agency that should have support they welcome the step that the home secretary have set out but will she ensure that there be long term funding to support survivor in rebuild their life that their voice will lead on reform and that we support local charity such as the kirklees rape and sexual abuse centre and the pennine domestic abuse partnership in my constituency which do fantastic work but have to fight for funding every year thank my hon friend for raise the local service the safeguarding minister also be strong supporter of the work that that service be do my hon friend be right about the importance of make sure that we support victim and survivor and we need to work with the victim and survivor panel on how we take that forward she be also right to say that part of the problem be that the child be not treat or respect as child they be just treat as somehow be adult and not as be exploit and subject to the most terrible of crime that be one of the fundamental thing that have to change also thank the secretary of state for her statement think the house be overwhelmingly behind she in deal with these difficult subject and implement the finding of the jay report however be listen carefully to these exchange and the argument against further public inquiry in response to my hon friend the member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore for example seem rather thin oh we have already get too much to do oh it probably will find out anything new oh let the council do it on its own just wonder whether this be in fact matter of public confidence if the home secretary can not restore public confidence without further public inquiry please will she not rule it out we obviously support the independent inquiry into child abuse include the two year investigation that it do into organise network of child sexual exploitation that be immensely important as well we also continue to support the local inquiry review and investigation include in oldham have particularly highlight the work that be do in telford and there be reason for that the telford inquiry be set up as local independent inquiry but it have prove more effective than many of the other piece of work that have be undertake in this area through have victim and survivor at the heart of that local inquiry from the very beginning they be involve not just in give evidence but in draw up and shape the way that the whole inquiry go forward it also have in place proper framework for follow up and make sure that year later progress be be make and action be be take we want to learn from what work effectively in telford interestingly that be different from what have happen in some other area so the way in which it have work be significant that be why we believe that the right next step will be for tom crowther who lead that inquiry and the victim and survivor who be involve in telford to share that experience with other area include oldham so that we can make sure we have proper framework for local area and institution to get to the truth about what have happen in their area and to ensure that change take place at the same time we must recognise that we have the two year inquiry into child exploitation nationally as part of the overarching review and that series of recommendation from the overarching review have still not be act on so let we work with the victim and survivor panel that we be determined to set up on what be the good form for future investigation and work rise order be plan to run the statement only until pm so it might be helpful if we have very short question and perhaps short answer from the home secretary may just say on behalf of every decent minded mp across the house how powerful and important it be to see the safeguarding minister here on the front bench with the home secretary it be testament to their commitment to get this matter right and not be deflect however hard other people try from what really matter which be the victim of these horrific crime be proud to sit behind they and to support the work they be do and welcome what they have say about bring in victim panel in the spirit of the cross party working that we will need to do on this may also welcome the word of the hon member for north dorset simon hoare he be right that the common story we hear time and again from victim of abuse whether from groom gang in care home or in their own home be that they be not believe nobody listen to they how can we have the national conversation that we need to have about the culture of belief put victim first and finally end the silence that have mean so many have be the victim of these perpetrator for so long my hon friend be right we have to ensure that victim voice be hear and that they can have the confidence to come forward because often they feel that they will not be believe and will not get the support they need if they do speak out that can make it extremely difficult also support her word about the safeguarding minister who not only do phenomenal job in the home office now but have be tireless champion for victim of abuse and exploitation for very many year without she there be no doubt that the home office would not be make the progress we be now make on tackle these serious crime many victim of the grooming gang still do not feel that justice have be do it be very concern that the two man lead the greater manchester inquiry resign because they feel that they be be block from access the information they need the iicsa be an important start but it be not and be never mean to be detailed report into the grooming gang it look at six place where the grooming gang operate but they operate in more than place the right hon lady say that the answer be locally lead inquiry but we have have year for that to happen and it have not happen or it have not happen properly indeed in many case the local authority be part of the problem and we be ask they to mark their own homework totally agree with she about the importance of the jay recommendation but will she please rethink so that we can actually listen to the voice of those who to this day have never be listen to the whole point of we set up victim and survivor panel be to ensure that the voice of victim and survivor continue to be hear as part of the implementation as part of the action and as part of the further investigation that need to take place this can not be case of simply have one off inquiry and then everybody turn their back move on and talk about something different we have to ensure that there be serious change there be obviously two year inquiry that look at organise grooming gang and child exploitation but we have also have the issue around telford telford be not include in detail as part of that inquiry and there will be other area where detailed question be still unresolved that be why we want tom crowther to be able to work with the government and with other area on how good to ensure that victim and survivor feel that their voice will be hear in the way that the hon gentleman describe he be right that too often they do not feel that and that be often because frankly we still need further police investigation into those terrible crime and the perpetrator who have still not be bring to justice anyone who have work with survivor as have know how extraordinarily painful but important it be to have the iicsa inquiry and for survivor to be hear to be believe and crucially to finally see action take pay tribute to the thousand of survivor who participate in the inquiry survivor should not have to repeatedly relive their trauma in order to see action finally be take and they have tell we that now be the time for action refer to the recent quote from alexis jay who describe the inaction of the previous government as weak and apparently disingenuous with regard to what they do do the home secretary agree that the way to protect vulnerable child be to take action and implement the recommendation as quickly as possible we need to take forward the work on the inquiry with victim and survivor on continue basis would also highlight that there be some area that will need to go well beyond the independent inquiry such as the way in which online abuse and online grooming be accelerate gang and organised network be operate online and then draw young people offline for physical abuse as well as for share terrible image that be massive and grow crime and be really worried about it we be go to need much strong action whether it be through social medium company take more responsibility or have strong measure online we will need more action alexis jay independent inquiry into child sexual abuse have not be fully implement the inquiry recommend legislate to force tech firm to take strong action on online abuse material since then this house have pass the online safety act and ofcom set out its implementation plan last october but how can the government ensure that tech company take strong action on online abuse the hon gentleman be right to refer to the online safety act which take long to come into force than would have wish but it be now be implement that mean new measure will come into place in the spring with further measure and requirement in the summer we will also come forward with further measure on online exploitation and abuse and we will set they out in due course warmly welcome the home secretary statement and look forward to the timeline she will present for implement the recommendation in her statement she mention support and belief for victim and survivor one of the big supportive action she could take be to consider prevent cse rapist from see their child bear from these crime once they be convict as they use access to their child to continue their abuse and to re victimise the girl whose life they have already ruin once my hon friend make really important point this can be the most appalling way of continue this abuse as that be what it be with abuser use the court and other institution effectively to continue their abuse and exploitation we will be take action in this area and we will be put forward more measure both the safeguarding minister and the victims minister my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones can have further discussion with she about that in telford we see the systematic abuse of so many child who be rap and we see cover up by the police and council official yet not single member of the police force or single council official in telford or anywhere else in the country have go to jail will the secretary of state use her power to set up specialist unit within the national crime agency as my hon friend the member for west suffolk nick timothy say to look at this and ensure that some of those who cover up these crime be hold to account do think there need to be strong action on accountability so think the right hon gentleman make serious point about these issue across public service but one of the most effective way to do that be by strengthen the legal framework include the legal requirement on those who be responsible through have duty to report and make it clear that block and cover up be an offence where there be exist power we must ensure that they be properly use and strengthen gently remind the right hon gentleman that he be minister include an education minister over many year when people be call for strengthening of the law hope he will now support that strengthening of the law even though he do not at the time warmly welcome the measure that the home secretary have set out to pursue perpetrator and to challenge the culture of cover up and also welcome her strong statement that nobody should resist the urge to report child rape for fear of be label racist do she share my contempt for those who weaponise the suffering of victim particularly through online disinformation to pursue their own hateful agenda the attack by elon musk on the safeguarding minister in the last few day cross line for so deactivate my account early at what point do the continue presence of government departments on that platform legitimise space that be now not only poisonous but dangerous my hon friend be right that this have to be about show respect for victim and survivor it can not be about perpetuate misinformation online for the sake of click and audience we have responsibility to make practical change and hope we can stick to this house core tradition of sit opposite each other across the dispatch boxes and across the chamber to talk about what really matter to our constituent rather than simply chase headline online welcome the measure that the home secretary have announce today on mandatory reporting on groom be an aggravating factor and on the well use of datum but the fact remain that there be still widespread suspicion that there have be cover up because of the nature of these crime and those who perpetrate they do she agree that there be need for national inquiry because it have be see that the problem be wide than be originally envisage because there have be disgraceful cover up by public body and because there be allegation that the cps have role in ensure that people be not prosecute rather than hide behind the rhetoric that this be far right demand do she not accept that this would be reasonable response from government who say they want to deal with the problem and restore public confidence the very reason why and many of we call for an independent inquiry many year ago be because of the deep concern about the scale of the hide abuse and about the total failure of institution to respond there be concern about information be hide and about authority not take the action that be need that be why we call for an inquiry in the first place and it be why the previous government invest over million in that inquiry over seven year the inquiry rightly include two year investigation into the grooming gang and organise child exploitation but further work need to be do in local area have mention telford and oldham be now take forward that work as well ultimately this all go back to the need for police investigation the police be the one who have the power to get to the truth about the perpetrator who be commit crime to gather the evidence to get they before court and to get they behind bar over half million child be sexually abuse each year and there be about as many perpetrator yet some opposition members want to focus only on few rather than the big case we have hear about involve tv presenter the catholic church and other this be something we have to take seriously rather than exploit it to chase headline or look for future funder for political party we be take action lead by two formidable woman who will not let any abuser get away with exploit woman man or child anywhere particularly online the science innovation and technology committee will tomorrow begin an inquiry into algorithm can the home secretary reassure the house that action be the priority for this government not further year of talk action be what survivor need my hon friend be right that we need action and we need to see progress and change further area will need investigation and inquiry for example welcome the select committee inquiry she mention particularly the investigation into online abuse and exploitation as well as the expansion of online abuse be deeply concerned about the grow number of young people who be be draw into abuse and especially abuse between teenager that type of exploitation and harm of young people be extremely serious and it be escalate call dr caroline johnson to ask the final question the house have agree this afternoon that cultural sensitivity should not get in the way of police investigation however it would appear that they have and they perhaps still be and that victim have be let down and that current victim might be be fail even today there be specific problem with gang of organise man who be systematically rap and abuse young child within that group there be an over representation of man of pakistani heritage we need to understand why but piecemeal investigation town by town will not help we to do that will not serve the interest of victim by ensure they get the justice they deserve and will not prevent future case the hon lady rightly raise an important point that be first raise as part of the jay inquiry more than year ago and then by the casey inquiry and she be right that we need to see action despite those issue have be raise over decade ago in many area not just groom gang and exploitation but other area of child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse there have still not be any action take to change thing which be why we have to make sure that action be take we have to look at the recommendation make include in the two year strand that be part of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and we have to work with the victim and survivor panel to identify further area for investigation we have to improve ethnicity datum which be not adequate we publish what we have in november but it be not strong enough that kind of datum can inform the kind of investigation that need to take place we need to ensure that we look into child abuse wherever it be to be find across the country in whatever institution or community crime be crime and child need protect wherever they be thank the home secretary for her statement apology to hon member who do not get in but we have two further item of business backbench business frozen russian assets ukraine it be the intention to run each of the backbench business debate for just an hour and half give the time we be leave with beg to move that this house recognise the horror of russia renew illegal invasion of ukraine far recognise the necessity of ukrainian victory over russia agree that the united kingdom must do all it can to support ukraine in its fight against russian aggression acknowledge that there be approximately billion of russian asset freeze in the and eu and call on the government to investigate way that these frozen asset could be legally seize and use to fund the war effort in ukraine and to report back to the house with its finding thank the backbench business committee for grant time for the debate and colleague from across the house for come together to debate this important motion sasha be and from mariupol he be cook outside with his mother because their apartment have be bomb when they be shell some shrapnel go into sasha eye imperille his eyesight luckily they manage to get to first aid station where the shrapnel be remove and thankfully his eyesight be save shortly after they be capture by russian force and take to filtration camp where they be go over there and you go over not even allow to say goodbye to each other we have echo of that in our european history sasha be take to further location in occupy ukraine he be tell that his mother do not want he anymore and that he would be send to live with good russian family sasha be braver cleverer and more tenacious than and he manage to get hold of mobile phone he ring his grandmother and tell she where he be through an extraordinary series of event and organisation his grandmother manage to get he out of that situation and he now live with she sasha do not know if his mum be dead or alive and he be still look for she extraordinarily sasha be one of the lucky one he escape his abduction his russification and indoctrination and be sever forever from his birth family and be the term that be use with russian family we can not say the same for at least other ukrainian child the ukrainian government have verify and document case of ukrainian child be take from ukraine place with russian family and tell to forget ukraine and to love russia that be one of the small estimate the united nations think ukrainian child have be abduct and send to russia have experience war so think have good handle on the full range of human behaviour but extraordinarily there be russian official who be boast about the number of ukrainian child they have abduct and place with russian family estimate range from to crime like that do not go unnoticed in the international criminal court issue arrest warrant for vladimir putin and maria lvova belova who have possibly the most orwellian job title child right commissioner for the president of the russian federation for the war crime of unlawful abduction deportation and transfer of child from ukraine to russia worse still that crime amount to genocide because the abduction of child and their indoctrination into another culture be consider genocide there be echo here of europe past never again they say never again congratulate the hon gentleman on secure today important debate it have be nearly three year since putin try to illegally invade the whole of ukraine lead to devastating loss of life displacement and destruction we must of course ensure that ukraine have all the support it need but surely it should not just be my slough constituent and uk taxpayer contribute give that russia and putin be no long listen to the international community and show no sign of stop be it not time for our government to use frozen russian asset to ensure that putin pay directly for the damage that he be inflict on the ukrainian people thank the chair of the defence committee on which have the honour of serve he be of course right and that be why we have come here today as make progress with my speech will set out some of the argument never again leave we with moral question how do we answer the genocidal abduction of child on european soil it also leave we with strategic question to which will now turn thank the hon gentleman for secure the debate and for the wonderful way that he have start his speech it be important to recognise that the abduction of child from ukraine from crimea and the donbas do not start in it start in it have be go on for year the figure that he give be broadly correct think from meeting that have have with crimea platform and other in ukraine but the second world war to which he allude last only six year the camp exist for only three year and we be year into this child abduction international humanitarian law effectively start with nuremburg do he agree that we will need to take much long and deep look at reset international law post the ukraine war agree this be war crime of stupendous scale breadth and width there be question of not only justice but get those child back to their family in ukraine that be part of the work that we all must do once the war be over with russia defeat and ukraine victorious commend the hon gentleman for bring the debate forward be happy to be signatory to the request for it to the backbench business committee do he agree that the ongoing humanitarian crisis in ukraine since the start of the war have escalate with thousand injure and kill million flee for well life elsewhere some such family be work and live in my constituency of strangford shortage of medical supply hospital overwhelmed and an energy and food crisis the thrust of the debate be that freeze russian asset do not work they have to be seize quite agree in tunbridge wells have be hearten by the number of family who have take in ukrainian refugee we also have ukrainian school to continue the important work of enshrine and protect ukrainian culture because when people commit genocide one of the thing they do be destroy the culture of their enemy move on to the strategic question can not state plainly enough that ukraine be fight for we ukraine be fight for the united kingdom and for the security of europe putin will not stop if he succeed in ukraine he seek to recreate russian empire or at least sphere of influence the territory of which be currently cover by country that wish to remain free country hasten to add that be our ally by treaty speak of lithuania latvia estonia and poland it be important that we look to the future in only two week president elect trump will be inaugurate we do not know how he will respond we do not know what he will do he may not know himself what he will do but we know that he feel differently about ukraine about the security of europe and about russia why be that important the united kingdom should be proud of the leadership role that we have play over ukraine from the first next generation light anti tank weapon to the billion and then some that we give every year we have work with ally throughout in total billion of support security humanitarian and financial have be give to ukraine of that billion have come from the us so we see immediately that the us as so often in international affair be totally indispensable the security of europe rest upon american support if that support be withdraw we have problem luckily for we we have option when the renew invasion in february be inflict upon ukraine we move swiftly with ally to freeze russian asset there be some billion of russian state asset in country some billion of those asset be in euroclear in belgium and there be probably more than billion worth of asset in the united kingdom the minister will have well idea than perhaps he can undertake to update the house on the exact scale of russian asset currently hold in uk institution in june last year the agree that we would use the interest from those asset to support ukraine and this house pass the enable legislation cross party just before christmas it amount to about billion with which we will support ukraine very welcome first step do my hon friend agree that the uk work shoulder to shoulder with our european ally must lead the way in confiscate and repurpose frozen russian asset for ukraine by ensure that ukraine have every financial and military resource that it need we can not only help the ukrainians to reclaim their country but send powerful message that britain stand unwavere in the defence of freedom and democracy against russian aggression my hon friend be right it be about not just action that lead to practical outcome but the signal that we send to our geopolitical opponent be listen carefully to what the hon gentleman have to say and agree with much of it include that russia must pay for what it have do in term of support ukraine in its war and the reconstruction to come whatever that look like however do he share my concern that be we to act unilaterally or indeed with other we may encourage the attractiveness of other reserve currency and system in particular china and that capital among the trillion or so globally invest may find its way to beijing rather than currently safe destination in the western world can answer the right hon gentleman directly be not advocate that we move unilaterally do not think that would be good idea if one country be to move that allow capital flight to other country the problem with the chinese currency be that it be not fully convertible it be not an international currency in which people like to keep lot of their reserve that be why be advocate for the as whole to move look at the currency of the the dollar sterling the billion of these asset be denominate in euro and the yen these be the major reserve currency of the world if the country move together think we will be safe the right hon gentleman broad point be about the financial stability of international market that be an important point but any potential small amount of financial instability create by the country move together would be minuscule compare with the financial instability of ukraine lose the war if we want to shift the dial on ukraine especially in the face of potential drawdown in us support we need to go far and fast and seize the billion of frozen asset and send they to ukraine there be clear legal pathway for do so the international law doctrine of state countermeasure say that state can take countermeasure against other state if there have be grievous violation of international law such as the genocidal abduction of child hear the question from the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison on co ordinate action while no nation have yet move fully to seize russian state asset canada and the us have enact legislation to permit they to do so do the hon member agree that legislation be an important step forward and that the threat of immediately seize billion of immobilise asset be tool that would add pressure on russia already wan economy it be as if give the hon member copy of my speech because will come to that in my next paragraph in april the us pass the repo act which enable the us to seize frozen russian asset and give they to ukraine for she and indeed our defence what be more it become clear over the past month that the us have be quietly push its ally include we one assume to take the step to investigate how to seize those asset and send they to ukraine perhaps the minister could feed back to the house what conversation have be have with the us state department what it have ask we to do and how we have respond as my hon friend ask the minister question let highlight something hope this government will have well record on seize asset than the previous one the former deputy prime minister dominic raab suggest that sutton place in my woke constituency should be sell to benefit ukraine or to house ukrainian refugee it be sit idle despite the fact that it have be sanction as it be own by usmanov do my hon friend agree that the new government need to do much well and sell asset like sutton place to benefit ukraine order intervention have be far too long point out at the beginning that only minute will be allow for the debate perhaps the member in charge will consider conclude his remark shortly be come to conclusion madam deputy speaker what we ask for in the motion be simple it be not to seize the asset although we think the time for that have come and it be not to act unilaterally as the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison ask about we ask the government to investigate with ally how we can go about seize the asset legally and then to report back to the house on those finding if the government agree and will do that perhaps the minister could let we know the timeline this be an issue of unity we this house and this country have be unite in our support for ukraine and in our opposition to russia aggression in the spirit of the unity that we have show on ukraine and russia we humbly beseech the government to investigate with ally how they can go about seize the asset legally we have remain united on ukraine throughout and we have show exceptional leadership now be the time to show that leadership again rise order there will be an immediate five minute time limit congratulate the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin on secure the debate there be bit of disease in british politic of reach back to the second world war to make point but when we walk into this chamber we walk through an archway of bomb damage and when we hear the echo of history we should listen to they the hon member make that point eloquently in sense it be frustrating that we be even debate whether to do what be in the motion but it be good that we be have the debate because the fact that we care about the rule of law and the international order be what separate we from putin and his ally we have to prove to putin and his ally that our belief in those thing be not weakness and we have to prove that we have the determination to defend our value in this year which mark the anniversary of the defeat of fascist aggression in europe we have to constantly remember that the freedom we enjoy be win through strength and sacrifice and that freedom come at cost the hon member for tunbridge wells list the enormous price that ukraine be pay in lose citizen lose child and lose infrastructure for defend that freedom the world have say clearly that putin have to pay the price for that the un general assembly have say that russia must make reparation for the injury include any damage cause by such act this be debate about balance sheet and bank account but put monetary value on the cost of this war be at good partial accounting do my hon friend agree that vladimir putin ally see britain as soft touch and good place to put their money and investment whether ill get gain or legal be it not now time under new government for we to show that this have change this government will take it seriously and will take more rigorous approach than the previous government absolutely as well as listen to the echo of deep history we have to learn lesson from our more recent failure meet soldier call dimitri in ward for wounded soldier in kyiv he be strengthen his stump for the day when he could have prosthetic fit to both his now miss leg ask what his hope for the future be think he would say holiday get job or spending time with his family he say that it be live life without shame listen to he feel ashamed because as proud as we all be of the support we have give ukraine it have not be enough we know one thing in this debate the money that putin owe be many time great than the money that have be seize the legal objection to transfer the fund in whole to ukraine seem to be that under the principle of the use of countermeasure by state the measure must first induce change in policy from the target and secondly be reversible on the first seize the asset do not just induce the change in policy it deliver the change in policy it pay the reparation in part on it be reversible we can give the kremlin credit note for the money pay and say it have be take off the total with the time have leave to speak want to ask the minister two direct question but these be really question for all western nation that hold russian state asset but be hesitant about send they in full to ukraine first be there any conceivable situation in which we and our international partner would unfreeze the asset we hold and return they to russia if putin have not deliver the reparation he be bind to pay secondly be there any conceivable situation in which putin would voluntarily give up those reparation if we be honest the answer to both those question have to be no rather than make policy on an imaginary future that will not come and hold the fund in perpetuity we should use they now in full in whole when ukraine need they most if we be hang up on the legal argument as say we should call in loan and give the kremlin credit note the irony of the debate be that we be at risk of our commitment to the international order prevent we from enforce it the irony be that putin have step outside that international order be demand its protection we need to listen to the echo of history as we enter this chamber and ensure that ukraine have everything it need to fight and win this war congratulate the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin on secure the debate be sad that it have be reduce from three hour to an hour and half because it be an important debate and hope that the minister have time to answer some of the question in reality we be in peculiar position do not blame this government because the previous government be in the same position whereby we be as the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall just say trap ourselves in the same argument that be mean to release we to get after those who have do egregious harm to other through an illegal invasion of another territory that be clear and it be why we should be permit at this stage where necessary to seize those frozen asset it be very simple there be not time to go through all the legal argument but there be good reason why we would be able to act in that way and would be happy to write to the minister about they first instead of claim that international law prohibit we from do those thing it be important to remember that the basis of international law be pretty fluid because it be hugely influence by the politic of the day otherwise we would still be trap in what happen in even though thing have move on that be another point the british government should not use those argument against action they should lead on make the necessary change where possible my main point be that when it come to freeze and sequester asset there be good point at the end of it all hopefully we will soon face an end to this war and the brutality execution murder and ghastly damage that russia have inflict on ukraine ultimately there must be reparation by the country that invade ukraine which be russia the trouble be we know very well that if we impose those reparation russia will never pay any of they so the only hope we have be to seize state and oligarch asset and to say that they can be hold in payment of the necessary reparation and will be release as reparation be pay in accordance with what the un say at the end of the war that be one way of use frozen asset seize they and say you will get these back but only when you have stand up and do what you ve be tell to do after this aggressive war if member look carefully they will see that we be already consider take the money earn from asset in bank that set of asset and their income can not be separate at the moment we be talk of separate the income from the asset as if there be some fundamental difference between who own what while the state have an asset bank it also own the money earn from it we can not just say that we might do one but not the other if we seize what be earn we should recognise that that allow we also to seize the asset that be earn that money in the bank there be no reason why we should not pursue that and would be grateful if the minister respond on that point in due course do not believe that there be in international law any obligation or block on do any of this these argument be be have at the moment in various court case by the way we be not talk about the uk unilaterally seize asset canada which have already be mention and the us have already pass legislation to give they permission to seize those asset the anglosphere be begin to come together on this one there be foot drag in germany and france and very much in belgium we know why belgium have huge number of russian asset and seem to be somewhat trouble by the idea of take they over say this in cross party spirit surely now be the chance for the united kingdom government my government because they be elect to take the lead in argue now for we to use these asset against future reparation and mend what have go on so appallingly in ukraine urge the government to step up take that lead and give the rest of the developed world the chance to get that money into the place where it can do the most good across the house we agree that we must show putin that we have the resolve and resource to defeat he if we do not great power war more terrible that we can imagine will come century ago politician on these benches fail and what follow be the most destructive war in the history of humankind stop that horror be repeat depend on we win at war economic as the motion rightly identify war economic be simple whichever side can command great resource and convert they into fighting force will win win single battle mean nothing if the other side can keep throw in resource to win the next one amateur talk tactic professional talk logistic win at war economic mean do three thing first we must limit russia earning and output secondly we must limit russia ability to convert its earning into fighting force and thirdly we must gain and convert our own resource into fighting force seize the billion will help with the third point only if we convert those resource into fighting force first on limit russia output and earning russia earning from oil be still far too high billion year ural oil be trade at above the price cap russia be circumvent that by pad out cost for its shadow fleet in attestation document maximilian hess the esteemed foreign policy expert have show that we can strengthen our price cap by make london insurance for foreign port dependent on the proper verification of cost in attestation document be pleased that the office of financial sanctions agree to look into that when it give evidence to the treasury committee secondly we must stop russia convert its output into munition and material too many of our western component be find their way to russian frontline thirdly we must do more to convert the resource that we need into fighting force that be where our industrial defence strategy come in seize the billion can help with that as an economist should make clear to the house that seize those asset would not damage our economy or reduce financial stability however we must be clear on the how and the why on the how we can not seize those asset unilaterally we hold only about of they here while around two third be hold in europe we must convince our european ally to do as the canadians and americans have do in seize those asset on the why seized asset be useful only if we convert they into defence production the bit by bit approach that have characterise support to ukraine must end large and sustained increase be need putin want to rebuild great russia and to swallow his neighbour whole he will attempt to take more of europe defeat he mean defeat our own complacency the history of nation be history of war that history change only when the calculation of peace change through military strength through sacrosanct border and through democracy if we do not show that we have the resolve and resource to defeat putin we will make the same mistake that member make from these benches almost century ago one of our nation great prime ministers stand outside this chamber his hand atop his hip he warn member in this chamber and lament the time waste without prepare he speak of the year which the locust hath report november vol but he be ignore member on these benches be too complacent let we not be complacent member on these benches fail let we not fail member on these benches see ocean of blood spill by the youth of this nation let we not be the generation that see ocean of blood wash over this continent once more let we be the generation that keep the peace by show putin we have the resolve and resource to defeat he commend my hon friend the member for tunbridge wells mike martin for secure this vital debate there be many veteran in this chamber one in nine liberal democrat mps have serve in the armed force we know the price of freedom many of we have see it write on the grave of friend there be ten of thousand of ukrainians pay that bitter price right now which will all be in vain if we falter in our support with the looming trump administration that risk be real as the hon member for loughborough dr sandher have say if ukraine fail the consequence for our security would be catastrophic in the same way that our failure to show resolve on syria perhaps encourage putin to attack crimea our failure to show resolve on ukraine might encourage he to attack the baltic state test nato article and shatter the peace in europe that do not need to be our future if the seize the billion in russian asset we have the opportunity not only to keep ukraine in the fight but to win many be worried that seize that billion could undermine the global financial system be here to argue that that be not the case as lawrence summers the former us treasury secretary and many other have point out those fear be overblown because when those asset be freeze in the first place there be no observed consequence in financial market it have be make clear to financial market that the asset of sovereign aggressor be at risk when they be on deposit in country as they should be the risk that those asset will be seize should already have be substantially price in reduce the possibility of capital flight from negative surprise in any case where would that capital fly to if the country act together the pound dollar euro and yen amount to almost of the world reserve currency china be not an option because of capital control so there be no other viable reserve currency for country to deposit their reserve in as former hedge fund manager spend year invest professionally in financial market and can assure the house that investor will not be discourage from invest in safe and attractive currency for two simple reason fear and greed today the west spend billion annually on ukraine defence include billion from the us the billion in russian asset could fund the lot for three year or the us portion for six year if trump withdraw his support many think that russia resource be inexhaustible yet accord to the royal united services institute russia be go to run out of artillery ammunition and armoured vehicle next year it have already suffer casualty so russia capacity to wage war will fall dramatically in one year time but only if we can keep ukraine in the fight if ukraine can end this war on term that demonstrate that it be victorious the consequence for our security will be profound the threat from russia will be greatly diminish china will think twice about challenge liberal world order and the narrative of the decline of the free world and the rise of dictatorship will be decisively set back imagine what the free world could then achieve in the century as such urge the government to seize that billion in frozen russian asset to keep ukraine in the fight and salute the ukrainian soldier who be lay down their life not only for their country freedom but for our freedom too thank the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin for secure this debate speak today as the constituency member of parliament for many of the asset we be discuss it be easy to throw around the many billion of russian own wealth across the country for that reason when reference the luxurious wealth of putin crony all of my calculation today be go to be in the unit of storm shadow missile each of which cost these be the weapon of war that we talk about when we discuss fund the conflict in ukraine in total storm shadows worth of russian wealth be sanction with profit from that wealth use to repay the extraordinary revenue acceleration fund the uk support of ukraine to put that in perspective the uk total stock of storm shadows be estimate in to sit between and in westminster alone accord to research by transparency international storm shadows worth of property be own by russians accuse of corruption or with link to the kremlin property that stretch from belgravia to st james and st john wood indeed the most valuable home in the uk hanover lodge be sell last year for storm shadows by andrey goncharenko former gazprom executive with tie to the kremlin great deal of that property be own by or connect to sanction individual include former deputy prime ministers igor shuvalov and vladimir potanin the existence of this property be not just an economic issue its impact also reach into the very heart of our community our building and neighbourhood be weaken when they be use for profit rather than purpose strong community be one in which neighbour can be the one who look after your kid when you have job interview it be those community that be undermine when we let tower of vacant investment property propagate and turn blind eye to foreign wealth empty out british home most recently these community have open their arm to hundred of thousand of ukrainians flee from putin illegal invasion be the constituency member for number of those refugee and it be think of they that give the overwhelming majority of we in this house the resolve to use every tool at our disposal that bring we to today topic the seizure of sanctioned asset as we hear early the significance of this step and the precedent it would set should not escape we as legislator the first ever permanent seizure of frozen asset occur only last year when the national crime agency confiscate the asset of petr aven for suspect evasion of sanction to set out an intentional policy of seize those asset would be bold step and one that would doubtless lead to legal challenge however it must be worth we consider every option available for sanctioned asset particularly when there be clear argument that it would be justify to use they in support the ukrainian people putin invasion of ukraine be in complete contravention of international law and violate the sovereignty and self determination of the ukrainian people furthermore as have be confirm by the un independent international commission of inquiry on ukraine it have enable string of other war crime include indiscriminate attack violation of personal integrity include execution torture and ill treatment and sexual and gender base violence as be make clear during the application of the original sanction the sanctioned individual be play direct part in this war they range from propagandist spread disinformation about the conflict to garner public support domestically and across the globe to industrialist manufacture the chemical use in russian weapon and military and security personnel directly contribute to the invasion when the war in ukraine be over question will remain about what we do with the storm shadows of sanction wealth belong to those who fund champion and even fight in putin illegal invasion we must take this opportunity to consider what sort of country we want to be when it come to that dirty money and to ensure that we do not let our economy be complicit in the force that fund evil across the world debate such as this about the horror now happen in ukraine be always very important and very difficult to speak in very much appreciate listen to some of the harrowing story to remind myself just what the ukrainians be experience but also why all of we must push back putin war machine be most proud of the leadership that our country have show over the past few year in the international response to support the ukrainians to stand up against putin key part of that be bring together the international community to multilaterally not unilaterally support the ukrainians in their plight early in this conflict we see the weaponisation of oil and gas price we see and continue to see hybrid warfare which have be go on for some time very much support at every stage the full fat embargo of russian oil and gas indeed this house strongly support the sanction which have be an important part of our support for the ukrainians as tempting as this motion be and it be very tempting when we read it must say that like member on both side of the house be cautious and have some concern and reservation about it it be important to consider the impact on the international financial order and the rule of law what differentiate we from putin and the russian state be that we do consider and debate this we have this place where we can consider the rule base order putin think that make we weak but he be wrong it make we strong and it be what we stand for and what we believe in if we be to look at seize asset there be two important consideration first this focus on state asset as oppose to those of individual and company as there be currently no judicial process for individual and company who have have their asset frozen and to go ahead with seize those asset be much big step member have mention individual and company as well as the state but the focus have to be specifically on russian state asset for which the legal framework be strong secondly as with how we lead from the beginning of the conflict there have to be multilateral approach this have to be link through the and our partner in europe it have to be do together in unison and we have history of do that say to the minister that be very proud of how we have do that if we be to do this we must do it multilaterally we also need to look at these asset be use for military use as oppose to just general economic support my understanding be that the interest money that have now be free up have be restrict from use for military intervention and this also need to be consider as part of the process finally we also need to ensure that our current sanction be effective just before christmas mention my concern about the oil and gas embargo particularly the idea that crude oil derivative could be find their way into the uk economy despite the embargo be grateful to the minister for respond to some of my specific question on that but hope he will look carefully at the effectiveness of the proof of origin under the rule of origin particularly when it come to petrochemical derivative such as plastic and other product that can be manufacture through the use of russian oil and gas we must ensure that in our economy our oil and gas embargo of russia be as effective as possible before we even start look at the next measure to take too thank the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin for secure this important debate this issue matter deeply to my constituent kensington and bayswater be home to thriving ukrainian community and be hub for ukrainian institution from the embassy and the consulate to the social club and the school but in kensington regrettably we be also at the epicentre of britain historical addiction to corrupt kleptocrat wealth we be in close competition with my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake in that regard in the wake of putin full scale invasion of ukraine in february co found the kensington against dirty money campaign alongside local community campaigner to expose the vast sum of illicit capital hide in luxury property in our community as have be say that dirty money undermine democracy both at home and abroad and for too long kleptocrat have be able to sidestep the rule and hoard illicit wealth through opaque corporate structure thank my hon friend the member for tunbridge wells mike martin so much for secure this debate do the hon member agree that if the west fail to act decisively in seize russian asset that simply signal to authoritarian regime worldwide that aggression and the violation of international law come with little consequence which will destabilise the global order and increase the likelihood of future conflict the hon member be absolutely right there be thing the uk can do to be the trailblazer and there be thing we need to do in partnership with our international partner and shortly will move on to how think we can do more on the asset specifically also want to take the opportunity to welcome the personal and relentless campaign by the foreign secretary and the minister in relation to sanction include the recent action on the shadow fleet however in order for those measure to be fully effective we must ensure that sanction can not be evade and there be still loophole that need to be close my hon friend the minister will know that have be follow closely the progress of our overseas territory and crown dependency in finally follow the will of parliament by establish public register of company ownership allow we to follow the money and detect where sanction evasion may be take place for example in place such as the british virgin islands it also mean that we need to consider incorporate trust own property into our register of overseas entity ensure that trust can not be use to conceal property that could be subject to sanction as we have say our resident deserve well than live in these community hollow out by wealth and build on corruption where my constituent be suffer at the sharp end of london housing crisis in the next door constituency of my hon friend the member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman there be the case of chelsea football club over two year ago roman abramovich be force to sell the club with approximately billion pledge to humanitarian programme for victim of the war yet not single penny of that money have be spend those chelsea fund amount to five time the uk total humanitarian assistance to ukraine since and they remain stuck in an escrow account that be travesty give that release those fund would not cost the british taxpayer penny it would save countless life at time when million people require urgent assistance in eastern ukraine alone and humanitarian agency face shortfall of billion welcome the uk leadership in the on secure the additional billion of support to ukraine use the profit from the holding of immobilised russian sovereign asset with over billion come from the uk share we have lead on sanction we have lead on freeze asset and we have lead on mobilise the interest on asset and now believe it be time for the uk to lead coalition of willing nation to take decisive action to seize those sovereign asset in full invite the hon member to recognise that there be an international precedent for the seizure of russian asset back in follow the iraqi invasion of kuwait the us the uk and france transfer iraqi asset to kuwait to directly correspond with reparation to kuwait do he agree that should be the case with russian asset agree the moral and legal rationale for seize these asset be clear the total cost of russia destruction of ukraine have already far exceed the total frozen state asset it be inconceivable that russia will ever pay for the irreparable harm it have cause ukraine seize these asset would not only increase ukraine capacity to resist further destruction but help its leader rebuild the country it would be downpayment on the reparation russia will almost certainly be legally liable for and will make it face the full consequence of its action now britain leadership on ukraine from military support to homes for ukraine to sanction have be exemplary and cross party but there be always more to do so ask the minister to address my point about make our sanction more effective by tackle evasion close the loophole in our property register release the chelsea fund and mobilise the international coalition to seize russian state asset so that we can support our friend on the frontline in ukraine right now that bring we to the front bench contributor start with james maccleary start by thank my hon friend the member for tunbridge wells mike martin for secure this valuable and important debate russia illegal war in ukraine be not just an assault on one nation it be direct challenge to the value that unite europe democracy sovereignty and the rule of law europe must respond with strength and unity and the uk have unique role to play in lead the charge russia malign influence extend far beyond ukraine from interference in democratic election across europe to spread disinformation the kremlin have show its commitment to undermine the democratic value that bind our continent this be not just ukraine fight it be fight for the integrity of all our democracy our defence sector be among the large in europe and our international influence remain significant when meet european colleague one message be clear they want the uk to lead this be moment for the uk to step up and demonstrate the leadership that have long define our place in europe even though we be for now outside the european union seize frozen russian asset and repurpose they be one of the most effective way to support ukraine these fund be not just financial resource they be symbol of aggression that must become instrument of justice putin grasp on power depend on corruption and control by seize and repurpose these asset we can weaken his grip our ally have show the way canada amend its special economic measures act to allow the seizure of russian asset for grave breach of international peace and the united states pass the repo rebuild economic prosperity and opportunity for ukrainians act to transfer russian sovereign asset directly to ukraine these step provide clear and workable model for the uk and europe to adopt agree on the legal precedent and it would be interesting to hear the minister comment on that we have hear about the iraq precedent the legal precedent be there do the hon gentleman agree that crucially russia have step outside the international norm and that to protect the international rule base system we must show that there be consequence it be imperative that we take action to show that matter thank the hon member for his intervention it be as if have give he copy of my speech be about to come on to that stop the russian assault on ukraine be part of wide struggle for the future of democracy and liberty in europe and around the world russian ruler vladimir putin have make this war an existential one stake the future of his regime on it we must be in no doubt that current and wannabe dictator be watch closely to see how european power respond to russia challenge any wavering in our support for ukraine could easily be interpret as green light to other to launch grab for coveted territory in short the basis of the liberal world order be at stake and britain have duty to protect that order which we do so much to create with the loom return of donald trump to the white house the stake for europe could not be high the future of us support for ukraine be uncertain and europe must be prepared to step up this be wake up call for the uk we must lead within europe and ensure that brave ukrainians receive the robust support that they need from we beyond repurpose russian asset we must also address the systemic failure that have allow dirty money to flood into our economy the uk have long be destination of choice for russian wealth much of it funnel through loophole in economic crime legislation it be time to properly resource the national crime agency close these loophole and make it clear that kleptocrat be no long welcome here member who like be student of russian and east european history will be familiar with the word holodomor there have be lot of reference to history and the lesson that we should take from it for those who be not familiar with the word we would simply call it the ukrainian famine in and uncounted million of ukrainians starve to death as direct result of policy prosecute by another dictator in the kremlin joseph stalin genuinely hope that those in this chamber in the future will not look back on we and say that we could have do more to stop another great crime against the ukrainian people the liberal democrats have be clear that this be about more than military aid it be about hold russia accountable and strengthen ukraine defence ukraine fight be our fight by take action now the uk can reaffirm that aggression will never be reward that europe will always stand firm in defence of freedom and that britain remain at the heart of the continent security and value call shadow minister gareth davies congratulate the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin on secure this debate and give an incredibly move speech in which he tell the story of sasha and of course other child what be happen in ukraine be absolutely heartbreaking and he be right to raise those concern in the house today last week many people start just as we start every new year with hope optimism and determination that this year will be well than the last it be therefore right that our first debate this year be about our united resolve to ensure that ukraine can continue to oppose russian aggression and about way that we in this country can continue to support our friend and ally in this task we have hear number of excellent speech from across the house which have be both inform and incredibly move for day now ukrainian man woman and child have be suffer the consequence of the most recent stage of war that they do not ask for and do not start and that continue to claim the life of so many of their friend family and fellow countryman we conservative members be proud of our record of support for the people of ukraine in government we provide over billion in military humanitarian and economic support because of this the united kingdom have rightly take its place as global leader in defend ukraine the uk be first mover in provide vital aid from helmet and body armour to yes storm shadow missile and challenger battle tank we create safe route for those flee the conflict through the ukrainian family scheme and the homes for ukraine scheme in which many member participate we establish operation interflex which have train over ukrainian recruit on british soil since the illegal invasion in and we impose the large and most severe set of sanction russia have ever see with individual country and group sanction this ensure that we be target not just the sector of strategic significance to the russian government and that those in and around the kremlin be leave with nowhere to hide no matter where they be base just as president putin have so far sacrifice the life of hundred of thousand of his countryman on the altar of his personal imperial ambition he seem determined to destroy the future prosperity of the russian people as my right hon friend the member for south west wiltshire dr murrison say putin must be make to pay for his action and number of other member also make that clear ukraine must continue to be support in its fight against putin war machine so we welcome the fact that this government be continue much of the vital work that we start to strengthen the ukrainian response however british support for ukraine be underpin by our willingness and that of our nato ally to also invest in our own defence that be why hope that the government will keep to their pre election pledge of increase defence spending in this country to of gdp as have say before be pleased that there be such clear consensus on support for ukraine in this house on military support humanitarian aid and indeed sanction where the government take responsible and sensible further step the official opposition will of course support they the last conservative government be one of the most vocal proponent of repurpose frozen russian asset and we drive our and european ally to coalesce around the most ambitious solution the announcement by the treasury on october that the uk would contribute billion to the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan to ukraine scheme represent progress on that journey and we very much welcome that but we should never stop look for innovative way to legally mobilise frozen sovereign asset it would therefore be good to hear from the minister what far step the government be explore give that the house be debate frozen russian asset it would be helpful for it to be provide with the most up to date information first can the minister update the house on the total value today of russian asset freeze by the and of the total asset freeze by uk jurisdiction secondly can he give some indication of the allocation of frozen asset by type there have be some discussion of that today but it would be helpful if the government give that breakdown to colleague today debate be focus on the seizure of frozen russian asset to assist ukraine the minister will be well aware this have be discuss at length today of the various legal consideration internationally and domestically relate to seizure give recent comment by the eu chief diplomat look forward to the minister clarify exactly what the government position be will he update the house on the government late discussion many have call for this today with our partner and other ally on seizure we should never allow ourselves to forget what this debate be ultimately all about many of we be return to this place after restful and perhaps indulgent christmas break but remind the house that the people of ukraine face very different christmas nothing illustrate that well than the fact that on christmas day as ukrainians gather together at st michael cathedral in kyiv pray for peace and victory in their prayer be cruelly interrupt by the pierce sound of air raid siren be in no doubt that the fight continue not just for those on the frontline but for all those who want their country to be free again can hear that the shadow minister be come to conclusion he be former investment banker so be curious to know his majesty opposition position on the seizure of frozen russian asset welcome the intervention our position in government and in opposition have be that we should do whatever it take to hold russia to account and to ensure that russia pay and we support ukraine have set out number of way financial and other in which we do that in government whether in government or in opposition we clearly have concern about legal obstacle which may or may not exist and it be right that we debate that today as well as the impact on market sentiment and investor confidence the issue be not as simple as some perhaps suggest there be number of factor but we should leave the option open and continue to explore all option when it come to support ukraine and hold russia to account and ensure that it pay rise will take one more intervention the key point be the one make by my hon friend the member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer about the distinction between private asset even such tainted one as be hold by oligarch and state asset the mover of this motion the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin will correct if be wrong but the billion worth of asset refer to in the motion be state asset in publication by the international institute for strategic studies in may last year no few than professor and other legal expert be unanimous in say that when it come to state asset there be no legal obstacle for seizure by third party state such as ourselves welcome the intervention by my right hon friend who be extremely diligent in his assessment of such matter will allow the minister who be actually in the government to provide their legal assessment of what may or may not be possible have set out our concern which we be happy to continue to debate and discuss as have say but it be right that throughout the house we continue in our support for ukraine it be right that we continue to discuss all the way we can support the ukrainians if there be way we should look at it thank the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin and other colleague across the house for table this important debate he make powerful speech start out with the horrific story of sasha it make think not only of similar story have hear directly but of the work do in community throughout the uk in maintain ukrainian culture and heritage the very culture heritage and language that putin be try to erase from the life of those child visit the centre in my constituency in cardiff just few week before christmas be grateful to all right hon and hon member for their contribution and their challenge they have make some important point and they can be assure that have listen to they all carefully it be important to emphasise that we have again see absolute unity in this house in our desire to support ukraine in its fight and that russia must pay those be the two key message come out of the debate for as all of we in the chamber know well russia assault on ukraine be an unprovoked premeditated and barbaric attack against sovereign democratic state as the shadow minister the hon member for grantham and bourne gareth davies say the christmas day attack reinforce the shocking and barbaric nature of what russia be do the uk and our international partner stand united we can not let aggressor like putin succeed will attempt to respond to many of the point that have be make which have all be important but will start by underline the magnitude of the uk response to putin invasion we have sanction more than individual and entity we have freeze more than billion worth of private asset under the russia sanction regime the shadow minister ask for some allocation by type and will certainly try to write to he with further detail on that alongside partner we have immobilise russian state asset in our jurisdiction too we have lead international shipping sanction that have disrupt the russian shadow fleet leave oil tanker idle across the globe unable to continue their trade we have ramp up action since july to include further tanker bar they from our port and deny they access to maritime service we have also sanction nine vessel involve in the shipping of liquefy natural gas from russia which have contribute to russia large producer suspending production all that be alongside measure target firm supply russia military industrial complex include chinese company send component for drone we have sanction cyber criminal and mercenary seek to destabilise african country not to mention russian troop for the appalling use of chemical weapon on the battlefield these carefully construct and wide range package be have significant impact on putin ability to finance his war erode russian oil revenue and support ukraine on the battlefield there be lot of talk about war economic from my hon friend the member for loughborough dr sandher but the fact be that russia be pay many time more for component that be often of poor quality and in much low quantity than it need by disrupt the russian oil industry we be put further pressure on the kremlin it have all contribute to russian economy that be in trouble with inflation at close to interest rate at and the rouble in decline putin have tell his population not to panic but disagreement between official and industrialist be increasingly vocal and that should serve as reminder not only to putin but to the wide world that there be high price to pay for assault the democracy sovereignty and territorial integrity of another nation many question have rightly be ask about enforcement since come into office have be clear as have the foreign secretary that we must have the necessary power and tool to implement and enforce our sanction regime effectively strengthen the system be top priority for this government and with the support of ministerial colleague have launch cross government review to examine how we can make it easy for business to comply with sanction but also bring the full force of the law to bear on those who do not we be work across government departments on that we have introduce new power for the office of trade sanctions implementation and for the department for transport in september last year the financial conduct authority fin starle bank almost million in relation to its financial sanction control and screening last month the national crime agency disrupt multibillion dollar russian money launder network with link to drug ransomware and espionage result in arrest it also seize more than million in cash and cryptocurrency the foreign secretary who be rightly reference in the debate have launch an important campaign on tackle illicit finance and kleptocracy include by deal with those who enable they we have make it clear that we will not hesitate to do what be necessary to clamp down on those who seek to evade our sanction we want to ensure that ukraine emerge from the war with modernised and inclusive economy that be resilient to russian threat that be as important as provide it with the crucial military support that it need we will therefore continue to work across range of donor platform to leverage private investment such as those at the ukraine recovery conference with the work of uk export finance and british international investment we have commit billion in military humanitarian and economic support to ukraine as be rightly reference we have often be the first mover when it have come to vital lethal assistance whether in respect of storm shadow missile challenger tank or of course the nlaw at the start of the war we have also recommit to billion year for as long as it take and sign long term bilateral security co operation agreement we be the first of country to do so as be rightly reference the chancellor have far announce that we will provide billion of additional support to ukraine as part of the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan to ukraine scheme thank hon member across the house for ensure the speedy passage of the legislation which pass its third reading unanimously to put that in place crucially those fund will be repay not by ukraine but by the extraordinary profit make on sanctioned russian state asset hold in the european union the fundamental question about what more we can do to use russian asset for the benefit of ukraine be at the heart of the debate the government and our partner have repeatedly affirm our position russia obligation under international law be clear it must pay for the damage it have cause to ukraine the era loan and our contribution will ensure that ukraine can receive the financial support that it need now it be right to focus on get that out the door because we urgently need to support ukraine now with the profit generate on sanctioned russian sovereign asset provide that reassure colleague throughout the house who have rightly ask lot of search and challenging question that we be commit to consider all possible lawful avenue by which russia can be make to meet its obligation to pay for the damage it be cause to ukraine we continue to work with ally to that end confirm that speak to foreign ministers from across europe on that and other crucial aspect of our support for ukraine just before the house rise in december we will continue to update parliament on the progress of that work however hope hon member will understand that it would not be appropriate to provide running commentary on discussion as ally have commit to keep those private include in respect of the specific sum of russian sovereign asset that be currently frozen absolutely accept what the minister say do he appreciate that with the possibility of president trump withdraw some if not all american aid to ukraine the substitution of substantial volume of financial support will become essential that be one reason behind our concern about the asset possibly be seize we be all concerned to get ukraine the support that it need and as quickly as possible it be wrong to speculate on what the future administration might choose to do let we remember that the package come through from the united states with strong bipartisan support and much of the support to ukraine even before the invasion come from the first trump administration let we be clear that there be support there and that there be unity across the atlantic on support for ukraine president trump have already say that he will continue with the payment and support may ask simple question we know from the financial assistance to ukraine bill that recently pass through the house that use the profit of asset will help to bring up to billion of support to ukraine previous legal commitment have be break which could not have be do before without prior legislation asset have never be separate from profit the minister do not have to answer the question now but will he go back to the foreign office with reminder that the asset be now leave available for seizure thank the right hon gentleman for his comment and hope that he will write the letter that he promise in the debate will read it with great interest he be extremely well informed on these matter and he know that have take keen interest in they over some time as say we will consider all lawful measure that we can possibly take to ensure that ukraine get the support it need will listen closely to his advice and indeed that of many other he would not expect to comment on any legal advice or technical advice under consideration be conscious of the time and the need to move to the next debate but genuinely want to thank all right hon and hon member hugely important point be make it be clear that there be unity in the house that we all want to get ukraine the support that it need and to get that there as quickly as possible be convinced that we be do everything we can on both side of the equation choke off russia ability to fund its war machine on the war economic side which be mention as well as get ukraine the support that it need we will continue to do that our support be ironclad and we have make that clear to president zelensky be with foreign minister sybiha number of time before christmas and he be absolutely clear that the uk support be critical and that it must continue we be glad to give he confirmation of our resolute support call mike martin to wind up thank you madam deputy speaker in the light of my overrunning speech early will not take up the full two minute allocate to so can give you back some time in congested parliamentary timetable will focus on two thing one be unity we have demonstrate that unity tonight throughout the house this be not about party politic this be about the moral and strategic interest of our country and our ally the other point be about leadership we have lead throughout on this conflict and this will be the next stage of that leadership question put and agree to resolve that this house recognise the horror of russia renew illegal invasion of ukraine far recognise the necessity of ukrainian victory over russia agree that the united kingdom must do all it can to support ukraine in its fight against russian aggression acknowledge that there be approximately billion of russian asset freeze in the and eu and call on the government to investigate way that these frozen asset could be legally seize and use to fund the war effort in ukraine and to report back to the house with its finding nhs backlog beg to move that this house have consider backlog in the nhs happy new year to you madam deputy speaker thank the backbench business committee for grant the debate apply for it because many member be interested in have the chance to discuss the problem and consult constructively on the potential solution for the nhs across the country it have end up be particularly timely debate give the secretary of state statement this afternoon which we broadly welcome the conservatives have push the nhs to break point leave legacy that include the big waiting list in history and healthcare system on the brink of collapse we have reach crisis point of backlog in the nhs system they affect not only those who be in dire need of medical care but the wonderful staff who work tirelessly in hospital gp surgery dental surgery pharmacy social care provider hospice and so on the situation in shropshire right now demonstrate the scale of the crisis the pressure be extreme on every aspect of healthcare and reflect the fact that in many case rural area be bear the brunt of national problem shropshire nhs have declare critical incident one of many across the country know as staff battle to cope with the huge winter spike of virus that mean that people can not visit their love one on regular basis and be require to wear mask when they go into the hospital that be just one example of how the system be fail to cope with the pressure understandably talk about nhs backlog centre on the million case wait for treatment but backlog also apply to the overflowing wait room and to the long line of ambulance queue outside they apply to the elderly people who have fall and wait many hour for an ambulance they apply to possible heart attack and stroke patient be tell to make their own way to hospital by west midlands ambulance service at certain time this year outside shrewsbury and telford hospital last sunday the late day we have datum for ambulance wait an average of three hour and minute to hand over patient across england on the same day patient have to spend more than an hour stick in an ambulance wait for space to become available at in my constituency our hospital face almost sewage leak which have an impact on its ability to provide service that be another pressure do my hon friend agree that the soon the government advise on what investment they will make to enhance service for our hospital across the uk the well have not put the crumble estate into my speech but my hon friend make very valid point because people can not work efficiently when they be deal with terrible hygiene and safety issue around they every single day commend the hon lady on bring forward this debate and on be so consistent and assiduous on this issue understand that she will come on to the lib dem manifesto which lot of we in this chamber whether lib dem or not can agree with in northern ireland we have the health and social care board which have be work on various strategy to reduce the backlog but the scale be truly significant do the hon lady agree that collectively england scotland wales and northern ireland should look at all the recommendation and bring they together so that this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland can benefit collectively the hon gentleman always make an excellent contribution to our debate he be right that we should look at good practice in northern ireland and the devolved nation as well as in england to get the right solution for the problem that we face hope colleague will forgive as will not take any more intervention because we be tight on time and lot of people want to speak we have reach point where patient suffer heart attack be be advise to find their own way to hospital how can that be acceptable once patient get into they be confront with the brutal reality of the backlog the reality mean that only half of patient arrive at in shropshire be see within four hour in november the statistic be shocking but individual people with serious problem suffer as result people such as my constituent with pericardial effusion who be deem fit to sit and leave in chair for more than hour before finally be take on blue light to receive the care she need staff in this situation be so overwork that the standard of care that they give be below what they would like to provide the patient dignity be compromise and staff be be drive from the service because they be unable to provide the care that they desperately want to until the government put plan in place to solve the workforce crisis there be risk that these scene will continue to happen in my local hospital trust alone total of hour of nursing shift go unfilled in the month to october liberal democrats be call for qualified clinician in every waiting room to ensure that anyone whose condition be deteriorate be treat more urgently we be also call on the government to publish accessible localise report of ambulance response time so that the delay that blight place such as north shropshire and other rural area can finally be address key reason for the emergency backlog be that every day around hospital bed be fill with patient who could leave if they have care package in place that be the equivalent of around hospital be out of action every day that be why liberal democrats have be bang the drum for social care without capacity in the care system bed will remain block will stay clogged and ambulance will continue queue outside hospital be pleased that the government have finally listen to our call for cross party talk to fix break care system and look forward to constructively engage with they throughout that process but we can not afford to wait three more year for this plan to be enact hope that the government will reconsider their timescale and get the review do as soon as possible so that the care sector can see the long term cross party commitment to reform that it so drastically need part of solve this issue be support preventive measure which stop people need secondary care in the first place recently visit the north shropshire charity energize and see the work of its elevate programme which work to improve fitness balance and co ordination in elderly and frail patient it have have some amazing achievement meet gentleman suffer from parkinson who have be fall five time week before he start his programme and who be now fall only once week of course it would be great if he do not fall at all but be sure everybody would agree that that be huge improvement it be estimate that for every invest in that programme be save so it be an area where we can really make difference to the crisis in the nhs few backlog have as much impact as those in cancer diagnosis and care nationally the target of of patient receive treatment within day have be miss every month since december at my local hospital trust few than two third of patient begin treatment within the day target improve this situation be integral to increase survival rate it be also key to restore patient faith in the nhs stop case like that of my constituent whose family feel completely fail by the nhs after he wait almost year for treatment after first present with bowel cancer symptom could the minister clarify whether the government remain committed to meet the cancer waiting time target this parliament as promise in their manifesto and whether those target will be include in their new national cancer strategy to achieve that improvement we need to address key workforce issue notably in radiology where there be shortfall of consultant across the country again in rural place such as shropshire it be recruitment and retention issue that have cause the sharp problem throughout it become normal in shropshire to wait month for cancer test and scan result with patient in my constituency only receive their result after their next scan be due to have happen be pleased to report that under new management this backlog be now in the process of be clear however that be happen due to overseas outsourcing which be not sustainable long term solution for this country we need to retain recruit and retrain more radiologist and ensure that enough modern equipment be in place across the country so that no one have to wait too long or travel too far to get the scan that they need will the minister address whether that will also be part of the national cancer strategy we can not talk about backlog without talk about mental health accord to the darzi review million people be wait for mental health service by last april over of whom be child child whom we as nation need to protect because they be our future wait time for child and adolescent mental health service be shocking in every constituency in the country from adhd diagnose to anxiety depression and eat disorder far too many people be not get the urgent support that they need headteacher of school in north shropshire tell that in recent year nine student at his school have lose parent to suicide yet there be no community mental health service in the town along with the government liberal democrats would introduce mental health professional in every school however we be also call on the government to improve early access to mental health service and to cut mental health wait by establish mental health hub for young people in every community and introduce regular mental health check up at key point in people life when they be access the nhs so that we can pick up those problem and intervene early meanwhile gp surgery be also struggle to handle the grow pressure be exert on they more than million patient who try to contact gp last year could not get through if patient can not access primary care they seek help elsewhere or they do not seek help at all in both case this create further problem down the line in shropshire we have lose of fully qualified gps in the past eight year young constituent of mine have to wait seven week just for telephone consultation wait that would have be even long if they have want an in person meeting liberal democrats would give everyone the right to see gp within seven day or within hour if it be urgent use more gps if we can improve primary care we can reduce backlog across the health and care system yet the government have pledge to increase national insurance charge that could cost gp surgery the equivalent of million appointment year this hike will also hammer pharmacy with more than third of pharmacy owner now worry that their business may not survive the winter if pharmacy close backlog will simply increase elsewhere if we can keep they open and improve service such as pharmacy first we can reduce pressure across the system we would like the government to commit to remove the increase in employer national insurance contribution to support these crucial community service so that few people end up in hospital and more people be treat in the community where they will get well and quick treatment meanwhile in dentistry where practice will also be hit by the national insurance rise there be not so much backlog of care as an absence of care some million adult in the uk be not register with an nhs dentist and in place like shropshire it be become almost impossible to find one with increase number of practice hand back contract that have become unsustainable one of my constituent have be try to register with an nhs dentist for five year while another pull out his own tooth with pair of plier the labour government must show that they understand the problem well than the conservative government whose solution be to introduce golden hello payment they have be in place in shropshire for year and they have not achieve the desire outcome with that in mind will the minister outline the government plan in relation to the new patient premium and offer assurance to dentist that any change will be communicate so that practice can plan and prepare to well serve their patient nhs contract need to be reform so that we can end the use of the term dental desert end diy dentistry and guarantee access to people who be in pain in conclusion the liberal democrats believe that people should be able to take control of their own life and their own health that mean everyone should be able to access the care they need where and when they need it we welcome much of today announcement on elective care and we welcome today announcement on social care but we be concerned that the decision to hike employer nics could worsen the crisis in the nhs hit gps hospice dentist and social care provider with high taxis make no sense the treasury be give to the nhs with one hand but take away with the other we also want much fast action on social care as say look forward to engage constructively with the minister to come up with the consensus we need but we can not afford to wait until for improvement to be make the conservatives legacy on the nhs be that it be on its knee the liberal democrats understand that there be no magic quick fix to change that but to give people the care they need and deserve we must look at the measure need for the whole service give equal priority to both heart attack and hip replacement nuneaton too have record high level of people on nhs waiting list over staff tell that they be burn out and demoralise patient be suffer as result long wait on trolley in corridor lengthy wait in ambulance and stagnation at gp surgery where they simply can not get the appointment they need since the hospital have see staff absence due to mental health issue with many leave the profession leader at our george eliot hospital really value their staff but they be struggle to cope with ever increase demand and to remain resilient with sudden increase in demand such as flu outbreak over christmas lead to yearly chaos that cost life long wait time for patient cancel appointment and decline in the quality of care nationally we have few hospital bed and scanner per capita than most other european country our building be crumble and our computer system be outdate our hard work nhs staff deserve well they deserve government who will respect and value they and invest in they the failure of the past carry considerable human cost but they also impact on family finance and have wide economic impact on our community one particular case nurse from arbury in nuneaton who work for our brilliant george eliot hospital clearly demonstrate the damage that can be do they be in their fit active work and economically stable when they be diagnose with spinal condition that compress the nerve in their leg cause pain simple procedure could solve it very quickly and easily with the right referral but they have to wait month for referral just to speak over the phone to the neurosurgeon the doctor recommend surgery but the patient have be leave in limbo unable to get follow up appointment or any information about when surgery will actually take place this be simple procedure for condition that have devastate her life over number of year live in constant pain she can no long stand for more than five minute and have be force to withdraw from her vital role in the nhs another vacancy another specialist unit short staffed that be just one example from the among my constituent many of whom do not make it to the end of those waiting list have stand by the graf of people in my constituency who have be wait for treatment that could have stop they end up there there be people whose life be on hold and family who be suffer grief there be wait and more suffering it be crisis of political failure crisis of underfunding and crisis of neglect fully support the government action to address it rise order be now impose an immediate four minute time limit to try to get everyone in thank the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan for secure this important and timely debate must begin by declare my interest be non practise nhs consultant psychiatrist and my wife be an nhs doctor christmas and the festive period be always tax time for the nhs especially for those work on call as indeed it be for all those in the various emergency service and those outside the public sector who be on call it be important to pay tribute to they for all their hard work over the past couple of week much of the correspondence that have receive from constituent over the past few year have concern the difficulty of obtain gp appointment interestingly the demand for gp appointment have rise since before the pandemic follow the advent of virtual appointment and different mean of contact patient be now find it more difficult to see someone in general practice although overall performance in general practice have improve since before the pandemic it be important that we support our gp practice as much as we can to ensure that they deliver the high quality care that our patient expect our local practice be fantastic they be work very hard in tricky circumstance to deliver for patient my hon friend be of course absolutely right do he agree that part of our duty be to support our general practice our constituent often say can not see my gp but if we probe we find that it be question of whether they be prepared to accept telephone consultation which be probably just as good for most of they radiology be mention early the issue for the future surely be embrace technology rather than outsourcing in many case ai reading of film and scan be probably as good as if not well than reading by radiologist in india shropshire or anywhere else entirely agree with my right hon friend about the use of ai to improve productivity in the nhs and with what he have say about general practice generally take neutral honest broker approach when people raise concern about general practice of course it be important for we to ensure that our practice be perform well to support they and to respond to our constituent concern more broadly however give that the bulk of care be come through general practice and be interested to hear in recent day about the renew focus on patient choice particularly in respect of secondary and tertiary care think that one of the challenge pose by our current general practice system relate to the absence of patient choice effectively general practice which as the minister will know be private organisation have monopoly in term of the patient who be in their catchment area it be very difficult for patient to move to different practice when the one that they be currently use be not meet their need when seek an appointment with gp they be stick with their own practice or else they must go through various mechanism to obtain care elsewhere my hon friend be make an excellent point about something that be currently affect my own constituency south green surgery in billericay have recently be tell that it be to be close down and the integrate care board be not ensure that we retain what be essentially competition so single surgery will be serve one of the town in my constituency do he agree that the department of health and social care should be lean in to ensure that we maintain that competition between gps surgery so that standard can be drive up wherever possible my right hon friend be absolutely right it be important that patient have information and choice and that they have the flexibility to move between different practice to suit their need my view be that the gp list system do not work it do not make sense as it currently stand and it limit the ability of patient to seek the care that they need in timely manner as he just mention people get stick in practice that be not perform or be not work for they and they have no ability to move out of they my right hon friend also mention the role of the icb ics system which bring to my final point as constituency mp find it incredibly frustrating that have no direct control power or hard influence as oppose to soft influence over the local ics icb system can write letter and campaign and have speak in debate in parliament have lead debate on the weybridge health centre which be finally go to plan after the drama of multiple consultation my only ability to direct what be happen on the icb be through directly ask ministers question in parliament or by try to get they to intervene when the health and care act be go through in the last parliament raise with the then minister my concern about the accountability of our ics and icb we have real problem with what we mps can do to ensure that our icb and ics be perform for people locally because there be disconnect in the link of accountability believe that the secretary of state for health and social care and the ministers on the front bench absolutely want to see all our local nhs service perform at their very good totally believe that they be in it for the right reason and want to see well performance and want to help they deliver that but with all the enthusiasm and will in the world be they go to take the same interest in my local area as do we mps need the ability to cajole and to direct what our local nhs service be do in order to deliver the good possible care for patient after all we be the locally elect representative and as we see in this year election and will see in election go forward there be always hour to save the nhs address backlog in the nhs together with change the current hospital centric system will be of central importance in ensure the long term sustainability of our health system under the conservatives and the coalition government we have more than decade of under investment couple with disastrous top down reorganisation which cause the high level of backlog that we currently see across the nhs while work in the nhs throughout that period see at first hand the dire impact that the reorganisation have on our health service and how it lead to waiting list at record high and patient satisfaction at record low that be underline by the recent analysis from the institute for public policy research which show that time more people wait in department last summer than in the same period in in its analysis the ippr describe long wait for healthcare as the new normal for many nhs patient welcome the measure that my right hon friend the health and social care secretary and his team of ministers have already introduce to address this issue also welcome the measure that the prime minister announce this morning thank to this labour government the nhs in england will receive record billion investment which will support the government in meet their target of extra elective appointment week pay tribute to the dedication of my former colleague across the nhs who be work hard to treat patient as quickly as possible and cut waiting time there be evidence of that happen in my area of east kent for example at the william harvey hospital in ashford an average of patient per day be medically able to be discharge in november but have nowhere to be medically discharge to in november the figure be down to an average of patient per day in the hospital in east kent in november just over patient be treat in corridor for more than minute in the same month last year the figure have fall to just over patient although the figure be go in the right direction they be still far too high and no one work in our nhs would claim otherwise the staff in the health service will keep do their good to clear the backlog but it will not happen until we see less of an emphasis on patient be treat in our hospital we need to see more focus on and resource for community base service to help reduce the pressure on overburdened hospital as well as change the system so that people be treat close to where they live as former mental health nurse believe this must also include more timely intervention to treat those in need of mental health support currently not only do too many people end up be treat in hospital but once patient be there the absence of enough suitable community base facility mean it be difficult to discharge they this lead to further blockage and backlog in the system as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on adult social care welcome the fact that this government recognise that without address the social care crisis more and more people will be leave without the care they need and further pressure will fall on the nhs be also pleased that the government have announce an immediate million boost to the disabled facility grant for this financial year that be in addition to the million that be announce at the budget together this funding mean that thousand more people will be able to make the improvement they need to their home so they can live more independently thank my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan for secure this debate the backlog in the nhs be national crisis and it be acutely feel in my constituency patient family and staff be bear the brunt of an overstretched and under resource healthcare system this morning be delighted to see the prime minister and the health secretary at epsom hospital in my constituency part of the epsom and st helier trust to announce this government plan to tackle the backlog of test check and treatment welcome many aspect of today announcement direct access to check will cut unnecessary waiting time and if implement well will result in well patient outcome as health issue be find early the location of this announcement at hospital connect to st helier hospital be particularly potent over the christmas period st helier hospital which have be at the heart of healthcare in the community for generation make the news again its sink floor and leaky ceiling illustrate the failing of our nhs the facility be fail some of the building be old than the nhs itself and be plague by damp mould and structural issue that impede patient care the hard work staff at st helier hospital be do their good in impossible circumstance but the reality be that the current infrastructure hamper their ability to provide the level of service and the quality of care that my constituent deserve epsom hospital too be struggle to cope with demand over the winter recess hear harrowing story from constituent who face unacceptable waiting time one mother bring her child to epsom hospital with suspect broken wrist and endure seven hour wait for an ray finally leave in the early hour of the morning while there she encounter another mother with nine month old baby who have bump on its head they leave after six hour without be see because they simply could not wait any long one constituent year old mother be tell by the service to go to at epsom hospital after an injury only to be inform that there would be hour wait mean she would have to stay up until am after potentially serious injury these be not isolate incident but rather the live reality for many family these delay stem from combination of rise demand staff shortage and an age infrastructure that can not keep pace while welcome the fact that elective care capacity will increase hopefully reduce the waiting time for care for many patient this must also come with focus on improve emergency care ring fence elective bed while people wait for emergency care be die in corridor or leave without be check be nonsensical we must increase the number of staff hospital bed to end degrade corridor care far there must be qualified clinician in every waiting room to ensure that any deteriorate condition be pick up on locally it be vital that the epsom and st helier hospital be at the front of the queue for necessary repair and that the new specialist emergency care hospital in sutton be at the top of the priority list for this new hospital programme the epsom and st helier hospital trust cover my constituency as well and many of our resident rely on those hospital for their care do my hon friend agree that it be previous conservative government absolute failure to deliver one of the new hospital promise in that lead to the degradation in care for resident across both our constituency in addition do she agree that the government must come forward with the funding that resident in both constituency need to reassure they that their healthcare need will be meet into the future absolutely agree that it be partly failure of the previous conservative government that the hospital have not be build it be vital that the epsom and st helier hospital trust be put at the top of the list as priority for new hospital new hospital will improve outcome by consolidate critical service under one roof ease the strain on staff who be currently stretch across two site moreover it will enable the epsom and st helier hospital to focus on elective care diagnostic and out patient service which will help they to tackle the backlog more efficiently crucially the new hospital will expand the overall number of bed centralise major acute service will address estate challenge strengthen staffing level and improve patient outcome which will reduce the intolerable waiting time experience at epsom and st helier hospital turn to the distressing delay in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder assessment in september the darzi report highlight the stark reality that demand for adhd assessment have grow so significantly that it risk overwhelming available resource nationally it could take an average of eight year to clear the backlog at the current rate my constituent sophie have be face the brunt of this backlog she have be wait since june for an adult adhd assessment and she will wait quite bit long as surrey and borders partnership nhs foundation trust have inform that it be address referral from as far back as march the root cause be mismatch between demand and funding the service be commission to support assessment annually but it receive referral every two month sophie like many other have be advise to seek private assessment an option that be financially out of reach as she have be unemployed due to her symptom this inefficient system should be reconsider to help reduce the enormous backlog the situation be wholly unacceptable third of child with serious eat disorder be not see within the nhs waiting time standard do my hon friend agree that such delay only make matter bad lead to sicker child more suffering and great cost to the nhs absolutely agree that prevention be key if we do not deal with issue immediately they will just take long to deal with and be more costly in the long term the people of epsom and ewell simply deserve well they deserve healthcare system that work for they not against they urge the government to act swiftly to address these issue and to deliver the investment and reform that our nhs so desperately need happy new year madam deputy speaker before begin declare an interest in that my daughter be an nhs nurse my carlisle constituency include cumbria only city but it also have vast rural hinterland stretch from rockcliffe in the west to the outer edge of the northumberland national park in the east although my constituency rurality and relative geographic isolation make get to appointment challenging get an appointment at all be by far the great challenge as of october nhs north cumbria waiting list stand at as for the target of of nhs patient be see for elective treatment within week the rate be just however in the figure be in public satisfaction with the nhs stand at the high rate ever record by it have hit an all time low of let we remind ourselves of what happen between and first as my hon friend the member for ashford sojan joseph outline we have the disastrous lansley reform reform that the king fund describe as major distraction for the nhs they cause huge unnecessary upheaval and create an unwieldy structure with fractured leadership on top of those reform the conservatives lead decade of under investment in our health service spending grow by just year in real term between and well below the long term average in england of which we have see since the that mean that when covid strike the nhs be already severely constrain in what it could do the result be that overall waiting list have rise to three time their level and week be now more like month that be the record after year of the conservative government and why be relieved that our nhs be no long in the conservatives hand as the prime minister set out today this government have plan by create million of extra appointment we will finally get to grip with our backlog and give back million of people their life and livelihood be delighted that there be recognition of the importance of provide service close to people which be vital in rural constituency like mine that and the injection of billion into the nhs will make real difference for million of people across the country we be already see that difference in carlisle with the approval of new million urgent treatment centre at the cumberland infirmary which be set to open by the end of this year be also delighted that north cumbria will be one of the beneficiary of new million pot set aside to create health and growth accelerator these will not just improve health outcome locally but research the most effective approach to help people back into work and to stand on their own foot that be labour plan in action this government will set the shattered bone of our nhs welcome this debate although we have have number of health debate over the past few sitting day that have crystallise the real problem that we see in the nhs it be stark that none of the government members have mention covid thus far and its massive impact interruption the hon member for carlisle ms minns be point at herself she might have mention it but she do not set out the absolute devastation that covid wreak on our service before come to the house work for the get it right first time programme an nhs england programme that be initially fund by my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt when he be health secretary and again when he be chancellor of the exchequer the programme make significant difference in get rid of unwarranted variation within the nhs because while there be some amazing service treatment and patient care in the nhs we have to admit that there be also some poor and inefficient patient care the get it right first time programme try to improve patient care and ensure that the worst perform trust be bring up to the level of the well perform trust hope that the programme will continue to try to achieve that under the current government area for improvement include high volume low complexity work such as cataract hip and knee operation there be massive backlog of such procedure in the nhs that could be clear if some fail trust reach the level not of the top perform trust but of the top quartile or the top the hon gentleman work in the nhs before covid as do he mention the impact of covid but do he not recall that in december before covid hit standard have already fall and only of patient be be treat within the week target why be that allow to happen under the previous government accept that the pressure on the nhs go way beyond covid as the hon gentleman will remember but to use the secretary of state term covid be the point at which the nhs be broken and it be take long time to recover the government be right to push for more localise service and to bring service close to the patient access to gps be fundamental part of that but we know that gps be overstretch the previous government really push pharmacy first which be superb programme this government want to go far with it but there be disincentive for general practitioner to embrace pharmacy first what will minister do to ensure that there be no financial disincentive to work with pharmacy if we be to deal with the backlog there have to be financial incentive what be concern about today statement from the secretary of state be the lack of genuine reform there be lot of rehash of previous policy perhaps eke they out tad far than the previous conservative government do but think the secretary of state himself say that if anyone be able to reform the nhs it be labour government while be quite interested in what he be say as shadow secretary of state have be deeply disappointed by what he have say since it appear to that unfortunately the union paymaster and the inertia in the nhs have capture he and his front bench hope that be wrong and that the minister will tell differently this evening but that be what have see locally the reality be that there be problem with be able to bring service close to home my hon friend the member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer mention the problem of accountability for icb have the fortune or misfortune depend on how one look at it of have three icb in my constituency to use previously mention term there be lot of unwarranted variation in how they deal with my constituent and with as member of parliament big issue in bordon be that we want brand new surgery in the area but there have be no conversation with the icb about how that might go ahead likewise we be really keen for haslemere hospital to move from be district hospital to have an urgent treatment centre it be vital that we get that move the community hospital in farnham could also be somewhere treatment be do close to home urge the government not to sit back but to use their majority and reform the nhs for the benefit of all our constituent have expect to tell the house that have come straight to parliament from my operating theatre in norfolk where have be deal with ear nose and throat surgery backlog this morning but late last night receive call tell that my operating list be cancel because there be no bed in the day unit that be purpose build to avoid that issue and which open only few year ago every surgeon in the country will be familiar with that situation and in every hospital surgical team be sit idle wait for bed it be like fog bind airport where nothing can take off there be enormous backlog across almost all of surgery especially in gynaecology and orthopaedic we be short of theatre short of anaesthetist and short of scanner our patient be suffer and deteriorate in front of our eye some of they be die we be short of all manner of specialist include crucial diagnostic radiologist and pathologist delay in diagnostic imaging and reporting be very problematic there be more than million people on the waiting list to receive diagnosis but the labour government will deal with the massive nhs backlog because we do it before and we abolish the waiting list but in the period from to waiting list reach record level now we see access to gps dentistry and all routine surgery as the political emergency that they be we all hear terrible account of the consequence of such delay from our constituent we know of they first hand from our own family my son who be an doctor describe trollie of elderly incontinent patient two abreast in corridor and in car park he be unable to admit his patient and that be right here in london we know that we must rebuild our hospital and we will start with those that be actually fall down my constituent be so pleased to hear both the prime minister and the chancellor promise here in parliament to replace west suffolk hospital in bury st edmunds will the hon gentleman give way may carry on as have very little time be glad that the prime minister have make general practice and care in the community central part of his plan general practice be the front door to the nhs patient who have genuine connection with one or two gps be less ill and live long there be an illuminate article entitle close to home in this month fabian review by my suffolk gp colleague drs reed and havard who reimagine gp as comprehensive community health service close to the patient with multiprofessional team of health worker and with mental health service and district nursing all in one place patient know who their doctor be and know that the community health centre be the place to go let we call they bevan community health centre we really can manage most clinical problem in the community and invest in our brilliant gps be truly the key to the crisis community hub with diagnostic capability for large population would send to hospital only people who need to go to hospital we must do something about productivity start my career with four worker in the theatre operate on eight child only to reach situation today of operate on four child with eight worker as we reform and rebuild our nhs let we bring the million staff member with we on this great journey for it be on they that we and the nhs depend the measure announce today will surely help but only if we find enough staff and invest in training let we look after those who look after we with fair pay fair condition and great deal of respect that must be our mission before christmas share in this chamber the issue impact my guildford constituent who be struggle to access support for special educational need and disability today want to highlight an aspect of the nhs that be directly link to the send issue that raise child and adolescent mental health service well know to most of we in the chamber as camhs unlike many send relate issue camhs sit not within the remit of education but in health as it require significant input from nhs specialist the first step to get help from camhs be usually referral for an assessment however the waiting list for some people be up to three year that be why be raise the matter today long wait for an assessment leave young people without support or diagnosis and have wide implication young person mental health can deteriorate during that wait which can lead to self harm lash out and harm family member and even suicide imagine go through that as parent watch often helpless to support your child while the system design to help do not even if they eventually get camhs assessment there be well document shortage in medication and problem access therapy the son of one of my constituent be diagnose with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder in april but receive no follow up appointment while his family say it be manageable initially his school performance begin to decline towards the end of lead his family to seek review with camhs in february twenty month on the review have not take place his parent seek support to prepare he for his gcse even if the medication have to be delay but they be meet with system unable to provide even basic support they now face an indefinite wait with no resolution in sight another constituent have be fight for support for her year old daughter who have be wait more than two year for an adhd and pathological demand avoidance assessment despite the mother plead for help for seven year this single parent family have endure systemic failure leave they suffer to an extent that will not detail today the prolonged wait for an assessment have take devastating toll on both their life it be clear that action be desperately need to ensure that the resource be there to support young people and their family through the camhs system and to ensure that medication shortage be address how will this labour government work to recruit and train more professional to clear the camhs backlog and ensure that the service can respond in good time not year to request for assessment and support too many young people and their family be be fail by the current system and it be time that that come to an end happy new year to you madam deputy speaker if the house will indulge briefly may begin by wish my grandmother well she have fall last night and break two of her rib she be do okay but at she may need little long in hospital that her eld grandson might have need although that be not given tackle deep root health inequality in bury north be my priority for this parliament the difference there of mile between postcode can mean seven year difference in life expectancy for man and five year difference for woman wish to reach across the aisle and associate myself with the remark of the good doctor the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer who speak very well in the debate on assist dying on what would call the democratic deficit for mps in relation to icb and act on health inequality at local level well beyond what we might achieve through parliamentary question or write to and meet ministers be pleased that the government will not allow the dire record and waste year of tory government to prevent labour from do what we do well in power fixing and fast forward the nhs in bury north constituent will call jackie have rheumatoid arthritis after severe debilitate flare up she wait two day for gp to call back she spend eight hour wait in two different hospital before be admit overnight only to be discharge the next day and tell to go to third hospital where no rheumatologist be in place her emergency appointment be day later she be leave in tear and unable to speak so her husband have to advocate for she to get the appointment she desperately need nhs backlog take personal and punish toll on people life include through lose income from lost job or worse still lose year with love one from late or miss cancer diagnosis today commitment from the labour government that of nhs patient will wait no long than week for treatment by the end of this parliament be an enormous transformative ambition if that figure which be currently at improve to by march next year that will give comfort to those who rightly expect to feel the change that labour will bring on their own doorstep also welcome the aim of ensure that community diagnostic centre can operate hour day seven day week thank to the chancellor budget local doctor will be incentivise to consult specialist to explore alternative to hospital treatment in bury where fairfield general hospital have the second high average wait time for elective surgery in the country the new national standard for elective care be welcome incentive for trust that improve wait time be welcome but do the minister agree that the focus should be on average wait time affect the maximum number of patient rather than rewarding trust that reduce the long possible wait time for few patient understand the capacity demand that will come with that but it be hugely important distinction although reduce the long wait time be important focus on that metric alone and rewarding trust for it risk leave many patient with painful and debilitate condition and trust duck their responsibility this government have make it clear that we will address that on our watch thank my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan for secure the debate declare my interest as governor of the royal berkshire hospital and that family member have share in medical company it be simple fact that as result of the last conservative government more patient than ever be wait for hospital treatment in october the national waiting list stand at million house of commons library datum reveal that the waiting list for hospital treatment locally be seven time bad than it be decade ago ten year ago of patient in west berkshire wait less than week for elective surgery now that proportion have drop to which be well below nhs target and be completely unacceptable where be the acknowledgment and apology from the previous government for the mess they create backlog mean that people condition worsen force on they more complicated surgery and lead to slow recovery bad outcome and reduce quality of life many people in wokingham receive treatment at the royal berkshire hospital which be important to as it be where my child be bear and where my cancer be discover its dedicated staff be the pride of our community and it employ innovative practice to try to reduce the exist backlog for example it have expand its virtual hospital and be now able to treat patient who would normally be in hospital from the comfort of their own home however the hospital situation be continually worsen by crumble estate some of its lift be beyond their end of life and it have have to cancel operation due to infrastructure issue today announcement that extra investment will be provide to hospital that cut wait time the fast be put the cart before the horse how do the secretary of state expect the royal berkshire hospital to meaningfully cut waiting time when the department be unable to set out the next step for its urgently require rebuild and other member will continue to pursue this matter until we get government action on it will the minister please set out when the new hospital programme review will be publish rebuild of the royal berks be especially important for the cancer centre some part of that building be year old this be where people who be perhaps in the last year of their life be be treat urgent investment be crucial be delighted to secure commitment from the government to national cancer strategy for england which be very important step forward the government cancer strategy need to clearly set out how it will improve cancer waiting time and tackle outcome hope this can be do before the second reading of my private member bill on july but fear that today announcement regard the week target pit knee replacement against radiotherapy cancer affect one in two people in the uk and be expect to increase annually with more patient with cancer yet we have staggering workforce shortage in almost every staffing group insufficient capacity and more than one in refer patient wait more than day for treatment be the minister still commit to meet cancer waiting time in this parliament welcome this debate another winter and there be more severe backlog the cause be structural and predictable the shadow of what lord darzi find weigh heavy on this debate with unnecessary death in each year wait time for in emergency care have more than double to seven hour and over under three wait more than six hour to be see in each one of those number be devastated family patient at great risk or patient endure that long nervous wait this winter my local hospital trust have see average bed occupancy rate hit at one point in mid december only three out of bed be free to use the crisis in our nhs that my constituent in calder valley face be not the result of lack of work by our nhs staff hope everyone in this house can join in pay tribute to those hard work staff instead this crisis have come about because of bad policy choice and warning repeatedly ignore in his report and when he come to the health and social care committee lord darzi make it absolutely clear that the root cause of the problem be the health and social care act which be push through without precedent or preparation by the coalition government amid repeat warning from healthcare professional this disaster prove that to move forward we have to learn from why bad health policy get make because of focus on ideology over practicality on efficiency saving over real improvement and on treatment over prevention and late life care we must also learn that to rebuild our nhs we can not be top down but must build on foundation of decent social and community care that be close to home and respect the skill of those who work throughout the system that bring to my next point which be about social care the scale of the crisis in the nhs mean that it will not be fix overnight indeed the secretary of state talk about year plan but we know that problem be solve easier and early if patient be treat close to home yet the failure to plan health and social care together over the past year mean that more than one in nhs hospital bed be fill by people who simply do not have the right care in my constituency bradford council home fast first assessment support scheme aim to get people home from hospital more quickly and to be assess for any onward care service when they be at home since its launch there have be large reduction in the need for intermediate care facility after hospital care do my hon friend agree with that such innovation need to be at the heart of the government year plan ensure that we integrate health and social care as he be say but perhaps also look to revise the well care fund so that it deliver both rapid discharge and rehabilitation which be obviously both critical to tackle nhs backlog in fact the well care fund work well in west yorkshire when it work to hasten people journey out of hospital and that sound like very good example in my own local hospital trust the figure for people on the transfer of care list be even high of bed be take up by people who could be treat at home that be almost patient in hospital rather than get social care where they need to be even well run trust be find the wait for transfer of care too great prove again that we can not fix our health service without fix year of tory mismanagement or without fix social care in closing while this government face problem not of our own creation we must still learn from what have go before in this regard absolutely welcome the announcement on progress in social care today but gently express to the minister as do to the health secretary at his committee appearance that we need to see action on the ground solve our social care crisis early than in the national audit office tell we that nearly four in director of adult social service be worried about meet their statutory obligation on top of that we have provider crisis because of this instability the electorate give this government term of five year to take bold step to reverse the crisis in our nhs they reject the previous government because they waste each of their term over year of failure to enact solution on social care leave people in hospital instead of be able to receive care among family and friend look forward to this government act on that mandate order we will start the front bench the front bench speech at pm so our very last back bench speaker be ellie chowns thank you madam deputy speaker would like to thank the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan for secure this debate on the vital area of nhs backlog which be of great importance to and my constituent we be short of time so will not talk as wish to about the need to tackle the crisis in social care and the need to invest heavily in public health will focus my comment on respond to the government announcement today on elective care hope the minister will be able to respond in moment to some of the question want to pose because it be one thing to use spare capacity in the private sector to tackle the absolute crisis we have with waiting list and backlog can understand that as an emergency measure but it be quite another to propose in effect long term outsourcing from the nhs to private provider to be honest fear that today announcement could essentially be form of creep back door privatisation of aspect of nhs care and specifically those in which be easy for private sector provider to make profit we only have to look at pfi to understand the danger of that approach have read today partnership agreement between the nhs and the independent sector and be afraid find it the opposite of reassure will briefly canter through some of the reason why section indicate that the government do envisage increase private provision of both surgical and diagnostic service there be some text in section about try to seek assurance that those private provider will not essentially cherry pick the most attractive easy and profitable patient however all it say be that the independent sector will review its patient criterion there be no tooth there there be nothing in section about measure to protect the nhs from the risk of private provider make excessive profit from the service they provide we have recently hear in this chamber case of that happen in the social care sector and the child social care centre be there not real risk that that could also happen in the healthcare sector if this be not action finally there be nothing in section to address the risk of transfer service to private provider lead to leaching of staff from the nhs service into the private sector how can we be guarantee that there be not go to be excessive competition in workforce that be already extremely stretch for the green party and myself the profit motive have no place in our nhs hope the minister will provide assurance that the nhs will continue to be publicly own and publicly run for public benefit and that the concern have highlight will be address so that the agreement between the nhs and the independent sector have tooth now call the liberal democrats spokesperson jess brown fuller thank my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan for introduce this important debate on our first day back after christmas also thank all hon member from across the house who have contribute to the debate and specifically the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer for ashford sojan joseph and for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley who always bring really valuable contribution because of their background and current profession it be very much appreciated when talk about the nhs my hon friend the member for north shropshire highlight in her opening remark that backlog be not just about nhs waiting list but that there be also problem with mental health backlog handover delay wait poor access to dentistry gp appointment cancer treatment waiting time and staff that be be drive from the nhs because they can not provide the care they want to give our healthcare system remain the no issue that be contact about it be not unreasonable for my constituent and people across the country to expect to receive the care they need when and where they need it doubt there be many people who have not be affect or know somebody who have be affect by nhs backlog indeed my dad struggle for month to get face to face gp appointment for what he believe be return of hiatus hernia by the time he see his gp and be refer the oesophageal cancer that he have be so progress that palliative care be the only option for he and he pass away shortly after be diagnose in when ask my constituent to get in touch with example of personal experience of the nhs backlog be inundate with email from people across chichester and will share some of those with the house have jane who be at high risk of bowel cancer due to live with ulcerative colitis she be mean to see her consultant every six month but have not have an appointment since despite her gp try on her behalf on multiple occasion she have no idea if the polyp discover in have turn cancerous and be live in constant fear of her health deteriorate far ian get in touch after wait over year to receive scan after he experience extreme chest pain the scan reveal heart disease but the lack of any follow up appointment have leave he anxious and uncertain about his health will also mention good friend of mine rylee who notice irregular bruising and physical change on the back of their leg in and be find it hard to walk after visit the gp who send an urgent referral to the hospital rylee wait for month only to discover when chase the hospital that the referral have go to the wrong place they then get add to the waiting list and be tell the wait would be between and week we be four year on from the initial change to rylee leg and they be finally be treat by lead specialist as rylee can no long walk unaided amputation of their leg be now be consider if rylee have be see within the expect window of an urgent referral they would not be face the prospect of lose their leg in their these be just few example of what be much large picture of the nhs with care and compassionate staff work within it who be overstretch and overburdened and as my hon friend the member for north shropshire say who can not provide the care they desperately want to because of system that can not meet the demand the liberal democrats recognise that this be an inherit problem indeed the key nhs waiting time standard have not be meet for some year the number of patient wait long than four hour in rise consistently between and the day waiting time for standard cancer treatment have not be meet in recent year and the consultant lead treatment target in england of week have not be meet in the last conservative government leave emergency care in deep crisis the darzi review state that work day be lose every day to handover delay in last winter ambulance across england collectively spend total of year wait outside hospital to hand patient over in more than million patient face wait of more than hour in the liberal democrats welcome new investment in the nhs but instead of spend money firefighting crisis after crisis we would invest to save taxpayer money in the long run we would do that by invest in the front door and the back door in primary care with gps and dentist and by reform social care some of my constituent would like it note that they will not be count on any statistic regard backlog because they can not get gp appointment to even get on the backlog list that be why the liberal democrats be call for everyone to have the right to see their gp within seven day or hour if it be urgent with booking system to end the be phone call lottery to get an appointment we would also ensure that everybody over the age of and those with long term condition have access to name gp we would fix the back door and address the social care crisis now rather than spend another three year commission report that will find out what we already know social care be in urgent need of reform the darzi review show that inadequate social care account for of hospital bed occupancy mean that people who desperately want to get home can not because of the lack of social care package available and that other deteriorate at home because they can not access the social care they need in the past year more than half of all request for social care be unsuccessful we would strengthen our emergency service to reduce excessive handover delay by increase the number of staff hospital bed and call for qualified clinician in every waiting room to ensure that any deteriorate condition be pick up on to prevent tragic avoidable incident once again thank the hon friend the member for north shropshire for bring forward this incredibly important debate and thank those member who contribute to conversation that matter to my constituent in chichester and to people across the country call the shadow minister thank you madam deputy speaker very happy new year to you may also wish the grandmother of the hon member for bury north mr frith speedy recovery should declare an interest as consultant practise in the nhs my brother be gp and be on an orthopaedic waiting list so be one of the statistic be look forward to work constructively with the government over the next year to deliver for patient across this country the nhs have be look after we for more than three quarter of century during that time the practice of medicine have transform cure have be find and people be live long and healthy life thank all those staff who have be work in the nhs and social care across the christmas and new year period we all recognise that the nhs be under pressure we have an age population patient with more complex need and innovative but expensive treatment the pandemic add huge strain to the nhs resource be redeploy away from elective care and much elective care be postpone to reduce the spread of covid for example before the pandemic woman have be wait more than month for gynaecological appointment by the time the pandemic be over that number have go from to that be replicate across other department in hospital across the country although the nhs now treat more patient than it do in waiting list be sharply high we take step as government to bring they down again those measure be work though not as quickly as we wish for example the month waiting list be virtually eliminate and the week list be steadily fall despite industrial action meanwhile in wales where labour have be in power for more than year waiting list continue to rise there be more to do and no one be suggest that the issue have be resolve waiting list be still too high and that be why we fund the billion nhs productivity plan in full to upgrade it to expand the nhs app and to capitalise on the benefit of artificial intelligence the government be elect in july on the promise of plan but sadly the plan have still not yet be publish the government be also elect on promise to deliver more appointment per week wish they huge success with that but be not optimistic the secretary of state have repeatedly be ask when those additional appointment will become available but there have be no clear answer will the minister please provide one or tell we what progress have be make this morning we hear more about labour elective reform plan be really pleased to hear that the government will continue with many conservative initiative which be work will the hon lady give way will not because have time limit be pleased to hear that the government will continue many conservative initiative such as expand the surgical hub programme and extend the work of community diagnostic centre but some of the other part be little confusing patient be to have choice of where they be treat but they already do they be also to receive text message to remind they of appointment time that be great but it be already happen in fact look back through my phone reveal that the early text message could find remind of an appointment for my child at peterborough city hospital be send on july so this be not new initiative patient be to get result online well again they already do if the minister have not see that urge she to visit addenbrooke hospital where via the mychart system patient can already log on and read their mri or blood result or report spread good practice be to be welcome but it be not revolution it also face significant headwind the government be to direct activity to general practice but gps be already rather busy and face financial challenge cause by national insurance contribution how will shift pressure improve capacity when will gps be able to budget will the funding settlement be great than their increase cost from national insurance contribution if resource be move to general practice how will that deliver more secondary care appointment one person can only do so much work what be the government plan for the workforce which will be so key of course it be not just gps who be affect by the national insurance contribution the secretary of state talk about record investment in hospice but before christmas the minister be repeatedly unable to say whether that record investment would cover the rise in national insurance contribution that those same hospice be face can she update the house now patient be to have the choice on whether to have follow up appointment which will apparently reduce million unnecessary appointment every year will that be choice for patient to have desire follow up appointment that be not recommend by clinical staff in which case that could actually increase the number of appointment require or will it be choice not to have an appointment that doctor or clinician have recommend in that case be that wise it be cold outside madam deputy speaker in fact this morning wake up to blizzard condition at my window what estimate have the minister make of the number of extra admission that have occur this winter for elderly patient who have be cold due to the removal of their winter fuel allowance will the hon lady give way she have hear have hear the hon lady but will not give way because the deputy speaker have be clear about the time constraint in the debate have the minister make an estimate of the number of extra admission cause by elderly people who be cold due to the removal of the winter fuel allowance what impact that be have on hospital and how many elective appointment that would otherwise have occur have be cancel as result we hear the hon member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley talk about his cancel ent list from this morning we have have six month of labour government they have cancel the building of hospital they have launch series of review they have significantly increase cost on indirectly provide nhs service because of national insurance and they have re announce what have already be happen in some case for many year be doctor and be patient and really want the government to succeed in improve the nhs we all do we have hear too many troubling tale from our constituent and again this evening but state aim do not make they happen and launch review and press release be simply not enough wish you madam deputy speaker and all hon member happy new year thank the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan for secure this debate be delighted to be able to respond it have be passionate and well inform debate and be genuinely grateful for the opportunity to build on what the secretary of state say in his oral statement today because we have great deal to say about our plan to build more capacity and give patient more power over their care colleague across the house have set out how year of failure have damage their constituent let down the people we represent and break the nhs that be starkly illustrate by my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley who should have be do something else this morning but be not that be loss to his patient it be also highlight by the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire and for wokingham clive jones the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller outline how it impact on her own father as well as her constituent year of neglect lack of funding and unresolved industrial action mean that this government inherit an appalling backlog of people wait for treatment the million strong waiting list gently remind the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford and the opposition spokesperson the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson that that waiting list stand at million people before the start of the pandemic the darzi investigation describe how these wait be become the new normal with patient wait far too long for treatment as result public satisfaction with one of our most beloved institution be at an all time low that be eloquently put by my hon friend the member for carlisle ms minns who highlight the figure from and now as they affect her constituent on average of people do not receive treatment within week of referral the nhs constitutional standard set out that of patient should receive treatment within this timeframe but that have not be meet consistently for almost decade in other word there be people today young than who would have no memory of the nhs work efficiently and deliver timely service colleague be right to point out the impact on our constituent with people put their life on hold while they wait for diagnosis for new hip or for eye surgery if the human tragedy be not enough the economic and social effect of waiting time be almost incalculable that be why today the prime minister set out our plan to tackle hospital backlog and finally meet the nhs standard of of patient in england wait no long than week for elective treatment confirm for my hon friend the member for bury north mr frith that that be an average also wish his grandmother well that be unfortunate for her time of life and hope she be get good care our elective reform plan set out bold package of productivity measure and reform to deliver fundamental change for patient by build health service define by patient choice and patient control agree with the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer and for farnham and bordon about local accountability my own comment on the act which think the government at the time should have do more on be well make regularly encourage all hon member to engage proactively with their icb it be incumbent on icb to engage with elect representative on behalf of all our constituent certainly have always do with mine and commend everybody else to do the same under our plan nhs care will be increasingly personalise and digital we will focus on improve experience and convenience empower people with choice and control over when and where they will be treat different model of care will be more widely and consistently adopt follow on from the work by the hon member for farnham and bordon on get it right first time which also commend we will roll out artificial intelligence and other technology to boost capacity and deliver excellent care consistently across the country will not have time to go into the detail of all the driver of the backlog but we recognise the pressure on primary and community care and social care that be why last month we be able to put forward proper proposal for new gp contract with extra money to slash red tape and bring back the family doctor the big funding boost to primary care that we have see have be really impress by some of the fantastic work go on in woman health hub we continue to welcome the cross party support for our proposal on social care and hope we build that cross party support for baroness casey work social care be highlight by my hon friend the members for ashford sojan joseph and for calder valley josh fenton glynn among other on the key driver in diagnostic we will reduce the wait for scanner by extend the work of community diagnostic centre to seven day week patient will be able to receive same day test and consultation direct referral from primary and community care new consulting room and at least straight to test pathway by march pathway improvement will get we only so far though we be also set clear expectation that funding must be use responsibly to provide the good value for money for both patient and the taxpayer that be why under our plan money will follow the patient and the organisation that do the good will get the most reward so that incentive drive improvement will just say gently to the opposition spokesperson that many place do offer online access get text regularly from my hospital because too be patient however it be not universal and that be the conservatives failure in government we want to take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs on cancer the and day cancer waiting time standard be last meet in and respectively cancer be priority for this government cancer patient be wait too long for diagnosis and for treatment and we be determined to change that we will get the nhs diagnosing cancer early and treat it fast so that more patient survive assure the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for chichester that we remain committed to all three target we know that swift diagnosis be key to improve outcome and ensure that patient get diagnosis and treatment quickly which be why expand cdcs be core plank of achieve those standard we recognise that cancer specific approach be need to meet the challenge in cancer care which be why after the year plan we will follow up with dedicated national cancer plan which will help we to go far for cancer patient this government be tackle challenge beyond routine elective care such as the crisis in emergency care last month quarter of the million people who attend wait for more than four hour in november the average ambulance response time stand at minute which be more than double the nhs constitutional standard these figure do not come close to the safe operational standard set out in the constitution it will take time to turn thing around but our action to quickly end the junior doctor strike mean that for the first time in three year nhs leader be focus on winter preparedness and not plan for strike nhs england have set out national approach to winter planning and be manage extra demand with upgrade hour live data centre strengthen same day emergency care and offer more service for old people as we have hear mental health waiting list be far too long we want to build on our mission and ensure that we recruit additional mental health worker to reduce delay we will also provide access to specialist mental health professional at every school in england roll out young future hub in every community and modernise the mental health act as the hon member for guildford zöe franklin highlight young child and young family be be particularly badly affect the chancellor back our plan in the budget with an extra million over the next two year to open new mental health crisis centre and help reduce pressure on service will the minister give way would like to but be afraid need to adhere to the time limit in closing on second reading of the national health service act nye bevan warn we against follow abstract principle that work on paper but not in the real world this government be interested only in what work and we know we must do thing differently because the backlog begin to build before the pandemic nhs constitutional standard have not be meet for more than decade whatever the last government be do it be not work that be why our elective reform plan will do thing differently give patient more choice and more control over their treatment make great use of technology include the nhs app to give patient the convenience of seven day diagnostic service in response to the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns we will use private sector capacity to help support patient be what matter as the party that found the nhs we will always be commit to publicly fund nhs that be free at the point of use we be go hell for leather to get waiting list down rebuild our nhs and ensure that it be there for we when we need it once again none of this will happen overnight but we be not ask to be judge by our promise we will be judge by our result and we be determined to succeed call helen morgan to wind up quickly look at the time shall be extremely brief thank all colleague who have come along today to make such thoughtful and in some case harrowing contribution to the debate would like to thank the minister the shadow minister and the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller for their contribution and for so effectively sum up the argument that have be make today everybody know that the nhs be in crisis the government have acknowledge that which be welcome we all want to see thing improve for our own constituent who be suffer the consequence of system that be on its knee welcome the government announcement over the past few week hope they will listen to the constructive comment make by liberal democrats because they be intend to deliver the nhs that our constituent deserve and that know the staff who work in the nhs want to be able to deliver question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider backlog in the nhs business without debate human rights joint committee order that alex ballinger be discharge from the joint committee on human rights and peter swallow be tami on behalf of the committee of selection petition order that kevin bonavia be discharge from the petitions committee and paul davies be tami on behalf of the committee of selection public administration and constitutional affairs order that john grady be discharge from the public administration and constitutional affairs committee and sam carling be tami on behalf of the committee of selection welsh affairs order that chris evans be discharge from the welsh affairs committee and gill german be tami on behalf of the committee of selection police funding cambridgeshire motion make and question propose that this house do now tami thank you madam deputy speaker for grant this important debate on police funding in cambridgeshire it have take number of attempt to secure this debate and be extremely grateful that it will now be the first adjournment debate of the year be extremely pleased to see so many of my fellow cambridgeshire mp in attendance and welcome their timely intervention have speak to several of they about the subject know that this be topic that concern we all and transcend party politic police funding continue to be an issue throughout the county make it cornerstone of my election campaign and pledge to fight for fairer funding solution last year cambridgeshire experience significant political change not only in the make up of its member of parliament but in the make up of its constituency with the necessity to add new parliamentary constituency owe to the increase in the county population cambridgeshire be the fast grow county and as such it be vital that its grow population be properly protect the subject of police funding in cambridgeshire have be grow issue in recent year indeed the way in which our police force be fund via the government core grant allocation and the police precept element of the council tax bill have long since lead to an unequal distribution of funding across the police force of england and wales cambridgeshire be the fourth worst fund police force the discrepancy between the funding available to cambridgeshire constabulary and other similar sized force become apparent when we look at their per capita allocation in cambridgeshire it be only per person whereas in durham it be the national average be cambridgeshire currently receive raw deal because the police allocation formula that underpin the funding be base on population datum that be now hopelessly out of date the current formula be introduce in the financial year and be base on the population size of cambridgeshire in the county have as we all know grow significantly in the intervene year when the figure be break down they show that this year the total budget for cambridgeshire be million that be split between government funding and precept the national average be government funding and precept why will cambridgeshire resident continue to pick up the slack next year when there be an opportunity to change the formula to well balance that split and reduce the burden by which would have bring we in line with the national average indeed that million be cambridgeshire share of the total budget for england and wales of million it represent just of total funding that correlate with cambridgeshire share of current police number as of march there be full time equivalent police officer in england and wales of those cambridgeshire have just police officer or the government have pledge to restore neighbourhood police via an uplift of new neighbourhood police the pledge be first make by the now home secretary in february but as understand it the recruitment of those officer will not begin until the financial year and they be set to be recruit over the remain four year of the parliament will the minister clarify whether the be on top of the police headcount in february or against the project headcount in march if it be the latter what be the project headcount for police in england and wales in march in november the home secretary confirm that those neighbourhood police would be make up of only fte police police community support officer special constable and officer reassign from other duty on the basis of those number and the allocation that establish early cambridgeshire would with just of those number receive police officer figure which spread over the remainder of this parliament amount to just nine new officer per year give that we have eight constituency in cambridgeshire that is realistically just one new officer per constituency and assume that peterborough and cambridge as our two city have an increase requirement compare with more rural constituency we could easily see zero new officer in some cambridgeshire constituency additionally the current plan include the redistribution of exist police officer as the previous calculation show at just one officer per constituency it be highly unlikely that there will be any discernible difference while appreciate that operational decision be the responsibility of the chief constable gently ask the minister where she think that those officer in an already overstretch and under resource force will be redistribute from before christmas speak to cambridgeshire constabulary about the impact the government neighbourhood police pledge would have this provide useful illustration of what the pledge look like for the force that have not be properly resource the government have pledge that every neighbourhood will have name officer as thing stand the town of st ives town with population of resident have single name officer to cover it who be also the name officer for the small market town of ramsey in north west cambridgeshire mile to the north and just outside my constituency with further resident that same officer be also responsible for all the village that lie between those two town warboy bury upwood wistow broughton old hurst woodhurst pidley and believe even somersham bluntisham colne earith needingworth and holywell conversely the same area be cover by two member of parliament and more than dozen councillor how big an area should one officer be expect to cover my hon friend be make an interesting point about the reality of police in rural area my constituency have one of the most consistently underfunde police force in the country two misconception be that there be no crime in rural area and that if it do exist it do not require the same manpower as other area both those assumption be absolutely wrong the reality be that crime in rural area be down to county line traffic cyber crime and organised crime can my hon friend attest to the change nature of crime in cambridgeshire that we experience in suffolk and to the fact that rural crime be not easy to police concur wholeheartedly with that assessment and will shortly go into more detail about the difficulty pose by rural crime in term of both manpower and the specific that simply do not exist in other part of the country no one would consider their neighbourhood to be the same as that of another town mile away when in november ask the minister for her definition of community do not receive an answer be simply tell that more detail would be set out in due course therefore hope she will now provide her definition of community in the context of the size of community that single officer should be expect to cover will she also tell we what additional resource the government will provide in cambridgeshire to ensure that their neighbourhood policing pledge can realistically be meet by the st ives safe neighbourhood team and indeed safe neighbourhood team throughout the county when speak to resident in some of our rural village and community particularly those west of the in my constituency the lack of visible police presence be constant theme many resident complain that they never see police officer in their community and that chime with the government own finding accord to labour half the public have say that they never or almost never see an officer on patrol will the minister explain how the government neighbourhood police pledge will address the paucity of visible policing in rural area in village such as brington and molesworth resident benefit from the presence of ministry of defence police nearby raf molesworth be operate by the united states air forces in europe and with the vast majority of united states air force personnel live in the local community rather than on base the mod police patrol in the surround village to ensure the safety of us personnel while that provide police presence of sort local resident should not have to rely on the nearby presence of the us military in order to see the presence of the police as result of the lack of confidence feel by some resident give the lack of visible police presence and deterrence those in some local village have turn to private security firm such as blueline which cover the area from catworth to hail weston with monitoring and response to call or alarm activation from those who pay for the service for local resident who know that their village will be without any sort of visible police deterrent that be sensible option for the peace of mind that it bring but it should not even be consideration commend the hon gentleman for bring forward this issue one of the major issue in the rural countryside that he and other represent be the theft of farm machinery often in the early hour of the morning the police service of northern ireland work alongside the ulster farmers union be the hon gentleman aware that the police in his constituency work alongside the national farmers union to mark all the machinery so that if it be steal they can trace where it go know that in northern ireland it go south towards the republic and then come across to england perhaps the police and the nfu could look at that together agree with the hon gentleman about the manner of the rural crime that take place will come on to talk about the rural crime action team that we have in cambridgeshire and how they deal with the specific threat of that type of rural crime my hon friend highlight an important point about rural crime he have powerfully set out how cambridgeshire be underfunde per capita compare with other force and he have explain how that be more acute in area such as fenland and rural constituency can he also see the irony in the prime minister launch his housing strategy in cambridge and in the fact that the government say they want to see much more housing in cambridgeshire yet their per capita funding discriminate against cambridgeshire as an area indeed my right hon friend make good point the prime minister launch his housing campaign in alconbury weald which be in my constituency it currently have around house with another home to be build in that location it be indeed great irony that we be talk about per capita funding in an area that be grow as quickly as it be we need to address that as matter of urgency the hon gentleman be an old friend we know each other in previous life we be from different party but we go way back do not know what that do for his street cre and mine but want to be here to support he as we be talk about irony do the hon gentleman agree that it be ironic that former chief secretary be take part in debate about the lack of police officer and the lack of funding to which the hon gentleman just refer wonder whether he share my quizzical interest in where those officer be and where that funding be my question on funding specifically be about the way that cambridgeshire be short change by the police allocation formula explain early that the nub of the issue in cambridgeshire be the fact that the funding be so out of date on the growth of cambridgeshire which be mention early adjust the police allocation formula would go some way towards fill the gap it be not just about cambridgeshire know that place such as lincolnshire which be even bad fund than cambridgeshire would also benefit from the formula be look at as we have just have debate on child sexual exploitation it be worth mention that we be see the nature of crime in rural area change very quickly and that the challenge face by police force five or year ago be not the challenge that they face today in suffolk the reality be that we have massive problem with trafficking and massive problem with prostitution we have problem that be just not there year ago it be all very well for labour members to say what do you do about it but we be debate how to meet the challenge of today not yesterday will my hon friend speak to that for moment thank my hon friend for mention that and he be right about the nature of the threat that be now face aspect such as modern slavery go unseen in rural community can think of countless example in my own constituency where individual have be find in isolated warehouse and barn out in the countryside usually at somewhere like cannabis farm even attend cannabis farm right in the middle of st ives with member of cambridgeshire constabulary number of individual have be live and work there presumably under duress such activity go unseen and increase the police ability to reach unseen area will be hugely important to that extent ask the minister how the government neighbourhood policing pledge will restore confidence in cambridgeshire rural community who feel that their need be not necessarily priority in april the prime minister pledge that britain rural community will be protect with the first ever government back rural crime strategy will the minister confirm when that rural crime strategy will be publish and how it will benefit cambridgeshire specifically give that we have already establish that there will be little in the way of additional resource for the county police force

shortly come to the specific question on cambridgeshire constabulary however will start by refer to the provisional police funding settlement for england and wales which be lay before the house just before the christmas recess the headline be that overall funding for policing will rise to billion in that be an increase of up to billion from this financial year and we be invest in key area we have listen to what the police have to say about the challenge they face and we have secure settlement that seek to address those concern and provide the building block for our programme of reform include in that figure be million to kick start our commitment to neighbourhood police and put officer back into the heart of community we be also cover the cost to the police of the change to employer national insurance contribution and the police pay award turn to the point raise in the debate and particularly to fund for cambridgeshire constabulary remind the house that it be for police and crime commissioner to set the annual budget for their police force area include the level of the police precept it be for the operationally independent chief constable to decide how to use the resource to meet the police and crime commissioner priority have say that fund for cambridgeshire will rise by up to million in the next financial year this be cash increase of up to compare to the current year and it be real term increase on funding for employer national insurance contribution confirm again that the distribution will not be base on the funding formula share hope that provide some reassurance to the force we understand that compare funding between force will result in high and low commend cambridgeshire leadership in run an efficient force that have maintain officer number and work to keep the community safe in very challenging financial environment the financial shock of recent year as well as the position that we inherit from the previous government have mean take some tough choice but we believe that we have secure balanced settlement for police while still drive forward with our key commitment in return we have be very clear that we expect police force to look for ambitious way to drive efficiency and productivity and to make real improvement we be support this through our recently announce commercial efficiency and collaboration programme which will have its early focus on procurement framework and work to use the full advantage of police buying power alongside the potential for great cost recovery december announcement be the provisional police settlement which be now open to consultation until january and cambridgeshire constabulary have the opportunity to make further representation during this period on the concern raise by the hon member for huntingdon about the funding formula note that population change can vary across the country note what he say and recognise that force that have see big change will be keen to ensure that the funding that they receive keep pace with demand in the provisional police settlement we have deliver real term increase in funding for cambridgeshire constabulary for next year will the minister give way will just finish this point as it be perhaps pertinent give who wish to intervene the billion overall increase in the police settlement next year come at time when the government be have to make tough decision on budget after inherit billion black hole we be work to fix the economy the minister be make separate point my hon friend the member for huntingdon ben obese jecty be talk about the share of the exist pie the proportion that cambridgeshire get not about whether more funding be be put in want to pick up on her interesting point about the consultation be open until january which be not very far away what criterion will she apply when it come to make adjustment to that provisional allocation be those criterion publish lot of hon member may not be sight on the change that may be make to the allocation or on how the government will reach that decision the right hon gentleman be an experienced member of the house so he will know that this be the normal process the provisional settlement be announce before christmas and then there be an opportunity for police force to make further representation or to query figure that have always be the case there be nothing new about the process that we be use however as say it be important to note that we be have to make difficult decision because of the inheritance we have government grant be not the only source of income available to police force in pccs in england have the flexibility to increase the precept by up to for band equivalent property or to go far should they wish by hold local referendum note that the cambridgeshire pcc have choose to maximise precept in previous year and subject to the decision for of cambridgeshire police settlement funding will be raise locally via the police precept know the hon member for huntingdon be concerned about the additional demand that population increase may create for cambridgeshire police but ask he to consider the positive impact that such an increase may have on the council tax base and as result the income that will be generate locally by the pcc in response to his question about review the funding formula and on the delivery of this government safe street mission we have be clear that broad policing reform be necessary to address the challenge face by police and to help the system deliver effective and efficient police to the public note the contribution that have be make about the change face of crime in this country and the challenge that police force face that be why we have clearly set out reform agenda the allocation of funding to police force remain an important consideration in that reform work phase of the spending review will give we an opportunity to consider police funding in the medium term ensure that it align with our programme of reform and delivery of the safe street mission really welcome the increase in police funding for cambridgeshire understand the concern be raise lot of growth be happen in and around cambridgeshire can the minister reassure that her department will have the relevant conversation with the ministry of housing communities and local government and other to ensure that we show resident

confidence in policing be always well when the police be visible and when there be officer in the heart of community build real relationship with the people they serve there be many way for the public to contact the police but we hear consistently that the public value local visible police presence that be why we be commit to rebuild neighbourhood police after it be decimate over the previous year
