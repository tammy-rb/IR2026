completely agree with my hon friend comment and pay tribute to the work of blackburn rovers in their community we be probably all aware of the example of everton and manchester united both be up to their ear in debt while either building or plan to build stadium that cost between million and billion if we look low down the league the sum be still eye watering york city lose million last season salford city lose million and stockport county lose million it be difficult to see how at some stage without regulation more and more club will not simply go to the wall the financial precarity in football be such that it leave the club open to bad actor seize on their financial vulnerability to offer route to potential success be of course refer to dirty money and the pernicious practice of sportswashe by dubious owner who see club ownership as pr vehicle to airbrush their misdeed and human right abuse to reconstruct their reputation and exert geopolitical influence it be deeply regretful that this odious and morally corrupting practice have be allow to establish foothold in our game since roman abramovich come to england as the owner of chelsea football club with dirty money from russia he be find to have fund or donate over million to illegal settlement expansion in the west bank the other issue want to raise be around agent fee in to over million be pay by premier league club to agent and facilitator and in the football league over million be pay in agent fee some agent be act on behalf of both the player and the club and receive remuneration from both if that be not conflict of interest or potential bribe do not know what be strongly encourage the government to look at this and try to stop as much money go to agent and get it back into grassroots football
