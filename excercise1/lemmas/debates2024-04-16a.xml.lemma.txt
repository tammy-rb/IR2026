fifteen year of experience of lead and scrutinise complicated legislation tell to be cautious with the bill strongly admire its aim but have some question to set out as to whether it will work with direct knowledge of cancer and deep commitment to cancer awareness want people to smoke less as we have hear smoke cause around one in four of all uk cancer death tobacco especially cigarette smoking be the single most important and as we have hear preventable cause of ill health disability and death in this country agree with the bill hope of reduce that suffering also desire the bill aim to realise an economic saving on healthcare name as more than billion in the impact assessment and productivity gain of billion over year my hon friend the member for winchester steve brine the chair of the health committee be right that we should be take the long term view and look for the gain from prevention for all that to be possible however the legislation have to work be join today debate shall keep it concise madam deputy speaker because care very much about politic and democracy work as stand down from parliament this year this be one of the final piece of draft legislation for and it be significant proposition so will raise some point that be all intend to be thoughtful and be base on five term of constituency work and ministerial experience in six department in one of my past role have to undo legislation that have help to implement because it do not work the age of sale mechanism in the bill be the untested thing it would be the first of its kind in the world but that accolade would come only because few have try and fail to carry support the bill as whole have an imperfect evidence base that be clear throughout its analysis in particular because we do not yet have the full datum picture about the effect of vaping so what be in front of we today be inherently risky and theoretical it be also possible that it may be divisive by ask one group of adult to live under rule different from those for another understand that the malaysian equivalent be challenge on equality ground and would be really interested to know what lesson the minister have draw from that it be legitimate to be worry that something so novel may be unfair on retailer the british independent retailers association point out that the quite sophisticated enforcement need of the mechanism fall on its member as the association of convenience stores add the proxy purchasing of any age restrict product be extremely difficult for retailer to detect and prevent indeed the deterrent in the bill for proxy purchasing be just if person catch and pay promptly after my right hon friend the chancellor effort at the late budget that be actually only the cost of about two or three packet of cigarette be therefore concerned that the design of the proxy buy deterrent in the bill could be fatally impractical for what be try to be achieve let we put that in really super practical term person friend year old may well be able to go into shop or online and get two packet and let their friend have one and the cost of their do so add up in the end to only three or four packet for themselves we ought to give considerable thought to that the british retail consortium say that well policy be need on id agree be surprised that the impact assessment say nothing about the impact of individual need to provide id throughout their life instead of just up to the age of adulthood the document of course do deal with the cost to retailer of check id but it be silent on the burden of ask particular group of adult to have to prove their date of birth for life be talk about those who be or look and would continue to be or to look just above the age state in the bill healthy or unhealthy right or wrong they have every right to buy cigarette and would remain in possession of that right but they would have to prove it for life under the bill when take the bill that become the elections act through the house we be rightly question hard about the notion of ask adult to bring identification to polling station we acknowledge up front that not everyone hold drive licence or passport and ensure that other form of id be available give the importance of people democratic right this be slightly different point and be not make direct comparison but for the purpose of retail free id for example the citizencard be already available however it need to be renew every few year and new requirement in the bill mean that it would need to be use for life think the government should have more reassurance to give law abide people than silence say that strongly admire the aspiration of the bill for the sake of all those who be entangle in lethal addiction would like to see smoking stop in this country so be not stand here on ideological ground be make sensible point about whether the bill be go to work we have have rightly wide range reflective and constructive debate but good intention and heroic ambition be not enough if we be to do something very novel and use the power of legislation to do it we need to have confidence that the legislation be workable hope that my fellow legislator will rise to the challenge that be present by this idea and will scrutinise it carefully diane abbott debbie abrahams nickie aiken peter aldous rushanara ali tahir ali mike amesbury
