very well have visit his constituency in former life make very good point he be doughty champion for bexley he follow in the famous footstep of james brokenshire who we all miss and who be my boss at the home office for long period be happy to discuss the issue he raise far he make an interesting point about funding go in particular way it would be wrong of to make first day commitment at the dispatch box but will take his point away and get official to look at it with interest and be happy to discuss it far the hon member for putney set out the history of hammersmith bridge in some detail she be right that it be grade ii list suspension bridge open in and have serve generation of londoners very well for some considerable time however there be few of her point with which would gently take issue first let we go to the basic the bridge be not own by the government it be own by the london borough of hammersmith and fulham it be not the responsibility of the government even if people have listen to quite lot of the speech they may not have pick that up the responsibility for maintain the bridge and make decision on its repair lie with the borough it be unfortunate that the bridge have to close first to motor vehicle in and then to all user in the reason as we know be that the safety of those use the bridge be deem to be of the utmost priority the assertion be make that the government have do nothing respectfully invite the hon lady to accept that the government have provide nearly million of funding to support the london borough to ensure that there be remedial work and assistance on an ongoing basis set that out to try to correct the record follow the complete closure of the bridge in the dft provide million of taxpayer money which enable comprehensive investigation into the overall structure and condition of the bridge through this investment world lead engineer work to develop complete picture of the issue that face the bridge the work determine the bridge to be in well condition than first fear lead to the bridge reopen on temporary and control basis to pedestrian cyclist and river traffic the department for transport have work closely with the london borough of hammersmith and fulham and with transport for london to help facilitate the reopening of the bridge to all user in that vein dft establish the hammersmith bridge taskforce which be lead by the transport minister baroness vere as the hon lady outline the taskforce be set up in and have have many many meeting well over since and it be instrumental in provide forum for interested stakeholder to work together to develop clear course of action to resolve the immediate safety concern around the bridge know the hon lady have call for further meeting of the taskforce want to try to address that assure she that when we be in position to hold further taskforce meeting it will be to discuss issue of significance or change for the project therefore ensure that it remain good use of stakeholder time however she will be aware that we have be wait for the business case to be submit and that be clearly the key part the commitment to this project by the dft have not stop at the initial million support provide to the authority in the most recent tfl extraordinary funding and financing settlement of august we commit to funding up to one third of the cost share with the borough and tfl of reopen the bridge to pedestrian cyclist and river traffic and then depend on cost to bus and motor vehicle the first part of this commitment have already be deliver in march the department for transport approve the business case from the london borough of hammersmith and fulham for the stabilisation work on the bridge which in turn trigger the release of furth million of government funding these work will ensure that the bridge remain open to pedestrian cyclist and river traffic permanently with no risk of further temporary closure due to unsafe condition be pleased to say that those work be due to complete very early in the new year and will provide certainty to the pedestrian and cyclist of barnes hammersmith fulham richmond and beyond that this link across the thames will remain open most recently as all party will be aware the department for transport provide the borough with furth million for the crucial geotechnical investigation now be carry out at hammersmith bridge which will pave the way for the next stage of the work this bring the total amount of government funding to the bridge to date of up to nearly million that be exceptional funding the next stage of the project be to strengthen the core and renovate other structurally significant part of the bridge the strengthen phase of engineering work will build on stabilisation work and upon completion will allow the bridge to reopen to all user that should include bus and motor vehicle follow close co operation with tfl and the department the borough have now develop and submit his majesty treasury green book outline business case for the second stage of the work to the department for transport set out the estimate cost range for strengthen the bridge the department be review that outline business case in great detail it be submit in on april as understand it so clearly that be an ongoing process the hon member for putney ask about the project and the funding relate to it but no decision have be make regard reallocation of fund the hon member for richmond park sarah olney also raise the local implementation plan it be true that transport for london provide formula funding to london borough for transport project but its budget for bridge project be just over million to be share between borough that be obviously insufficient to fund this project
