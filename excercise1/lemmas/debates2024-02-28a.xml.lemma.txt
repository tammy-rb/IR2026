silent as tommy robinson that right wing thug be describe as hero why be the prime minister allow she to stand as tory mp at the next election do not believe that single member of this house support tommy robinson but if the right hon and learn gentleman want to talk about former leader and predecessor the whole country know his record he sit there while antisemitism run rife in his party and he

deliver the first jewish prime minister the first female prime minister the first black chancellor and the first muslim home secretary and it be now lead by the first british asian prime minister while it seem that the right hon and learn gentleman can only champion man from north london it be the conservatives who represent modern britain so this diverse tory party do welcome nigel farage two month ago the prime minister say that the tory party be broad church welcome lot of people who want to subscribe to our ideal to our value that be the same nigel farage who say he agree with the basic premise of enoch powell river of blood speech and bemoan the influence of the jewish lobby be the prime minister simply too scar to stand up to the gaggle of tory mp who moonlight as gb news presenter or do he genuinely think that nigel farage share the ideal and value of the tory party the right hon and learn gentleman want to talk about value but tomorrow in rochdale the people will have choice of three former labour candidate two of whom be antisemite the truth be his party be so mired in hate that despite three ex labour candidate stand he can not back single one of they we expel

redcoat and malcontent the tin foil hat brigade on his benches and the extremist who wreck the economy be all line up to undermine he humiliate he and eventually get rid of he when will he ever stand up to they and end the pathetic spectacle of tory party that use to try to beat nigel farage now give up and dance to his tune instead that be utterly shameless from someone who stand by while antisemitism run rife in his party oversee the appalling situation in rochdale and twice back the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn in the last few week we have see member of parliament home surround their event disrupt and council meeting threaten just last week we see the very rule that govern this place abuse because of intimidation while the right hon and learn

demand that this house have its say just as it show that this house should demand an immediate ceasefire president biden have indicate that the ceasefire may take place from monday do the prime minister share his confidence we have consistently call for an immediate humanitarian pause which would allow for the safe release of hostage include british national and more aid to gaza we welcome progress on deal as the hon gentleman say there have be progress and we urge everyone on all side to seize the opportunity have be clear that we must seize the momentum from this terrible tragedy to find last resolution to this conflict that deliver on the promise of two state solution and ensure that israelis and palestinians can live in dignity and security we be approach five month since this conflict begin in that time this house have equivocate and on three occasion at the united nations this government have abstain when they could have vote for ceasefire abstentionism be not leadership should this matter now come before the united nations with ceasefire potentially in sight will the prime minister use his government vote to deliver that ceasefire we support the united states draft resolution that be discuss with colleague at the united nations last week but just call for an immediate full ceasefire now which collapse back into fighting within day or week and do not include the release of hostage include british one be not in anyone interest we must work towards permanent ceasefire that start with an immediate humanitarian pause to get aid in and hostage out agree about the suffering of the people in gaza in this country we should be proud of everything we be do to help they and to provide they with the lifesave aid they deserve be sure that we be all proud of our open government the availability of information and our open datum but with machine learning and artificial intelligence become more prevalent do the prime minister agree that now be the time to look at license this information where it be to be use for commercial gain and to inform intelligence that will disrupt society and our economy join my hon friend in his passion for ai like he be proud of our record at the forefront of the ai revolution have create one of the world first ai safety institute establish the state of ai report and host the world first ever global ai safety summit will ensure that he meet the relevant minister to discuss his proposal to ensure that we can harness the opportunity of ai and protect ourselves against the risk that it pose plaid cymru have sign full fact pledge for an honest general election campaign one of full fact four ask be to renounce deceptive campaigning tactic there be evidence of egregious mislead campaigning in wales and elsewhere by the conservatives in recent week we all have responsibility to campaign honestly because the alternative be to be complicit in dismantle democracy therefore will the prime minister sign full fact pledge for an honest election be pleased to be in wales just last week and these be the fact on the ground the labour run welsh nhs be perform the bad in the united kingdom small welsh business include pub

have surgery to go to can the prime minister assure that when such decision be take by landlord there be appropriate infrastructure in place to support nhs patient before they be cast out to try to find somewhere else to go as my hon friend will know gp lease be commercial agreement between landlord and tenant but he be right that everything that can be do should be do to ensure that gp surgery do not have to close that be why in march last year we commission review into legislation govern these lease the review will create new framework that will make leasing to tenant such as gp surgery and other group easy and more accessible but know that his local resident will want this to be sort as soon as possible in order to take advantage of the extra appointment that we be create so that people can get access to the primary care they need one of the few good thing to come out of wednesday stramash last week be that the house unite around call for an immediate ceasefire now welcome that that be progress the prime minister be just give an opportunity by my hon friend the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn to commit to the uk representative in the united nations and elsewhere articulate that position of this house if they be not go to do that what will he say to those of we who say this place really be just sick pantomime as outline previously it be not right to call for an immediate ceasefire that would collapse instantly into more fighting and not do anything to get more aid into gaza to alleviate the suffering that people be experience or to make sure that we can safely remove hostage include british hostage that have be our consistent position we have be call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire which will provide the condition for lasting and sustainable peace but just call for something that will collapse back into fighting be not in anyone interest all our diplomatic effort at the united nations and elsewhere be target at bring that about be pleased

on top of the cost of live support that the chancellor have provide so that everyone in our country get the help that they need werrington fields be much love open space cherish by local resident and use by the nearby school as play field shockingly peterborough city council propose to fence off almost the entire area reject compromise that most resident and the school be happy with bizarrely the local council seek to blame the secretary of state for education myself and even the prime minister will my right hon friend get behind my campaign to save werrington fields and make it clear right here right now that this be matter entirely for the local authority pay tribute to my hon friend for champion his constituent on this matter as he know last year the education secretary rightly reject peterborough city council application to change the play field land at ken stimson community school from educational land to public open space that decision ensure that child will have access to the open space that they deserve but be tell by the department that the council can provide for some of that land to be fence and that the department would be comfortable with that provide that the overall site remain educational land that be something that know he want to see and the department be ready to work with he to ensure that happen after yesterday revelation that nick read the post office ceo be under investigation follow an page report write by the former head of hr at the post office do the prime minister and the business secretary have confidence in nick read leadership at the post office it would clearly be inappropriate for to comment on an investigation before it have be complete our focus remain work closely with the post office to ensure that it deliver justice for postmaster catch up in this historic scandal which be why we will imminently bring forward the legislation that we promise few year ago there be proposal to build nearly house in beautiful part of my constituency near the village of castor and ailsworth against the wish of local resident work with the local community and together we be able to stop the development however effort be now be make to include this land in revise peterborough local plan do the prime minister agree that it be very important that the voice of the local community be hear and that it be unacceptable that development can take place in this circuitous way especially when other more suitable land be available in and around the city of peterborough my right hon friend raise an important issue and he be right to say that the local community should always have their voice hear it be important that council bring forward local plan but this must be do in close consultation with local community because their voice matter as understand it the peterborough local plan be still under preparation and there be opportunity to provide comment on the draft plan so commend he for continue to support his local community to ensure that their voice be hear the prime minister talk about thing go backwards the uk be the only western power in recession with seven consecutive quarter of no growth that be the bad since record begin in can the prime minister tell the business go bust the family struggle to pay their bill and the people be make homeless why this recession which have his name write all over it be good thing for our country the hon lady might want to check some of the fact that she just outline to the house they be not quite right perhaps she would like to explain to the country why her party be stick with completely incoherent energy policy that will saddle work family with billion of high tax rise and high energy bill since the prime minister have have our back in stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke with record funding for our local transport over million for stoke and staffordshire to repair pothole over million to improve our bus network with cheap fare and new and extended route fund to upgrade kidsgrove and stoke on trent railway station and bring back the stoke to leek line and this week stoke on trent and staffordshire have see tenfold increase in transport funding year in year

connect our community and fix our break road and pavement as ever my hon friend be fantastic champion for stoke on trent and he be right over the next several year his area will receive time as much as it currently do to invest in local transport scheme as result of this government decision on but he be also right to say that after year of be neglect by the party opposite it be this conservative government that be level up across the country and in stoke on trent champion by fantastic mp like he the advent of the cromarty firth green freeport be most welcome what discussion have the prime minister have with the scottish government who will be responsible for ensure that there be robust road network associate with the freeport and that there will be sufficient housing for the influx of worker who we hope will contribute to our dream of the fabrication of offshore renewable structure welcome the hon gentleman support for the freeport we be take advantage of our brexit opportunity to deliver two freeport in scotland to attract job and investment in the industry of the future with regard to infrastructure investment not only do we provide the tax benefit for freeport but million of

aukus programme be not just national endeavour design to keep our nation safe it be also an international partnership that speak about our ambitious work across the globe to pursue security and contain threat want to personally thank the prime minister for his engagement with the team barrow initiative which be bring together senior civil servant my council bae systems and myself to drive this programme forward to make sure we can deliver those boat to time and to budget that mean improve and invest in the local area considerably with that in mind may invite the prime minister to barrow to meet not just the fantastic people build the boat of the future but to see how the programme be go to uplift furness for the future at time of great instability around the world with the war in ukraine and in the red sea my hon friend be absolutely right to say that aukus be game change defence and security partnership that will keep we safe and create thousand of job in the uk shipyard and the supply chain build on the investment in place such as barrow and derby he be fantastic champion of what this industry mean in his area and the team barrow partnership be crucial component of

great share thank my hon friend for his excellent and continue campaign on health provision for his constituent on his specific point integrate care board have the power to increase their primary care annual capital management budget so long as they keep within the overall budget understand that he meet health minister early this week to discuss this far and will make sure that his proposal be very carefully consider the prime minister have just tell my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones that as minister it be inappropriate for he to comment on the bullying allegation at the post office yet he allow his business and trade secretary to comment freely loudly and often on twitter be he content with her activity and behaviour in this respect the business and trade secretary set out her position explicitly and clearly in the house last week since then and despite some of the claim make by the party opposite the department permanent secretary have completely refute the claim that be make yesterday the post office current ceo and the department director of business resilience also refute mr staunton recollection our focus and priority be deliver justice and compensation for those who suffer historic injustice we be introduce legislation to right this wrong and we will make sure that everyone get the compensation they deserve the million allocate to cornwall from the share prosperity fund not only keep our promise to the cornish people to replace eu funding but have support dozen of business and funded project across the duchy however the current round of spf expire next year so can the prime minister confirm that his government will continue the share prosperity funding and will continue to provide the support that the cornish economy need it

governance urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make statement on what step be be take to restore public confidence in the post office board and governance follow evidence take at yesterday business and trade committee sit there for five hour listen to all the evidence that be give to the select committee yesterday several serious allegation have now be make against the government my department and its official by henry staunton his most recent revelation be that there be an ongoing hr investigation that involve both he and the post office ceo nick read have to say as former chair that clearly find that statement to the select committee highly unprofessional the fact that nick read be be investigate be evidence that no one be untouchable and the post office culture be change an investigation be of course not evidence that allegation be accurate while nick read have co operate fully mr staunton try to block the investigation look at his conduct it be this action as well as his attempt to bypass the formal process to appoint new director to the board which lead the secretary of state to lose confidence in mr staunton as be say in the business and trade committee yesterday board member feel so strongly about mr staunton conduct that they be go to resign it be right that the government decide to act mr staunton have now make series of allegation which we strongly reject he be use the nick read investigation to divert attention from the issue the select committee be discuss about his dismissal the allegation make be also prove to be further distraction from the victim of this injustice his central allegation be that the government tell he to slow down compensation payment not single person back he up on this claim my official be clear that they have never be instruct to do this post office executive be clear that such an instruction be never pass on to they we have provide letter from june from my department to mr staunton tell he the opposite his only evidence be note of conversation which be clearly about operational financing of the post office business this be entirely different from compensation to postmaster the permanent secretary write recently to give her truthful account of what happen we also release her office contemporaneous note of that meeting mr staunton allege that the secretary of state refuse to apologise to he after he learn of his dismissal from sky news this be not the case he claim there be pressure on nick read to send letter to the justice secretary this be not the case he claim the secretary of state tell he that someone have get to take the rap for the horizon scandal and that be the reason for his dismissal this be not the case the post office face unprecedented challenge and need to work at pace to deliver compensation to the thousand of postmaster who fall victim to flawed it system as well as continue the essential work to implement the necessary operational and cultural change need within the business as we have repeatedly say post office governance be priority for the government that be why we act swiftly to remove chair about whom there be serious concern and allegation and why we be work at pace to appoint an interim chair we of course recognise the seriousness of an investigation into individual at the post office also recognise parliamentary and public concern and the need to ensure there be confidence in the post office leadership will therefore ask the post office to provide with the finding of the investigation once it be complete however it be right to wait for this investigation to conclude before make any further judgment be really disappointed that the secretary of state herself be not here but thank the minister the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake for everything he do for post office and be happy to work with he go forward prominent horizon victim be still say financial redress be far too slow legal representative of victim say yesterday that redress scheme be not work for victim too much lawyere go on too much obfuscation lawyer say complete claim might have settle for less than they be entitle to and might need to be revisit neil hudgell suggest that august deadline target will not be meet and the current compensation impasse could continue for another one or two year henry staunton claim persist why have the prime minister refuse to back up the secretary of state refuse to repeat the claim that staunton lie this be the third time we have be here to find out about the circumstance of mr staunton departure the last time the secretary of state mention investigation into staunton but fail to reveal an page investigation into current ceo nick read with all we have see about the secretary of state past assurance be undermine how can we trust her firm assurance now do the secretary of state have faith in the post office board which be clearly in total disarray there be even claim that the chief executive officer nick read have threaten to resign over pay victim and the public have lose faith in the post office board and governance when more than billion of public money be be spend on financial redress the taxpayer ought to have confidence that cost will not be drive up far by mismanagement the evidence from yesterday business and trade committee show that the public and victim have no reason to be confident as incompetence and obfuscation have mar the process until now sub postmaster say that redress scheme be not work victim agree the lawyer say that they be not work and the former chair of the post office say that they be not work why should we trust the government and what will the minister do to fix this should say that the secretary of state be abroad at world trade organisation conference thank the hon lady once again from this dispatch box for all that she do on behalf of postmaster interestingly in his evidence yesterday mr staunton say that he have no concern over the speed of compensation which think astound both the hon lady and we have be fight for year to try to improve the speed of compensation that be just one more concern that people might have with mr staunton evidence but it be clearly state in one of his response it be right that we constantly seek to improve the speed of compensation and to make sure that it be full and fair and be see to be so one reason that spend all day listen to the evidence yesterday be to make sure that we be do everything possible to accelerate compensation hear some interesting conversation in the evidence session include idea from mr hudgell and other on how we can accelerate compensation which we be very keen to do the hon lady will know that the late figure be quote yesterday at the select committee hearing on the group litigation order scheme for example full claim have be submit offer have be make and have be accept without reference to the independent panel which would tend to indicate that the offer be make be fair the hon lady will also recognise from the announcement that we make on monday during the statement that we have introduce interim compensation figure for when people submit their full claim for the overturned conviction when an offer be make we will provide of that initial offer to claimant in the glo scheme interestingly henry staunton seem to think that the big concern with the compensation scheme be around the overturned conviction he clearly say that yesterday when the hon lady and every member of this house know that we announce legislation on monday and previously that will overturn the conviction en masse which be unprecedented obviously that be the key to unlock compensation for all those reason we should not take henry staunton evidence at face value mr staunton continue to insist that he be tell to delay compensation for the postmaster but at the select committee hearing yesterday he say that unlike his own note the publish note of the meeting with sarah munby be not contemporaneous can the minister undertake to provide contemporaneous note of that conversation to put this accusation to bed once and for all thank my hon friend for her question and for her work on the select committee it be one thing to criticise ministers but entirely another to sully the good name of civil servant sarah munby have be very clear in her letter that she publish on this matter that mr staunton be wrong she have also be very clear that she have contemporaneous note of that meeting and we will be publish those note that will clarify and back up the fact that henry staunton be wrong and that sarah munby be right call the shadow minister what we see yesterday be unedifye and at point fiasco sub postmaster watch will have rightly be dismay and will have feel that if anything they be move far away from justice the ongoing conflict at the top of the post office and the failure of the government to get grip be help no one and be only far erode trust in this process the secretary of state should reflect on how her approach to the news of recent week have only exacerbate that we and especially victim have all have enough of the he say she say do the minister now recognise that the good way to end this be by fully clarify what the government have or have not say through an independent cabinet office investigation may also pick up on some very worrying evidence give yesterday by carl creswell the director of business resilience in the department for business and trade when talk about the financial provision set aside for horizon compensation he say personally think we will end up spend more money on compensation overall than that billion figure which be model at an early stage that be incredibly serious do the minister share that view hold by one of his senior civil servant if so what conversation have he have with government colleague and will we see that reflect in next week budget will the minister clarify whether he or the secretary of state be aware that nick read be also under investigation as be allegedly state in the page document refer to by henry staunton in yesterday select committee hearing in response to during an urgent question on january the minister say that henry staunton sack be not due to fall out but that it be about very serious governance issue relate to the person who head the board of the organisation which be obviously confidential human resource issue official report january vol will the minister confirm whether he have sight of the confidential human resource report refer to in yesterday select committee hearing if so why be he selective in his update to the house finally it be very important to make sure that we restore trust by urgently bring forward legislation hope that unlike yesterday unseemly event our focus can return to make sure that we exonerate the sub postmaster and deliver the recompense that they rightly deserve when the hon lady say that be selective about what say be she accuse of be economical with the truth if so would take exception to that it would be absolutely wrong for anybody in this house to disclose information about an investigation that have not conclude and where the presumption of innocence must apply for the individual concern if she think should come to this house to talk about those kind of sensitive confidential matter she do not understand how the corporate world work rise will not give way as be answer the hon lady question this be not debate do find what happen yesterday unedifye but that be about one person everybody else who give evidence yesterday be clear that there be no sense ever of try to slow down compensation neither do think the hon lady be right to say that postmaster be far away from get compensation it be quite the opposite to imply that and so raise question about the compensation scheme could lead to people not come forward we welcome the fact that more people have come forward since the itv series people be close to compensation not far away and the action we be take through the compensation advisory board the overturning of conviction the horizon shortfall scheme which be nearly complete and the glo scheme be all move on if she want to end the he say she say perhaps she should end it because we want to move on and pay compensation as for the figure of billion be the hon lady say it be serious if we have no cap on compensation do not think that be serious at all of course we have no cap on compensation the billion be maximum budget but if that need to be increase it should be if she be say that we should not increase it if people deserve more she should put that on the record it would be an entirely irresponsible thing to do every time have deal with this matter over the dispatch box with shadow ministers it have be constructive and collaborative and resent the tone she have take in this case let say in fairness to the minister that he have come here on more occasion than anybody else have know he have absolutely ensure that the house have be keep inform he go without question on this commend the minister not only for the consistent and compassionate approach he have take to this matter but for his attendance at yesterday session it last for five hour and he be there for the great part of it he be right to say that much of what we hear yesterday be real distraction from the key objective of the government and the committee of make sure there be speedy compensation for our postmaster it be clear that the former chairman and possibly the chief executive exhibit limitation in their role and be perhaps unsuitable for the role to which they be appoint so be there any broad lesson we might deduce on how we go about recruitment for publicly own organisation such as the post office thank my hon friend for his question and for his work on the select committee he be doughty champion in this area and many other relate to the committee work there be some lesson we need to learn the post office certainly require the right kind of skill and the right kind of person to turn it around that be clearly work in progress and do not think people will be confident that that be happen until it have actually happen word be no long enough we need action be it on the turnaround of the post office or on the compensation scheme call the chairman of the select committee be grateful to the minister for join we for most of the five hour of hearing yesterday but he will know as well as do that what we see yesterday be complete chaos at the top of the post office when what we need be clarity of purpose about pay redress fast and fairly not single witness yesterday say that they be satisfied with the speed of any one of the three process in fact the lawyer for the claimant say that it may now take one to two year in order to complete the payment of redress and we hear evidence of offer be make that be frankly insultingly low that be true across each of the three scheme most worryingly we hear that the post office chief executive have not have regularly meeting with the secretary of state or receive clear write instruction to accelerate every one of the three scheme there be no deadline and no target and there be no incentive to get the redress scheme do and dust that be not good enough will the minister again reflect when he bring his bill before the house on the need to eliminate the post office from this process to the maximum possible extent and ensure that there be legally binding set of timescale under which claim be give the information they need and process with offer make and offer settle say that because we can not go on like this do think the chaos be cause by one individual sit through the whole session for the bit be not in the room with the right hon gentleman be watch on television it be right for people to be able to say that they be not satisfied with the speed of compensation have say that time and time again from this dispatch box and we be keen to accelerate the process and make sure it be fast and fair we be aware of the recommendation from the right hon member for north durham mr jones on an appeal mechanism for some of the scheme where people feel the compensation be too low we be look and will continue to look at that every compensation scheme have deal with such as the royal bank of scotland global restructuring group scheme and the lloyds hbos scheme have be too slow because of some of the complexity involve we hear some good suggestion yesterday about how we might remove some of that complexity which be very keen to do we hear some positive remark from the individual concern for example from some of the solicitor and from the post office on the fix sum award the for the overturned conviction and the for the glo scheme we hear how that be reduce the amount of disclosure that be require that be one of the limit factor this should mean that the timescale that some people put on the table of one to two year should be rapidly reduce and be very keen to build on that work as the ceo confirm to the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne yesterday meet he every month and we speak about the need to accelerate compensation every single time we have target for when to pay the compensation by august for glo case and for all case ideally by the end of the year as we hear yesterday new claimant have come forward since the itv series which make it difficult to put deadline on payment be aware that the right hon gentleman want legally bind target be happy to discuss that with he but we have just remove one legally bind target because not everything within the process be within our gift know that my hon friend have passion to get this right and to right the wrong of the past do he agree that we must do all that we can to ensure that sub postmaster who be victim of the awful horizon scandal be exonerated and compensate fully fairly and with haste thank my hon friend for his work on this issue as one of my predecessor know that he be as keen as be to ensure that full and fair compensation be pay to all individual as say there be no limit to the amount of compensation that we will set aside to ensure that people be compensate properly for this horrendous scandal in the week that we hear that more than postmaster whose life and reputation be damage by post office ltd die before they could get justice yesterday we find another layer of post office ltd organisational dysfunction on february the secretary of state inform the house of bully accusation against mr staunton only for we to find out yesterday that those accusation relate to another individual entirely could first ask the minister for whom have the great respect not just for the manner in which he go about his business with regard to the horizon scandal whether the secretary of state mislead the house by tell member that mr staunton be under wide investigation for bullying secondly will the minister now respond positively to request from the scottish government and the northern irish executive to reconsider introduce legislation that could lead to swift uk wide exoneration for the postmaster affect to be clear we terminate mr staunton role as chair of the post office not because of bully accusation there be an page report which he refer to yesterday and which have not read he freely admit in yesterday evidence session that he be name in that report to what extent do well that be what mr staunton say he say that it be to very minor extent do not know that do not think the hon gentleman know that and think we should wait for the investigation to conclude before we make judgment on that the point be not about the allegation itself the point be that as mr staunton admit yesterday he interfere with the investigation that be unacceptable and if we have not act in the way that we do think that the hon gentleman and other would be call we to account for why we do not act when somebody have try to suspend or interfere with an investigation into his own conduct be aware of the scottish and northern irish governments position on legislation of course we will continue to discuss that with they there be some separate devolve issue around the judicial system in scotland and northern ireland that be the reason we have do it differently we be happy to continue our dialogue on it from my time as parliamentary private secretary in the department know the determination of the minister and the secretary of state to get compensation to these wrong postmaster as quickly as possible in yesterday select committee session mr staunton speak about lobby for pay rise for mr read which know must have be quite gall to many of the sub postmaster the minister reportedly refuse to grant that pay rise what sort of pay rise do mr staunton think would be fair equitable agreement at that time think on two occasion mr staunton lobby for pay increase for mr read he seek to double the overall package of mr read on those occasion yesterday committee meeting be bizarre in many way it be five hour long and as happen only rarely the people in front of the inquiry have to swear on the holy bible that be how bad it be the recently dismiss former chairman reveal number of thing that be quite alarming first he reveal that the current chief executive be under investigation perhaps the minister can explain why we be not aware of that secondly he reveal that the current chief executive have threaten to resign on more than four occasion not because of the lack of progress on any financial redress for postmaster and postmistress but because he say his wage be too low the chief executive also say that he be proud that he have hardship fund for worker in the post office can the minister clarify whether there have be an approach by anyone on behalf of the current chief executive for pay rise and what the response be first may correct the record in response to the chair of the business and trade committee the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne say that the fix sum award be it be it would be wrong to disclose an investigation into somebody conduct before that investigation have conclude it would be extraordinary to do that in any work context be it in the public or private sector be happy to have conversation with the hon member for wansbeck ian lavery about the hardship fund if he be talk about the post office pay salary to postmaster most postmaster be self employ not pay salary directly and have number of different stream of income into their business these be business in their own right of course but there be hardship fund for certain postmaster in certain situation echo the comment about the minister and his assiduous work on this issue both as back bencher and now as the minister do he agree that perhaps it be necessary to look at how many people be work on the compensation scheme on the post office side have raise the matter with he before lot of it be expert work but if anything can be do to build the resource that would be helpful particularly for my constituent whom we have discuss before on disciplinary and grievance procedure be it not normal that they be private until the point when decision be make on the last point my right hon and learn friend be absolutely right he clearly understand these situation very well they should of course be keep confidential which be why it be highly unprofessional of mr staunton to say what he say yesterday on my right hon and learn friend first point can not remember what it be now resource get more lawyer in we be absolutely committed to ensure that we have the resource available to settle compensation claim quickly certainly file note that take away from yesterday session be about the number of individual look after compensation from addleshaw goddard end although it be turn around the offer increasingly quickly response to full claim now happen within day in of case there have be an improvement we be keen to ensure that every part of the process have the resource it need to pay the compensation fairly and quickly surely what we see yesterday be glimpse of senior management in the post office who be now completely dysfunctional as such it be difficult to see how anyone can have confidence in their administration of the various compensation scheme would it not be sensible first step to restore confidence in that most important national institution the post office to take all role for they out of the administration of the compensation scheme and appoint an independent commissioner nothing start to get well for the post office until the scheme be successfully deliver and wound up think what we actually hear and see be dysfunctional former chair of the post office that be what we see interestingly to the right hon gentleman point about compensation scheme the former chair say at one point during his evidence that he have no concern about the speed of delivery of the hss which be extraordinary because have many concern about it hear loud and clear call from across the house about the role that the post office be play in compensation scheme these be sensitive matter because people in the post office be employ to manage and administer the compensation scheme hear the point make by the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael loud and clear we be look at it but reassure he that all three scheme have independence in they an independent panel in the hss an independent panel and reviewer sir ross cranston on the glo scheme and the independence on the overturned conviction in sir gary hickinbottom both latter people be retire high court judge which should give claimant and the right hon gentleman hope some confidence that the scheme will operate properly my hon friend the minister have refer to mr staunton who it seem have serious character defect how be he ever appoint in the first place and who provide the character reference and oversaw that appointment process may we have an inquiry into that thankfully not have nothing against mr staunton personally he have strong track record as the chair of various large organisation as he say yesterday think we would all agree that the post office be specific organisation with specific challenge yesterday evidence from ben tidswell the senior independent director be interesting he feel that mr staunton behaviour change in november last year and become far more word do not know the reason for that specifically although mr tidswell suggest some yesterday whatever the reason mr staunton recent conduct be not consistent with remain chair of the post office that be why we decide to act thank the minister for his work in this area he have be assiduous in his attention to detail can not say the same of the secretary of state nevertheless yesterday be unedifye and we be sick to death of the he say she say business we be not interested except that two witness yesterday take the oath and speak to the same issue as to whether mr read have ever tender his resignation or threaten to it be totally conflicting evidence from the two people they both can not be right so suggest that one might have be little economical with the truth from dr neil hudgell though the message come loud and clear these scheme be way too over engineer and far too bureaucratic and that have lead to the delay in get the money out of the door have to correct the minister only of the fund be out of the door as yet we have to speed it up finally ask he to take on board the word of the predecessor select committee the business energy and industrial strategy committee in february which say that the good way through this be to remove the post office from the system now it may be too late to do that but my goodness be not the committee right to say that can we find way to relegate the role of the post office because that be the only way we will get justice for postmaster ultimately that be what this be about get they compensate totally agree with the hon gentleman final point and number of the point he make it be fair to say that on the compensation scheme we could use the old phrase if you be go there you would start from here think that sir wyn williams have say that but the good way now be to say when you go through hell keep go we have to improve the scheme we have get the hon gentleman make an interesting point about the post office and he will have hear what say early think the fix sum award do take the post office out of the scheme completely because no disclosure be require for they on tender resignation again think it be extraordinary that chair would disclose confidential and private conversation that he have have with the chief executive have to say for the record that mr read have never tender his resignation to or to the secretary of state other would be well than to comment on the nature of those conversation but do not think that it be right for mr staunton to comment at all assure the hon gentleman that the secretary of state have give support in everything have do in try to address these matter accept what neil hudgell say speak to he afterwards and we have speak before about the scheme be over engineer and he suggest some way to try to accelerate compensation we be of course look at those to see what the good way be to ensure that they be not over engineer but deliver rapid and fair outcome as quickly as possible my primary interest be in compensation payment be make expeditiously across the entire united kingdom and in northern ireland in particular where have be lobby directly by number of the sub postmaster who have be treat so vilely after the statement of january ask whether the minister would ensure that no delay would be allow whatever and he affirm from the dispatch box that that be exactly the government intention will he reaffirm that no delay will be allow irrespective of the devolution settlement in northern ireland no devolved minister or devolved court be involve at that time will he reaffirm that the payment will be make and that our sub postmaster will not have to wait day long than anyone else will be very pleased to ensure that that happen meet the northern ireland justice minister virtually few day ago to discuss these matter know that the northern ireland administration preference be for uk wide legislation we do not think that be the right approach but we will continue to work with the administration to ensure that they can deliver the right legislation or process to make sure that the compensation be pay clearly once conviction be overturn anywhere in the united kingdom people enter exactly the same compensation scheme they can get rapid compensation through the fix sum award of or go through the full assessment process we be determined to make the process quick easy and fair be happy to work with the hon gentleman to ensure that that be the case thank the minister for his work on the horizon scandal and for answer my letter concern constituent in that answer he confirm that former post office clerk and those work for franchise who lose money job and reputation through the horizon scandal be not eligible for compensation under the current scheme will he look into way to include they in compensation scheme thank the hon lady for her question and for represent her constituent so effectively be keen to have continue conversation with she all the scheme that have be establish thus far require contractual relationship between the post office and the individual and know that be not the case for her constituent number of member of this house have address the issue and we will continue to look at it whether we be talk about my constituent roger former postmaster whose case certainly need review constituent in community such as clarkston and neilston who have experience the most recent post office closure in east renfrewshire or the brilliant postmaster operate locally none of they deserve this mess this be turn into regrettable circus to all look in from the outside what assurance can the minister give today that that will not be allow to divert or distract from genuine focus on the swift possible resolution and on deliver sustainable future for the post office thank the hon lady for make that point and for represent her constituent so well yes absolutely we understand that this be distract or could distract from work to ensure not just that we make right the wrong of the past but that the post office have strong future as she put it totally agree we think that the post office do have strong future revenue stream have be affect by change in how and where people acquire certain thing or access certain service but the banking framework we encourage the post office to be more ambitious in its negotiation with the bank on the remuneration that flow from the framework to postmaster and the parcel hub be an opportunity for the future we believe that the post office have strong brand and strong future we be keen to support its effort to ensure that the future be bright for all postmaster declare my interest as member of the horizon advisory board welcome back to the minister he should bring in his sleep bag he be here that often be at the five hour marathon yesterday and be totally unconvinced by henry staunton accusation and his allegation about delay compensation like the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope wonder why mr staunton be appoint in the first place to any board for that matter however to come to the point mr staunton do raise the point that the chief executive be under investigation follow an page report accept that the minister can not talk about that individual that would be wrong but he know that the culture at the post office be rotten and it be important that the cloud be lift quickly when the secretary of state come to the house on february do she and the minister know that nick read be under investigation be it true that the former hr director who write that report have leave the post office with settlement and do that settlement include non disclosure agreement be very happy to come to the dispatch box any time be require to or feel that there be need to which as the right hon gentleman say be quite often at the moment be aware of the investigation relate to mr read and mr staunton that be not the reason why the secretary of state decide to part company with the chair that be about interfere with the investigation the right hon gentleman ask about the hr director do not know about those matter but be happy to look into they and come back to he be sure that the minister will agree that everything we be see and hear about the post office inquiry be far undermine the confidence of those who be affect by the horizon scandal as the minister say more people have come forward they have no more confidence than anyone else in the governance of the post office one of they constituent of mine have be with the post office for almost year and be about to be offer redundancy she be ask to take over sub post office for two month to make up the year during those two month she become embroil in the horizon scandal she be not charge because her post office manager plead on her behalf but she lose her redundancy and she be now completely confused about where she

happy to meet the hon lady and her constituent give what the hon lady have say the place for her constituent to go be the horizon shortfall scheme which will be happy to look at that particular situation of the people who apply to the original scheme have have offer and have accept those offer so she can be assure that there will be fairness we be look to ensure that the scheme be fair and be see to be fair the other scheme be also deliver outcome more quickly than they be there be claim in the group litigation order scheme offer have be accept and compensation for overturn conviction be fix sum award of the fact that people have come forward for compensation since the itv series indicate that people do have confidence that they will be compensate fairly but absolutely understand that we have work to do to ensure that people feel that way across the board the minister have be incredibly honest and forthright in all his answer and we have every faith in he give his conduct and all the information he have bring to the chamber for which thank he as locally elect representative we be accountable to our electorate how will the minister ensure that those who be pay from government fund be accountable in the same way what more can be do to hold those decision maker to account as ever thank the hon gentleman for his contribution on the point about government fund guess that he be refer to executive in the post office clearly that be the government responsibility as the single shareholder we have representative on the board in lorna gratton from ukgi in whom have great deal of confidence think it fair to say that my department and its official have learn lot from the process and from what have go on and that be right we should be clear that mistake have happen and apologise for the way that they have contribute to the scandal be very keen to ensure that there be continued accountability we have at significant expense to the taxpayer set up the public inquiry which be call for by member across the house it will take evidence in public so that the public can see what be happen and will conclude by the end of this year and report next year we will then have lot more answer to the hon gentleman question as well as accountability not just for post office executive in future but for post office executive of previous year that conclude proceeding on the urgent question thank the minister for his now daily appearance as well as the opposition front bencher the hon member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali ukraine two year ago putin think his tank would roll easily into kyiv and ukraine would fall within day he do not expect ukraine brave resistance he do not expect his military to let he down so badly and he do not expect the west to stand so firmly in support of ukraine with unprecedented sanction and massive aid to help ukraine to resist today ukraine stand strong and united and we in the international community stand just as firmly in our support even now putin try to pretend he be win this illegal war even though ukraine have retake half the territory seize in and largely push the black sea fleet out of crimea even

regime in belarus one man vladimir putin hold ultimate responsibility for the death of alexei navalny we welcome the sanction against six individual that the uk announce in the wake of mr navalny

believe in respect of military support he will also have see that along with the billion of military support announce by our prime minister president macron have announce similar figure and germany have very significantly increase the amount of military support it be provide for ukraine clearly there be great co ordination and rise recognition across europe and throughout nato that this be struggle in which all of we be involve the right hon gentleman ask about the effectiveness of sanction some people or entity have be sanction include of the russian banking sector in step up sanction which be develop all the time we will be introduce an ability to sanction ship on the effectiveness of sanction russia would have have an additional billion without the sanction that have be impose money to prosecute the war that it do not now have last week turkish company three chinese entity and two belarus entity be sanction although as be sure he would agree we do not discuss the development of sanction across the house can assure he that this be prove to be very effective and be deny the russian war machine vital supply welcome the deputy foreign secretary focus on the progress that ukraine have make against overwhelming odd in the face of one of the big military in the world have just return from ukraine with the hon member for glasgow south stewart malcolm mcdonald and while there it be my honour to meet some of the soldier who be gravely injure last summer defend avdiivka they share story about how those in their unit who be still on the frontline and have just have to withdraw be leave bleed out for six to eight hour sometimes more because there be not enough ammunition to medevac those who have be hurt what happen in avdiivka should shame the international community not ukraine because what it be do be incredible globally people seem to forget that this be not disney movie the good guy do not just win it be down to we to make sure that they have the tool to fight over the weekend put proposal to the defence secretary on where believe we can obtain more ammunition bitterly it be year since the uk last go to the us to petition it to help defend security in europe urge the deputy foreign secretary to help advise how the uk be battle as we need to do some of the pernicious narrative that be arise first in the us people be forget the threat of putin we must remind they that the threat of putin be what they be ultimately fight against secondly in europe we see pernicious narrative about how the baltics and nordics will defend themselves in two or three year time when russia rebuild itself that can not be the focus we have to end putin now and we have to stop the ability to invade ukraine now what be my right hon friend do to fight these narrative thank the chair of the foreign affairs committee very much for her perceptive and wise comment to take she last point first she be of course absolutely right that we be hop congress will follow the lead by pass the relevant bills swiftly follow its return from recess united states support be absolutely vital for ukraine success as she so rightly say be very glad that she have be able to see for herself what be happen sometimes we understate the extent to which putin be be beat back although the russian advance into avdiivka do take place those km cost between and russian death one fifth of the black sea fleet have be destroy crimea be no long safe for the russian military to operate in and grain supply be move across the black sea revenue for ukraine be at pre conflict level and unlike in year one this winter the light stay on and the bombing by russia be unable to achieve the same effect as they achieve before this war be not affordable for russia of government spending be now spend on the war or of gdp this be all in pursuit of the bad atrocity unmatched that we have see in europe over the last year it be important to point out that britain have supply not only billion of military matériel announce by the prime minister to be supply this year but artillery shell that be measure of our determination to ensure that ukraine have everything we can offer it call the snp spokesperson thank the minister for prior sight of his statement want to put on the record once again our steadfast and unyielde support for the people of ukraine in defend themselves their home and their country against putin illegal and aggressive war share the concern express by the chair of the foreign affairs committee the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns that putin plan appear to be to keep the war go until ukraine democratic ally lose interest and somehow let support slip away that simply can not be allow to happen have speak to colleague who have just return from kyiv they be attend event to mark the second anniversary of the war and they report that at this critical time ukraine need our help now every bit as much as it do on the day putin attack first and foremost we must guard against complacency we can not let the ukrainian people down simply because we lose interest because if ukraine lose we all lose very much welcome the uk government financial and military support package and the new billion multi year funding package from the european union as well as the fact that germany have commit to double its military aid share the minister hope that many of ukraine ally will now follow that lead most notably the united states its prevarication have surely only embolden ukraine enemy and depress the ukrainian people far however there be still so much we can do take the minister point about the sanction regime but what about use frozen russian asset to assist putin war victim most notably the billion sit in london bank two year on from the sale of chelsea football club as we look ahead have the fcdo atrocity prevention monitoring body be keep track of breach of international law and war crime be commit by russia in ukraine with marked increase in the targeting of civilian in kyiv odesa kharkiv and lviv be the uk government prepare case for the international criminal court against russia for the deliberate targeting and bombardment of civilian in ukraine want to thank the hon gentleman for his supportive comment as say to the shadow foreign secretary the fact that the house speak with one voice on this matter give britain much great authority in the council of the world the hon gentleman warn against complacency and hope he will agree that britain have show no sign of backslide on this no country have do more than the uk we be the first to supply tank and long range missile we be assist in scour the world for soviet legacy stock and britain recently announce million for drone to be make both in the uk and in ukraine can tell he that the european peace facility which will provide funding for ukraine armed force be progress he will also know that britain and the nordics together have set up the international fund for ukraine which have now raise more than billion so hope can satisfy he that there be no complacency whatsoever the hon gentleman ask about the chelsea fund can tell he that there be immense frustration that the chelsea fund be not out and operate at this time we be do everything we can within significant and irritate level of difficulty to get it deploy we will do that as fast as we possibly can he end his comment on war crime the government along with our ally be do everything we can to ensure that there be no question of putin not be hold to account when this dreadful conflict be over may welcome my right hon friend statement in an interview this week ukraine national security adviser warn that the kremlin be well equip than ever to disrupt election use artificial intelligence can the house get an update on the uk readiness to deal with this kind of assault on our democracy my right hon friend make very good point he be right to flag up the deep concern that exist about that issue it be not for to answer his specific point about the step the government be take to protect we from that but certainly there be other ministers more directly associate with it who will be able to give he full update notwithstanding the minister upbeat tone in his response to the chair of the select committee the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns he acknowledge that vital american support be still be hold up in congress because of trump support republicans do he agree that self preen british politician who fawn at trump do nothing but give succour to putin and his murderous regime we be do everything we can to ensure that we play our part in persuade our many friend in congress to support this measure the right hon gentleman will have see what the foreign secretary do when he be there and he may well have see the powerful article that be widely available in the united states hope he will conclude from that that we be do everything we can to pursue the result that he and both want my right hon friend will be aware that estimate for the cost of restoration and rebuilding of ukraine be now reach trillion warmly welcome the foreign secretary suggestion that we start use frozen russian asset of up to billion for that purpose now can my right hon friend say what progress be be make to achieve that hope that in due course we will have more to say on the specific provision my right hon friend ask about he will recall the ukraine reconstruction conference that take place in london last year where we announce number of specific measure to lay the foundation for ukraine long term future hope very much that the million of new capital that be announce then along with the million uk loan guarantee via the world bank be see as down payment on that effort in respect of the use of wide funding he may be sure that his word be be hear may back the comment of the right hon member for exeter mr bradshaw you can back trump or you can back ukraine you can not do both no member of this house should try to ride two horse at once on this conflict be probably one of the few member of parliament who have be to avdiivka kramatorsk and slovyansk go back over six year that long line of blood in the loss of avdiivka two week ago can be draw back to two thing first weapon be hold up vis vis what be go on in washington in congress and secondly this be another frustration that ukrainians tell about this weekend when be there with the chair of the foreign affairs committee the slow yes they get from europe when europe and the west decide to provide certain type of capability it be slow yes to provide it and then even slow again to get it into ukraine to be use that be what will see town such as kramatorsk go next there be rightly determination to win but there be an anxiety in that country that have not experience in all the time have be go for six or seven year what be the minister plan not just to keep do more of what the government have be do on weapon which commend wholeheartedly but to turn the slow yes into fast yes so that ukraine can achieve the victory it need in respect of the first part of what the hon gentleman say he underline the point that have repeatedly make today about the importance of the american contribution get through congress and arrive in material term at the front as swiftly as possible on his second point we be do everything we possibly can the foreign secretary and prime minister have clearly be in the lead in the support that europe be give to ukraine we be seek to persuade in every way all our friend and ally to do the same submit to he that in recent month there have be welcome increase in that support from our european ally and hope he will share my pride that the united kingdom be right at the forefront of those press for more and well in the future forgive mr deputy speaker if flee the chamber for meeting of the liaison committee which must attend immediately after this question may point out to my right hon friend the minister that it be notable how swiftly no play down president macron suggestion that french or nato troop might be directly deploy to the conflict in ukraine can that be use to demonstrate how vacillation in washington will lead to escalation in europe could the european member of nato perhaps explore some kind of lend lease arrangement with the united states as we have in the to period first may wish my hon friend every success in his outing at the liaison committee this afternoon he be right that we need to stretch every sinew to ensure we give as much support as we can in the way he suggest but must re echo the word of the nato secretary general jens stoltenberg when he say yesterday that there be no plan for nato combat troop to be on the ground in ukraine on behalf of the liberal democrats add to the consensus that parliament have express so far this afternoon in support this statement and the government position on ukraine sky news report last week that uk export equipment may be wind up in russia such as drone equipment that have be export to kyrgyzstan uzbekistan and armenia export of heavy machinery to kyrgyzstan have grow by in the past year what more will the government do to keep dual use good from end up in the occupy oblast of ukraine give that end user declaration be plainly not sufficient first thank the hon and gallant gentleman for his support as have say it greatly strengthen the british government position that there be that support across the house the point he make underline the importance of move sanction along all the time to take account of thing we discover that be happen such as clever way of breach sanction and way of close down loophole that be very much what we be do mention early that we be seek to introduce power to sanction individual ship we know that company be involve in circumvent western sanction we take step all the time to close down those loophole and we will continue to do so on those who be circumvent sanction perhaps through third country in central asia or elsewhere do the minister of state believe that the current penalty for breach sanction be sufficient if not when might the government bring forward new legislation or take action to increase those penalty will the government make public those who breach sanction and british company that try to avoid these sanction so that they be show to have do what they have do so as to send signal to other people who might be tempt to do the same thing finally on vladimir kara murza thank the government for take more action than they perhaps previously have thank the shadow foreign secretary and those on other benches for the cross party support there have be talk of potential prisoner exchange between the united states government and the russian government vladimir kara murza be joint british and russian national but he be live and his family still live in washington dc he work there urge the minister he do not have to make public comment now to explore the principle of work with the americans to ensure that should there be any prisoner swap vladimir be part of that exchange thank my right hon friend for his comment about vladimir kara murza he will know that we have sanction individual include two individual involve in mr kara murza early poisoning we do not engage in prisoner exchange because do so would put target on the back of so many british citizen however he may rest assure that we be explore all possible way of get mr kara murza out on my right hon friend comment about sanction of course sanction be design to close down support for putin illegal war machine whenever we can we do prosecute people who break our law but as have mention to right hon and hon member we be seek all the time to ensure that the sanction regime be as effective and all engross as it can possibly be may from the democratic unionist party benches thank the government for their work in send military aid financial aid and moral and political support to ukraine as well as the effort to try to keep some of our reluctant ally supply the good and military equipment they have promise the minister have give an upbeat version of the story in ukraine at the moment but the fact be that retreat have be force on ukrainians because of the weight of russian military might what step be he take first to stop those who be inadvertently break sanction which be help the russian military secondly to release fund which freeze at present but could be use and thirdly to encourage other european country to give the military aid they have promise but have not yet be deliver thank the right hon member and his hon friend for their support of the government position he describe my summary of the situation as upbeat hope he will accept that it be also candid be try to paint for the house picture of what be happen on the ground and the step that the house rightly expect the government to take to forward the endeavour that have bring the house together so comprehensively on the development of sanction as have say they be become increasingly effective and sophisticated as they bear down on loophole or way of get round they that have deny the russian war machine some billion which be something like four year of run cost for this war hope the right hon member will see that that be the result of the painstaking work that we along with our ally be undertake to make the sanction regime as successful and effective as possible give the vital role of international support for ukraine it be good over the weekend to be part of four party delegation to kyiv show the house united support for the war effort it be rightly describe not as war between ukraine and russia but as war between putin and democracy we all know that if putin win europe will again go down the dark path we go down nine decade ago welcome the statement on support want to focus on drone and how we have see they almost transform what happen on the battlefield what particular discussion be be have about enable increase production of drone to be use offensively against russian force and about technical countermeasure to protect force that be find themselves under constant attack thank my hon friend very much for his remark he will know that my hon friend the minister for defence procurement who be in his place launch the drone strategy last thursday hope he agree that it be highly effective and just what be require give the importance and effectiveness of drone and drone technology also thank he for be part of the important four party delegation about which have hear and for the eloquent way in which he set out why the position and the action we be take in what be an existential challenge to our generation be so important sky news recently report on sanction evasion and thing be move via kyrgyzstan armenia and uzbekistan to support putin war machine which suggest be facilitate more often than not by professional enabler right here in the uk through the use of shell company limited liability partnership and scottish limited partnership have be bang on about that for year the loophole evidently still exist and be still be abuse and they come from here what conversation have the minister have with companies house and his majesty revenue and customs to close those loophole shut down those company and go after the people and the professional enabler who sit behind the sanction evade mechanism be carry out here save the child estimate that child have be forcibly remove from their parent in ukraine and send to russia what diplomatic effort be the government make to reunite those family on the hon lady second point it be absolutely appalling that large number of child have be take in that way we be in frequent discussion with the international red cross to try to ensure that all possible progress be make in respect of their return in term of the example give of the technical way in which sanction can be evade the hon lady ask whether conversation be go on about close down those loophole they certainly be and think we will see that at each turn of the ratchet we get more effective in close down loophole and stop people evade the sanction and the will of the house which be so important in deprive the putin war machine of the fuel it need my right hon friend rightly highlight the strengthening of nato with finland and sweden choosing to join since this illegal invasion be launch by putin look ahead to july nato summit in washington will the government intensify work so that it result in strong alliance and more support for ukraine any other outcome only weaken our collective security my hon friend be absolutely right and we will do everything we possibly can end by say that the key step we will take will be to strengthen ukraine in its fight to ensure that ukraine win the war if putin prolong it and to lay the foundation for ukraine long term future recently we have see british international investment the government development finance institution and the international financial corporation from the world bank join together to facilitate trade finance we see the million uk loan guarantee via the world bank we be determined not only to prosecute in every way we can support for ukraine in this existential struggle but to look to the future and lie these foundation for ukraine in the long term thank the minister for his statement and for respond to question slava ukraini defence acquisition reform with your permission mr deputy speaker would like to make statement on our plan for reform of the ministry of defence acquisition system nimrod snatch land rovers ajax crowsnest and morpheus the narrative of our acquisition system have long be dog by major programme that be variously over complex over budget and over time of course military procurement be inherently complex and external factor supply chain disruption in particular have cause delay across the board that be likely to continue hit programme for the time be it be also true that our system have excel at procure vast quantity of ordnance into ukraine we have not stand still we have be identify and address systemic issue that impact on delivery we have be drive pace and agility through streamlined process and increase the capability and capacity of our senior responsible owner and over the last six year defence equipment and support have come long way in its internal reform effort none the less the long stand weakness of defence acquisition be well know they include tendency for exquisite procurement potentially too bespoke to export leave industrial capacity vulnerable and as sheldon ajax report assess personnel wary of speak up as problem emerge in my view the most significant issue be model of delegate authority implement after lord levene report which be suppose to drive financial responsibility but instead make prioritisation hard to achieve in practice with budget under strain from inflation the result be inevitable what we call over programming where in the absence of effective prioritisation too many project be chase finite amount of funding inadvertently that drive competition between the three single service each vie to get their programme on contract know that funding be oversubscribed such over programming can only be deal with in one way delay shift programme to the right to make the book balance none of those problem compare with the most compelling reason for reform in world where our adversary be threaten to out compete we in capability term we have no choice but to reform acquisition or we will see our military competitiveness diminish ukraine have show that today battlespace be highly contest and integrated operation be essential in we announce the integrate operating concept recognise the military need for an integrated concept of operation but maintain delegate procurement system today announce our new integrate procurement model in world where multi domain communication be critical and data integration be paramount at the same time our kit must be secure with key element make in the uk and we must prioritise procure enabler alongside the shiny new platform that can not work without they what do that mean in practice there will be five key feature of our new approach first it will be join up with procurement anchor in pan defence affordability rather than ad hoc silos that be vulnerable to over programming key example will be our pende munition strategy top priority give our need to replenish weapon stock to war fighting level pan defence prioritisation of munition procurement will be drive not only by the hard reality of the great threat we face but by the scale of demand signal require for always on production the optimal outcome for both military and industry secondly we will have new check and balance to challenge assumption at the outset of programme specifically our new integration design authority base within strategic command will be empower to ensure that our new approach be adopt in practice if requirement lack plan for datum integration or accompany enabler the proposal will be send back the authority will also be able to monitor programme where opportunity may arise such as to well harness al or novel technology meanwhile in the mod largely civilian sphere defence wide portfolio approach will bring together all the expertise at our disposal to enable properly inform choice and decision on priority the aim will be to provide credible second opinion for ministers to weigh alongside the military propose requirement in particular there will be far strong role for our brilliant scientist at the defence science and technology laboratory to focus on technological viability expert will be task with market analysis and prioritise advice on industrial option ensure that we make the well inform decision on whether to go for off the shelf sovereign manufacture or somewhere in between to avoid new oversight lead simply to more red tape the reform take place hand in hand with defence design aim at streamline our internal process the third key feature be prioritise exportability which will now be consider in depth from the very outset of programme to maximise the potential market for give capability and therefore drive british industrial resilience that be why one of the key expert voice will be our export specialist at the moment their primary focus be on export campaign largely for mature product however want that expertise to be embed within the mod acquisition process from the beginning give we robust datum to quantify the risk that bespoke requirement might create delta between our need and international demand above all that mean that our international export campaign can commence at far early point in the product life cycle the fourth feature of our new approach be to empower industrial innovation we have already start our radical new venture of engage industry at secret to give the strong possible understanding of our future requirement my aim be to embed this approach throughout procurement drive the deep possible relationship with industry to enable entrepreneurial innovation to flourish and our supply chain to become more resilient more holistic supplier management approach will complement that by enable the department to speak with clear voice regard priority once on contract fifthly we will pursue spiral development by default seek to of the possible rather than strive for perfection for such spiral programme we will abolish initial operating capability and full operating capability instead of ioc or foc there will be mdc the minimum deployable capability there will have to be exception but we have set new default time target for programme three year for digital and five for platform this be all about pace but to achieve pace we need the right people capable senior responsible owner operate in an environment of psychological safety as such and give the emphasis on our people and psychological safety be pleased to report that we believe we have now implement all recommendation of the sheldon review finally how will this systematic change be implement say to the defence committee that our plan be to launch our new model in the next financial year from the second week of april the integration design authority will formally deliver its new oversight function in support of the integrate procurement model for major new programme start after that date newly form expert advice will be make available to ministers ensure that we thrash out all the hard issue at the beginning of major procurement lock down the key policy decision so that our sro and commercial function can deliver at pace from then for contractual reason exist programme will continue under their current procurement mode but on april we will publish our new spiral development playbook so that exist programme that can adopt spiral feature will be empower to do so on exportability yesterday publish the next stage of our new medium helicopter competition which include strong weighting for export to ensure that the high quality rotary work that it will support in the uk be sustainable in the long term such an approach to weight exportability where appropriate will become the default from april from that date our three and five year target will apply to new programme include top priority pende procurement such as the mobile fire platform ukraine have show how close combat artillery remain critical to warfighting we will now accelerate that crucial acquisition exemplify our new approach whereby we will order critical enabler in parallel to the platform itself particularly ammunition ukraine have also show the importance of drone uncrewed system will form the first overall category of pipe cleaner for the integrate procurement model from end to end alongside this statement be today publish short guidance note explain the nut and bolt of our new acquisition approach copy will be place in the library and will be available in the vote office after have sit down the current environment in which we find ourselves war in europe have make it impossible to ignore the urgent need for change commend this statement to the house let begin by thank the minister for his statement and for early sight of it defence procurement matter it provide the vital kit that our force need to fight as well as support hundred of thousand of uk job we need to get this right as nation both for our national security and for economic growth however defence procurement be mess it need deep and major reform the public accounts committee describe it as broken and repeatedly waste taxpayer money it have be mess for the last year since the conservatives have waste billion of taxpayer money through mismanagement of defence procurement programme billion have be waste in this parliament alone with of major project not on time or on budget this government be fail british force and british taxpayer time and again this government have be criticise for poor performance on defence procurement there have be national audit office report on procurement in the mod since four report by the defence committee and eight report by the public accounts committee they have all be critical some highly critical of this government it be right that the minister propose some change we welcome that he mention ajax can he explain how his proposal would have stop the disaster of the ajax procurement that be suppose to see vehicle in service in but now they will not be on operational deployment until more than billion have be spend but just vehicle have be deliver to date that be of the budget spend for of the vehicle order that can not be describe as good value for money the mod command paper refresh which set out the policy for acquisition reform do not even tackle waste or value for money so how would the minister propose change stop what happen to the wedgetail procurement that programme vital to enable the uk to meet our nato commitment be cut from five plane to three by ministerial decision to save money but the change mean that the raf get only of the capability it want while pay of the original price the minister mention morpheus how would his proposal stop cost overrun such as those that occur in the morpheus communication system procurement that million contract award in be cancel just before christmas have deliver nothing at cost of million it leave our force in the field have to use the age bowman system for another decade as the minister say in his statement he have just announce the invitation to negotiate on the new medium helicopter it have take he since september when that announcement be first expect and three subsequent delay to get the announcement finally make why have it take so long and how will his integrated procurement model prevent delay after delay to expect invitation to negotiate he expect the contract to be sign in do it really take three year to invite negotiation and write contract specification will his new integrate procurement model speed that up or will it slow thing down at the front end how do the minister announcement today tackle the waste poor value for money and delay that appear endemic in the current mod procurement system he say the new integrate procurement model will be implement this year in respect of new procurement but when do he actually expect to see well value and fast less wasteful procurement he talk about procurement anchor in pan defence affordability but his year equipment plan be already billion over budget what adjustment will be make on that the long stand failure on procurement in the mod matter in an increasingly dangerous world they send message just as over the past year the government hollow out of our armed force create recruitment crisis and shrink the army to its small size since the napoleonic era send signal to our adversary labour believe that defence procurement can strengthen uk sovereignty security and economic growth defence procurement reform will be top priority for labour government to ensure that our troop have the kit they need to fight and to fulfil our nato obligation be grateful to the right hon lady for her comment some issue be above party politic and play politic especially when we look at the threat we face and our need for more competitive military procurement but she be aware for all she say that we have see one year reduction in procurement time from december to december there have be extraordinary effort in in particular to get equipment into ukraine we should never understate the way we have gift our own stock and scour the world to find an enormous amount of munition not least artillery shell that be very positive procurement and in the hour of need as far as ukraine be concern the right hon lady ask perfectly fair question obviously we can not say how any of the measure would have work in the past but let take one of her hypothetical question how would ajax the key example give the sheldon report have be help can only speculate but the emphasis on exportability for example will be robust and from the start of programme that apply more pressure where requirement be overly exquisite because it will be balance out by international demand the reason we want to promote exportability be ultimately to strengthen the resilience of our industrial base our market be not big enough if we have that check in place it will reduce the tendency towards the exquisite secondly we will have new set up in term of the expert advice we receive at the beginning the second opinion as call it in particular from scientist at the defence science and technology laboratory export expert at the department for business and trade and our own civil servant on finance and so on we will have very clear advice which will look at the technical issue around potential platform at the moment to be frank appreciate this be only possible to say from internal knowledge we do not get that level of balance and challenge against the primary requirement come forward from the frontline command the right hon lady ask how the new model would apply to the new medium helicopter and whether it would add time at the beginning can not comment on the specific of nmh because it be commercially sensitive but talk in generality would trade more time at the beginning thrash out the big issue work out and lock down the policy on for example industrial production so that those issue do not find themselves be reopen later of course be talk generically and not about specific programme but if such thing be not lock down there be real habit of they come back later and create the big delay put the programme in question so that be crucial finally the right hon lady ask about the affordability issue in the equipment plan which think be the most important part speak about the munition strategy we could simply ask the single service to come forward with their priority for new munition but the good way be to look robustly at the threat we face that be the most important issue to work back from that and prioritise at pan defence level the most urgent requirement for new munition think many people would think that that be common sense but it have not necessarily be how the system have work let finish by say that perhaps the most positive experience have have as the minister for defence procurement be visit one of our small and medium sized enterprise which be bring forward drone we be use in ukraine it be receive datum from the frontline and base on that datum spirally develop the platform within day to go back into service so it be competitive against the threat it be face want to create constant loop between industry and the mod where we be share datum and frontline knowledge so that we have far more rapid period of technological innovation the equipment plan which be very static over year will look like an old fashioned way of do thing the priority be to get technology into the hand of the military that will increasingly be on the software basis and that be how we strengthen our armed force overall call the chair of the defence committee congratulate the minister on the statement which look to the future there be lot in it to commend in particular it be absolutely right to focus on data collection and make certain we be ai ready be delighted about dstl enhance role which be one of the learning from ajax and be pleased that all the recommendation of the sheldon report be be take forward on close industrial work at secret and exportability that be entirely consistent with the defence security industrial strategy that be absolutely welcome and very positive sign above all be delighted with the emphasis on spiral development and the new concept of the mdc we all know the benefit of that get something that be right and appropriate on to the frontline where it can be spirally develop be good for industry it see the drumbeat of order and good for the service which do not need to think they be go to get everything in one bite it be all positive the only thing would ask be that we should not forget the basic the minister refer to this in his statement but sro who have enough bandwidth support and time and length on project be absolutely critical as be culture in which they can experiment and if something ai work they should be able to pull stump that should not be source of shame but an inevitable consequence of be forward lean modern and experimental they should say this be work reinvest the cash elsewhere that should be commend when sro come to the minister with that kind of circumstance be very grateful to the chairman of the select committee he be absolutely right let take those two point on the importance of sros the big issue we face ironically for all the talk about technology be people that be across the economy in many way and across the public sector yes we want to empower sros there be some brilliant sro in the department and it have be pleasure to work with they stress that think we be now at the point where of sros spend at least of their time solely on one project that be very positive on my right hon friend point about cultural change let be frank we can publish all the strategy we want but if they be not deliver and do not change the culture they will not have the effect on output that we want let return to my drone example my right hon friend speak about the need to learn from failure which be how many of the great entrepreneur in the world have succeed on the day of my visit to the sme that be develop highly effective drone to be use on the frontline the people there have receive bad news but crucially they take that bad news they spiral the platform they learn from it and they make sure that when it go out again it be competitive that be the key to the system thank the minister for advance sight of his statement and for his honesty in detail the complexity and difficulty involve in defence procurement wish he every success with the proposal that he have outline back in december national audit office report state that the mod face billion black hole in equipment funding do not hear any mention in the statement of how that would be address and fear that it may not be cover in the budget so perhaps the minister could enlighten will he also tell whether he can guarantee that we will able to meet the requirement for essential contribution to both nato and ukraine during this time of conflict also miss from the statement be any detail of the post brexit defence sector labour shortage how do the government plan to address those shortage in order to support the any reference to parliamentary scrutiny especially with regard to the nuclear programme what assurance can the minister give that the programme will be scrutinise by the defence committee and by parliament also give that we be work with ally to support ukraine which welcome do we not now need mechanism such as comprehensive defence security treaty with the european union to further that there be considerable emphasis on prioritise exportability do the government acknowledge that arm export and procurement programme with the state of israel could make we complicit in war crime that be concern for many member of the public and would be grateful for the minister comment on it be grateful to the hon gentleman for the broad thrust of his comment let deal with they in reverse order begin with his point about arm export as he know we have strong and robust rule and we do of course follow they we keep all our exist export rule and priority under review he mention nuclear parliamentary scrutiny respond to two successive adjournment debate on nuclear matter that have be initiate by scottish colleague also appear before the defence committee recently when speak as openly as could about the highly sensitive issue of the recent certification of our nuclear submarine hms vanguard the hon gentleman mention the lack of labour supply from the eu let gently say to he that when speak to defence company see real willingness to invest in apprenticeship so that we can grow our own uk workforce and think that that be what we all want to see on the equipment plan the hon gentleman make the same point as the right hon member for garston and halewood maria eagle the equipment plan be moment in time it be huge programme over year and only minority of it perhaps or actually on contract what that be show be effectively the aspiration for programme in the future there will be other programme not on contract that we will not pull out of and that we will be expect to be part of but there be room for flexibility for the purpose of this acquisition reform be to inform that process on the basis of what matter most of all datum from the frontline and war gaming datum on what be happen in ukraine and on our own war gaming inform spiral and technological development that be the way forward and think it will be far more flexible process than take very rigid view remind the house of my entry in the register of members financial interests commend my hon friend for the remarkable pace at which he have get to grip with the challenge of acquisition in defence he have not be in post for very long but he have bring intellectual rigour to those challenge which some of we have be try to do for while also endorse everything that be say by the chair of the select committee my right hon friend the member for horsham sir jeremy quin who be an expert on these issue be particularly pleased that he have seek to bring the learning from the current conflict in ukraine back into our own system here in the uk other country be learn how to adapt their acquisition system rapidly and we need to do the same completely endorse the integrate procurement model its precursor be in the complex weapon programme which have be run for more than year think the fact that my hon friend have refer to it in the current contract that he announce yesterday for the next stage of the competition for the medium helicopter lift be good example of that he speak about introduce agility about exportability and about innovation many of we have be push the mod to proceed with all those development the spiral development and in particular the move from an initial and final operator capability to minimum deployable should have huge impact on the acceleration of process sro have be refer to if my hon friend can consider extend term double or triple term for service personnel and key civil servant in that role he will assist enormously in retain knowledge within the system rise order may remind member to focus on the question to which they want the minister to respond it be privilege to take question like that from the former minister for defence procurement who follow another former minister for defence procurement the chairman of the select committee hope that my right hon friend do not mind my repeat what he say to privately when get the job at that time he make the same point about the importance of sros spending as long as possible in their role which be also in the sheldon report obviously there be an employment law issue in the sense that we can not insist on that but have refer to statistic which show that we be invest more in sros in the army in particular my right hon friend speak of learn lesson from ukraine he be absolutely right one lesson that have be strike by be the importance of understand electronic warfare jamming and interference and the way in which the battle space have change that be why keep emphasise the importance in our system of secure datum from the front and from war gaming to inform procurement my right hon friend make an important point about the complex weapon programme this involve portfolio approach that should lead to more agile commercial relationship enable well demand signal to industry which drive its investment but also allow we to take nimbler approach when deal with industry be it be right for the minister to seek to reform defence procurement system that the public accounts committee have describe as broken the shadow secretary of state my right hon friend the member for wentworth and dearne john healey have just deliver speech to policy exchange in which he set out that future labour government will create national armament director to co ordinate and oversee defence procurement why have this government not do that in the last year it be interesting to hear what the hon gentleman have just be whatsapped by the labour whips office but be happy to share what be happen in the real world if he want to hear it andy start who run defence equipment and support be an excellent national armament director he have be out lead trade fair in ukraine he have lead reform in and above all at time of war in europe he have oversee particularly in abbey wood get equipment out to ukraine and help to keep it in the fight forgive sir but yes laughter have wait for year to hear an mod minister issue this statement and this very good minister have do just that it be true that the public accounts committee say that the procurement system be break and last summer the defence committee endorse that in report produce by sub committee that chair entitle it be broke and it time to fix it well take this to be the fix it or put right plan welcome it and in particular the sense of urgency that go with it give that the defence secretary have tell we that we now live in pre war rather than post war world we must do this soon and crucially fast the proof of the pudding will be in the eating but can the minister assure and the whole house that the sense of urgency that mention will be at the centre of this and that he and andy start will now get on with it be honour by my right hon friend we enjoy our robust exchange but that be an example that shall particularly remember the phrase sense of urgency be think what the public want to hear important as today exchange be this be really serious it be above politic this be about the fact that our adversary be ramp up their procurement and their technology frankly in some instance at frightening pace that be why embrace the deep relationship with industry the constant feedback loop on datum from the frontline and from war gaming be so crucial think the committee have an important role in this regard set out our intention in my statement but for it to be embed we will have key set of milestone that will enable we if we work together to show that it be be implement if we can do that together we can put the pressure on to ensure that it become manifest would like to pick up on the point about urgency we have see what the uk be capable of in defence acquisition from urgent capability requirement or previously urgent operational requirement these harness the ingenuity of british industry and combine it with the professionalism of the british armed force personnel they remove bureaucracy focus on the capability rather than detailed specification and deliver amazing equipment in very short timescale great example be the jackal the all terrain mobility platform that be develop at dunkeswell in my honiton constituency how much be the new integrate procurement model inform by the ucr process on matter of defence procurement it always strike how many former service personnel will raise the issue of urgent operational requirement or whatever else we call they whatever variation of the acronym the hon gentleman be absolutely right to stress their importance they be not something that can be use at scale for the whole procurement system but in specific urgent area they be critical and we will continue to use they be consider they in couple of sensitive area which obviously can not talk about far but he make an excellent point by the way the jackal be an excellent platform my first trade mission on export be to the czech republic and the jackal be there be proud to receive glow review about it from the defence select committee there too welcome today statement and the bold strategy so thank the minister we have conversation yesterday in which suggest that we need an arbiter of good taste within strat comms be delighted to see the ida now be form which should allow for bit of rigour with tri service interest may make point about how we can far reform acquisition to my mind if we be serious about not write cheque that we can not cash and about financial rigour discipline and planning we need to be make procurement team responsible for the entire capability throughout lifecycle may please leave that with the minister be be mischievous but it be seed want to sow my hon friend have also serve and have great expertise in logistic and these matter in many way that be the portfolio approach have team within mod who be focus on particular capability potentially cut across the frontline command and the stovepipe approach it have be particularly useful for complex weapon in effect as have say we will be use that with drone and uncrewed system but be happy to look into it far be also glad that my hon friend stress the importance of the ida in strat comms just to be clear this be about have way of call out issue that suspect and hope be not commonplace but have that presence there will hopefully lead to cultural change which be the key thing we want to see so that we get into the habit whereby when we procure we be look at not just the platform but whether it have the key enabler if we get the basic right we will set programme up for success welcome my hon friend statement he outline several change and be sure that his emphasis on people be absolutely correct procurement be not just matter of system but about how they be implement and who implement they and the culture within team be important too specification change drive complexity cost and delay do my hon friend agree that remove delay from the programme be critical because if for no other reason the international security situation demand it my hon friend who speak with great expertise from significant ministerial experience make an excellent point agree with he wholeheartedly there have be some debate about the issue of to what extent we can lock requirement so that they do not get change because it be frustration my sense which try to share early be that what we need to lock at the beginning be the top level political decision for example around the type of manufacture be it sovereign off the shelf or some combination thereof which think one could argue be the case for the new medium helicopter if we do that our sro official and commercial team will feel empower so that they can get on and rush to the finish line congratulate my hon friend on his excellent statement what training and professional development will be put in place to underpin the new policy what he be describe be wholesale transformation of culture attitude and behaviour that be require in the ministry of defence particularly around the pace the people and the leadership of team this will not be achieve unless there be concerted effort to change the culture and to implement change programme in mod and the armed force that will underpin what he be seek to achieve be very grateful to my constituency neighbour another essex mp with great passion for defence procurement reform we have discuss it at length he be absolutely right to emphasise the importance of training lot of this be already start to happen and come to fruition and can give he an example refer to meeting with industry at secret attend one such meeting in main building where mil cap who be in charge of military capability in mod and sit with wide number of defence industry representative and speak to they the thing that enthuse they be that because we be at secret we be able to share as sensitively as possible our future plan lot of what be say be about build on work that be ongoing particularly at dns for example but my hon friend be right if we want to make this work we have to have the people and they have to have the training my hon friend will know full well that be huge advocate of leonardo helicopters in the neighbour yeovil constituency which be the home of british helicopter as the only end to end helicopter supply chain manufacturer in the united kingdom welcome today statement and very much welcome his statement early in the week about the new medium helicopter procurement but could he briefly outline how organisation such as leonardo helicopters which employ thousand of people in south somerset and west dorset might benefit from his statement today be grateful to my hon friend he be champion of the rotary industry which support so many job in his constituency it be thank to the championing of that interest by he and other colleague who have constituency interest in the procurement that it be move forward as it be obviously it be competition so we have to be even handed and recognise that all three company have their strength but would emphasise two point about that procurement first there be strong emphasis on uk industrial contribution particularly in design work that be the most important work and it be what we want to see in the uk secondly there be the huge weighting for exportability as far as be aware type be the only other such procurement where we have have weighting for exportability want that to be the default so that my hon friend can say to his constituent that because of his campaigning this procurement will give strong weighting to uk job and prosperity defence procurement have be work in progress since samuel pepys and welcome the late reform one issue when be in the ministry of defence and then on the public accounts committee be that sro be in place for fraction of the contract life cycle will the minister ensure that long term apply across all programme not just those in the army how will the much need reform help get well value for money particularly for contract that be award without competition my hon friend make an important point about samuel pepys my diplomatic answer would be that defence procurement have perhaps be subject to spiral development for long than we think my hon friend make an important point about value for money particularly for single source stress that the change will come into force at the same time as we be also reform single source regulation will soon have the great pleasure of bring forward statutory instrument which will make number of change to single source regulation to ensure that they be optimise they be good way of ensure that the inevitable single source procurement that we will always have in defence not least in highly sensitive area or where there be one specialist supplier be as effective as possible he make very good point welcome the statement particularly the new thinking around factoring export for the future into defence acquisition and procurement thank the minister for his recent visit to shropshire would he like to put on the record his thank to all the fantastic defence engineer man woman and apprentice who work at rheinmetall bae systems land and the defence support group babcock which be deliver for defence and keep we safe at home and abroad would he perhaps like to hint at new job and new contract in shropshire up to my right hon friend be an absolute champion of defence job in his constituency in shropshire be delighted to visit rbsl in telford which be make not only boxer but challenger two of the three key component of our future armoured combat battlegroup it be pleasure to meet the apprentice and other worker and to see the reality behind those job that we often talk of as statistic babcock be also an important employer in his constituency will say to he that the opportunity will be there not only through our own procurement but through put exportability at the heart of procurement to ensure that we sustain our industrial base for as long as possible by give it the wide possible market point of order on point of order mr deputy speaker have inform the relevant member of my raise this point of order on january the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip steve tuckwell ask the prime minister an oral question about hillingdon hospital in his constituency he say that the new hillingdon hospital have full planning permission and full funding and enable work be well under way official report january vol however freedom of information request have reveal that the total funding for the redevelopment of hillingdon hospital be to be confirm far understand that the start date for the procurement of contractor and for the construction of the hospital be yet to be confirm give that the hon gentleman may have unintentionally mislead the house on matter of great concern to his constituent seek your assistance mr deputy speaker in ask he to set the record straight on this matter thank the hon lady for her point of order and for give forward notice of it she have clearly make public her view on this matter while be not responsible for the content of members question draw the matter to the

net zero question since then my office have discover that price in chesterfield be now the same as they be in sheffield or very slightly less so want to give credit to the supermarket who appear to have put in place the change that be need say that chesterfield motorist be be overcharge but they no long be which be very happy thing so take this opportunity to correct the record can see motorist speed towards well perhaps not speed but head towards the hon member constituency to fill up when someone unintentionally mislead the house that be how to correct the record with speed thank the hon gentleman for that on point of order mr deputy speaker today report that thames water have be lobby the government and ofwat to let it increase bill and face low fine come as the company seek to avoid

have care for someone with brain tumour know how bad thing be and know that if we try something different we can give people diagnose with this deadly disease some hope this be my something different no be the pharmaceutical industry dr paul mulholland be europe lead medical oncologist in glioblastoma he believe that we be on the cusp of cure and he would like to run clinical trial so that he can turn that belief into reality but the pharmaceutical industry have refuse to donate the drug he need for those trial to take place that be because glioblastoma be very small market for those company with only people diagnose each year the investment be just not profitable there be not much money in it and the company be not interested that be why as policymaker it be our job either to encourage or to force the pharmaceutical company to provide the drug for these trial will give just one example in october meet moderna to ask if it could donate medicine for clinical trial of patient have hop that it would give clinical access to its mrna pipeline to help find cure but it refuse this company with annual sale of billion refuse to donate drug for people at maximum cost of half million pound these drug could save thousand of life each year so moderna refusal be shameful the house will be interested to hear that moderna have publish an environmental social and governance statement on its website that say it have responsibility to the multitude of patient our technology could help regardless of whether they have disease share by million or one that be unique to they alone the statement say that moderna understand what our stakeholder expect from we as sustainable responsible business and leader in mrna medicine those word be clearly meaningless do not mean to sound pessimistic because some company have be very supportive have have wonderful conversation with roche but where company such as moderna have the fund and the medicine but lack the will to find cure for brain tumour think it be the government duty to step in and legislate to ensure that they do the second difference be about regulation we need to ensure that our regulator incentivise the pharmaceutical industry and clinician to do as many clinical trial as possible right now the pharmaceutical industry see the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency and the national institute for health and care excellence as barrier as reason not to do clinical trial in the uk that need to change for starter when pharmaceutical company be trialle drug for glioblastoma and another disease such as melanoma the mhra should allow it to submit its datum separately so that glioblastoma patient result do not adversely affect the application funding treatment as package have be major impediment to the industry we can solve this issue if nice fund each drug use in the treatment of glioblastoma separately we will make progress if we make those change but we should not stop there we need whole host of policy change if we want to make change if we carry on with the same old process we will get the same old result which in the case of brain tumour research be failure we also need target of get glioblastoma patient each year into clinical trial on drug that have the potential to change the course of the disease we need the nhs to ensure that every neuro oncology multidisciplinary team have medical oncologist as core member so that brain tumour patient be not leave in corner of the ward because there be nobody to fight for they the nhs should make it easy for optometrist to directly refer patient straight to for scan without go through their gp on monday meet the anticancer fund which be base in brussels and think have discover the one benefit of brexit brexit mean that the nhs medicine repurpose programme have be able to identify drug that be initially purpose to cure another cancer and that be exactly what we need to tackle brain tumour the nhs should require that every doctor train to be medical oncologist go through mandatory course on brain tumour which take to my final recommendation in after tessa jowell sadly pass away from glioblastoma million of government funding be promise to fund research into brain tumour as of january just million of that million have be award that be real failure of government the mhra should be shout loud and proud about how much money be available for investment in brain tumour treatment but it do not and can not understand why for as long as there be no progress and be member will come back to the house at every opportunity come into politic to fight for people who be not hear and there be few people hear less than those who suffer from glioblastoma question put and agree to order that dame siobhain mcdonagh will quince george freeman tracey crouch steve brine helen hayes paul blomfield sarah owen dame meg hillier daisy cooper and wes streeting present the bill dame siobhain mcdonagh accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday april and to be print bill your campaign be one of margaret legacy thank you siobhain pedicabs london bill lords second reading beg to move that the bill be now read second time it be pleasure and privilege to move the motion on second reading for this bill which tackle an issue that have plague london road for far too long without shadow of doubt the bill have long and chequer history in get to this stage and legislator have be call for legislation on the issue for over year it be unquestionably the case that in the law commission commence its programme of law reform which include review of the legal framework relate to this space that be publish on may and it recommend bring pedicab within the scope of taxi and private hire regulation successive mayors include the present mayor have support regulation in this space the previous mayor of london mr boris johnson call in for transport for london to have the power to remove pedicab that do not meet rigorous safety and licensing standard an independent task and finish group on taxi and private hire vehicle licensing be subsequently commission by the government in september the minister be make very good point about the cross party support from both labour mayor and conservative mayor do he agree that it be important to recognise that the pedicab industry have also call for proper regulation the london pedicab operators association write to to say that it be in accord with the universal view that pedicabs must be fairly and appropriately regulate fast do the minister agree that it be important to do it now anyone who have see this particular problem on the street of london will accept that there be clear public demand for pedicab and that there be organisation that want to have regulate safe pedicab on the street of london my hon friend be right to say that the industry wish to be regulate so that the good actor can be support so that people can have trust in this industry although it be small and so that the rogue actor will come on to they in bit more detail be not only discouraged but prevent from operate in this way we have to be blunt about some of the particular example and this have significant and real impact on the tourist industry in this country on woman health in particular but also that of general member of the public and on the potential commission of crime some of the bad example include tourist charge more than for seven minute mile journey with their two child another charge for minute journey between mayfair and soho and one hit with bill for three minute journey fortunately on that occasion the driver be order to return the money by local police and westminster city council the truth be that the task and finish group have be seek space for safe and responsible pedicab trade the quote that be set out in the house of commons guidance say that there have be much justify criticism in recent year of rogue pedicab operator take advantage of tourist with excessive charge and absence of safety check and it go on it be not acceptable that transport for london be unable to regulate pedicab to ensure safe service the government announce in that it would rectify this and the legislation should be bring forward as soon as possible that be say in subsequently in the government make it crystal clear that they support the bill there have be various attempt to bring this matter forward and let we be blunt this be thin bill deal with niche issue but it be something that genuinely do matter such issue be traditionally often handle by way of private member bill and various colleague have try to bring this matter forward by way of private member bill start with my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully will my hon friend give way as have just name my hon friend will be delighted to give way be grateful to the minister for give way and he be as ever make an excellent speech do he agree that the mayor the council resident business parliament largely and the pedicab industry itself agree with simply change century legislative anomaly in order for the only form of public transport in london that be not regulate to come under that banner do he agree that this could and should have be do year ago and that it should be do easily now my hon friend will know that pedicab be effectively stage carriage under the metropolitan public carriage act with which we be all deeply familiar be quite sure that mean they be the only unregulated form of public transport operate on london road he be right to highlight that this have cross party support across london as well as support from variety of mayors and local authority it have the support of the business industry and those who want to be part of regulated pedicab industry tourist visit london who step into pedicab should not believe face the risk of an inappropriate fare an unlicensed driver who have have no background check and vehicle with potentially no safety standard sadly that be fairly regularly the case would we not have have regulatory regime have the licensed taxi drivers association not be campaign openly and publicly for ban pedicab altogether rather than regulate they say with real genuine respect for my hon friend be his whip for while who clearly have strong view on these matter that although the london taxi driver may have view have unregulated provider on the street of london who be clearly in some sad case abuse tourist and have very bad reputation rip people off to the tune of for couple of minute journey do not give good image of london there have be attempt under successive government to tackle this issue by way of private members bills which be often how small legislation be often deal with in this place the taxi driver do not have anything fundamentally to fear from regulated pedicab industry because regulated pedicab exist in other city and it be not the case that anybody be try to take away unfair competition the taxi driver have be regulate in perfectly appropriate way by successive government on cross party basis and we want they to thrive and exist and provide the service they do to londoners and tourist alike be the minister aware that at meeting with licensed taxi driver at city hall on january bob oddy refer to video produce by the ltda ban do license and the ltda be campaign not for registration of pedicab but for complete ban will the government commit to ensure pedicab be not regulate out of existence there be quite lot to unpick from that question on event of year ago but will do my good first the government do not want to regulate any particular part of the sector out of existence and in fact pedicab exist elsewhere secondly be absolutely confident that we can have situation in which people be charge an appropriate fee for what be physical activity charge for cycle someone around the flattish street of london be fairly simple stuff and pedicab operator get proper return for their endeavour while make sure the cost be not for five minute it be perfectly possible for we to create proper market where there be safety check in the usual way without pedicab no long be in existence the point be answer by my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken as she rightly point out number of pedicab operator want to get rid of the bad actor so they can thrive there be nothing fundamentally wrong with that there really be not there be space in the great city of london for the black cab industry the private motor vehicle industry in the form of private hire and pedicabs all three can and should co exist along with all the bus the tube and the like agree with the minister about the mixture of transport mode we enjoy in london and people should also be able to enjoy that across the rest of the nation bring we forward to the last few year as oppose to when chair transport committee on the london assembly in we look at accessibility and ensure access to different transport mode in the capital do the minister agree that by bring forward this legislation and help transport for london to set the regulation we will have license pedicab with clear operator allow for licence duration fee suspension and clear charging which will help pedicab add to the mix of transport mode in london it be hard to disagree with those point but accept that my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope have concern and want to try to try to address some of his point this be not something that just one side of the house be seek all part of the house be seek it as have successive mayors include mr boris johnson late of this parish who enthusiastically support it accept entirely that some may have concern about transport for london not be part of the government as such but successive mayors of different political persuasion have be happy for tfl to run this appropriate regulation the hon lady touch on variety of point but clearly there be other issue such as noise the persistent and ongoing blocking of footpath which unquestionably have significant issue for accessibility and the general causing of nuisance without shadow of doubt there be plentiful example to show why this measure have be call for on repeat basis and why the government should act in this space be not against this bill but would like some general reassurance from the minister be not the sort of conservative who believe in more regulation particularly when it come to young entrepreneur provide fairly simple service for tourist can he assure that when this regulation come into force it will be light touch and not onerous so that we do not kill this young and perfectly acceptable industry be perfectly happy to be reassure just want the minister to do that for the answer be yes and yes the key point be that as this be totally unregulated market it be hard to be precise as to how many people be provide this service on daily or weekly basis in london it be in the several hundred rather than the thousand those who wish to take this industry seriously and do thing properly unquestionably feel that they can run young entrepreneurial business with proper reputation and the right amount of enthusiasm and aspiration in truly conservative way and also provide safe service in which tourist can have confidence genuinely believe that that be the case if it matter that there be strong recommendation that the measure will be appropriate but light touch be happy to provide that from this dispatch box have go on for long than intend but genuinely believe that the bill will ensure that the pedicab industry be respectable safe and regulate in an appropriate fashion and that it bring the same accountability to this industry that we rightly expect in great capital city that be rightly tourist hotspot and we wish to continue to support that the bill be support by londoners councillor and member of parliament and there be no question but that be happy to commend it to the house it be pleasure to speak for the opposition on second reading this afternoon as my colleague in the other place have set out labour welcome this short yet vital bill and will support its progress but it be long overdue after year of ask for these power from the government the bill will finally give transport for london the power to tackle the blight of unregulated pedicab in london largely in the city west end as colleague will know all too well pedicab have be able to operate without regulation for decade due to legal loophole in london they be not consider taxi under the current law and be instead define as stage carriage under section of the metropolitan public carriage act however with section no long in force completely unregulate pedicab industry have emerge in london indeed as the minister infer it be the only form of unregulated public transport in the capital between and pedicab operator incident be report in london include six sexual offence and injury cause collision pedicab have also be notorious for egregious overcharging of tourist as of course they be currently entirely free to determine their own fare sometimes seemingly at random as the minister reference tourist with two young child be charge more than for seven minute journey in pedicab the driver intimidate the tourist into immediate payment and then disappear presumably to avoid be report this be just one of many concern report of unacceptable behaviour from unlicensed operator it be clear that tfl urgently need the power necessary to regulate and be pleased that the bill will go long way in make pedicab safe for passenger because it be this emphasis on safety that be so vital know that the minister and agree that we do not want pedicab ban from london street we just want they to be as well regulate on safety as any other mode of public transport be grateful to my hon friend for give way he be speak very eloquently also welcome the word from the minister this afternoon do my hon friend agree that there be very similar situation with other new form of transport such as scooter and motorbike hopefully there can be similar discussion about the safety issue and about balance the need for new form of transport against the safety of pedestrian perhaps he can say few word about the need for the government to look at that issue as their next objective in this area of transport policy agree with my hon friend would have like to have see the government hold to their promise of deliver comprehensive transport bill thing such as scooter need decision one way or the other we can not extend the trial indefinitely regulated pedicab sector can bring enormous benefit to london as unique zero carbon way to travel in an equally unique thrive part of london with bustling night time economy indeed sustainable pedicab industry can be in keep with the treasured colourful unique character of the west end while also ensure that regulation be in place to keep passenger safe be pleased that the bill have reach this chamber in much improved state thank to the hard work of colleague in the other place notably labour lord in particular we welcome that the government have concede on ensure that the power to regulate be entirely devolve to transport for london rather than the time consume and unnecessary step of require parliamentary approval such requirement would have be anomalous compare with tfl wide power on private hire regulation or indeed with other combine authority regulatory power for that reason we welcome the government removal of subsection of clause and the insertion of clause on guidance from the secretary of state instead additionally we warmly welcome the government decision to amend clause to make provision for regulation on noise nuisance which be key concern that stakeholder have be raise for year that be say as positive as the bill be the government have take far too long to get to this point transport for london westminster city council the local government association and various night time economy trade association have be call for action on pedicab for year and for year the government repeatedly promise action with private member bill even be propose on the same topic by government mps the reality be that this legislation be desperately overdue and should have be part of much more comprehensive transport bill local council industry body and manufacturer alike be cry out for clarity from the government on scooter and bike regulation for instance but the government seem to refuse to take this opportunity to make progress in this area none the less the bill be important in its own term and be pleased that tfl power to regulate on this issue will be on the statute book in due course key issue that many stakeholder include the licensed taxi drivers association and transport for london have raise be make pedicab operator eligible for enhanced disclosure and barring service check in line with taxi and private hire driver know that that be raise by several colleague in the other place where the minister say that the government be look into it would be grateful if the minister could provide an update and say whether we can explore that in committee because this be an opportunity to ensure that passenger safety be as robust as possible overall this be much need but desperately overdue bill look forward to work with the minister and other colleague as the bill progress perhaps more than most here today welcome the second reading of the pedicabs london bill it do seem to be groundhog day for as this will be the third time since enter parliament in that have stand in this chamber and speak on second reading to highlight the need for licensing scheme for pedicab in london madam deputy speaker you and other in and outside parliament could be forgive for wonder why on earth the government have give time for this small bill one would expect that it should become law via private member bill as the minister mention it should have do as four attempt have be make via private member bill to introduce pedicab license scheme in london one be make by my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully second by my predecessor mark field and since enter parliament have twice promote private member bill on pedicab licensing but because of the way such bills fall due to single objection mine have fail therefore be truly grateful for what the government have do first under the former prime minister boris johnson who be behind the wish to secure pedicab legislation he agree with the then transport secretary my right hon friend the member for welwyn hatfield grant shapps to put clause in the plan transport bill which fall when mr johnson resign then start my lobbying from scratch and meet no official from the current administration to make the case for pedicab legislation to be give government time would like to put on record my thank to people from across parliament who have provide help particularly baroness stowell of beeston who support my campaign to lobby ministers and their special adviser would also like to put on record my thank and admiration for the two special adviser james nation and will tanner who accept that we need to introduce pedicab regulation without they we would not be here today and thank they the minister and the transport secretary for understand the reason why we need this legislation do not know for certain whether we would get government time for this legislation so when stand in the other place and hear his majesty announce bill will be introduce to deal with the scourge of unlicensed pedicab in london you could have knock over with feather it be fair to ask why we need this legislation at all first wish to point out that this bill do not and will not propose to ban pedicab from the street of london it be about improve the condition for driver and passenger firmly believe that if we could have properly regulate pedicab they could offer very positive and special visitor experience understand that pedicab regulation already exist in this country and where it do in place such as oxford york and salisbury we still see pedicab but they provide much well offer it be clear that the regulation of pedicab do not mean their eradication my hon friend will have see as have the briefing from cycling uk do she recall that it say even where local authority have be keen to support local would be pedicab operator as have happen in oxford salisbury and york they have be unable to operate on ply for hire basis because the local taxi operator who view they as competition start ask question about whether the pedicabs and their operator have the same insurance etc pedicabs have not be able to operate in those area outside london because of the opposition from the licensed taxi driver thank my hon friend for that point as far as be concern cycling uk have support this bill have have several meeting with cycling uk and believe my hon friend may have be involve in some of those meeting previously it have always understand why want to bring in this bill it be important to make the point that the driver and vehicle must be safe there have be too many instance where police operation and operation in conjunction with westminster city council have find driver who be unfit to be take passenger include those who be want for serious crime such as sexual violence crime believe that one person be even find to be want for murder do the hon lady agree that this regulation be not just about ensure fair and transparent fare model because tfl will have the option to ensure that those driver undergo criminal check and that they have the right to work in the uk thank the hon lady for her intervention as it come to the crux of why want to introduce this legislation want to make these vehicle safe not only through ensure that they be pass mot and be fit to be on the street but by ensure that the driver be safe again as result of the operation that the police and westminster city council have undertake over the year we have find asylum seeker who have not get the right to work drive these pedicab and we have find illegal immigrant who have not get the right to work here let we not forget that those people be also be exploit one reason it be important to have regulate pedicab be that it will ensure that driver have right we also have to ensure that we have regulated fair system in place operator must adhere to the highway code and not play blaring music at all hour of the day and night it be time that pedicab in london be regulate as black cab ubers and private hire vehicle be hear what my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope say about what the licensed taxi drivers association say year ago in my own meeting in the last couple of year taxi driver have be very clear that they want level playing field they do not expect pedicab to be ban they just want they to be as safe as black cab why should black cab driver have to jump through so many hoop to get on the road when pedicab driver can literally get on pedicab go on to the street of westminster and ply for trade it can not be right and we have to ensure that the whole system be fair just and legal part of my constituency include soho covent garden marylebone and fitzrovia can become like the wild west it become the wild west end at time because of the sheer number of pedicab on the street too many play extraordinarily loud music often block road and pavement disrupt resident and business and have poor track record of exploit london tourist be extremely grateful for the wide range of support that have have for secure pedicab regulation from local people across the two city from resident association such as the soho society the marylebone association and the covent garden community association and from business include the hippodrome heart of london business alliance and the new west end company also thank roger geffen from cycling uk chris dixon from pedal me and friedel schroder from the london pedicabs operators association who have be on this journey with and always provide with the information and support for what intend to do the reason pedicab be not regulate in london as we have hear can be trace back to the fact that under the metropolitan public carriage act pedicab in greater london be define as stage carriage modern legislation have not correct the issue and thus pedicab do not fall under transport for london license power as result pedicab be currently the only form of public transport that be not regulate in london the bill correct that clearly outline that to attain licence to operate pedicab operator must adhere to several requirement pertain to their pedicab the requirement relate to the road worthiness and cleanliness of pedicabs safety and insurance the type of equipment that must be carry onboard the appearance and marking of pedicab and the conduct of pedicab operator must thank the noble member of the other place where the bill begin its parliamentary journey who have improve the bill and ensure that it be as watertight as possible put on record my gratitude to the transport minister lord davies of gower for his excellent stewardship of the bill through the other place and for join and today minister my hon friend the member for hexham guy opperman on visit to leicester square on sunday evening to see the situation for himself be sure that it be enjoyable and different ministerial visit than they be both use to in that time we see four pedicab block pavement which would have prevent an emergency vehicle be it an ambulance fire engine or police vehicle from enter leicester square have there be an incident pedicabs have to be properly regulate to ensure that the public be safe the other place have tighten up the definition of pedicab to prevent any adjustment from be make to pedicab to get around the licensing requirement not only will the bill ensure that the conduct of operate pedicab be regulate but it will provide transport for london which will operate the licensing scheme with the power to implement proper fair system like the one for black cab and ubers rip off fare from pedicab be constant theme in my inbox and in medium coverage thank the hon lady for make such powerful speech on why we need regulation be she aware of the bbc democracy report on its undercover work look at the fee charge one pedicab charge flat fee of per minute and another reportedly close to for minute ride do she not think that that be an extortionate rip off absolutely agree and thank the hon lady for her point the bbc democracy report be fascinating about some pedicab driver although must make the very important point that not all pedicab driver be rogue there be brilliant organisation and company such as pedal have work with chris dixon the founder which be an outstanding pedicab company that look after its driver properly and its vehicle want all pedicab to be like that the bbc democracy report however show that some pedicabs driver be be use for drug dealing and take people to brothel where they deserve what happen if they go to some very dodgy club that be why we have to regulate and ensure that driver be fit to carry passenger and that they be legally able to work in this country more than anything such pedicab fare be in the medium constantly especially when pedicab operator take advantage of vulnerable tourist enjoy the incredible cultural offer of the west end constituent who come across one such tourist incident write to the pedicab operator get very aggressive when the americans refuse to pay for journey from trafalgar square to great smith street which be journey of mile welcome the bill provide transport for london with power to set what fare can be charge when and how passenger must be make aware of the fare and what method of payment be acceptable perhaps the most popular part of the bill for my constituent be the provision on rider conduct which thank to the other place have be strengthen to include noise limit the frustration local people often face due to the loudspeaker many pedicab carry be well sum up by constituent who tell have no choice but to listen to music hour after hour day after day and often until the early hour of the morning they be leave in situ able to do it as they all know the council and the police have no power to stop they be therefore pleased to see the other place strengthen the bill ability to tackle unreasonable noise level by add noise restriction to the conduct requirement that operator must meet in order to keep their licence the hon lady may know that number of pedicabs congregate outside st thomas hospital in my constituency where patient be recover from lifesave treatment do she agree that have that noise blare out in the early hour of the morning be totally unreasonable it be completely unreasonable the hon lady make good point not only hospital be affect hotel be lose business if pedicab be outside hotel in the west end at in the morning and do not move for hour patron rightly complain and ask for their money back this be not just about resident and hospital patient but about business lose money be pleased about the noise level be add to the restriction as my constituent rightly point out pedicab can get away with act like that because there be no power to contain they the pedicabs london bill will bring that to an end hope those operator who do not adhere to their new licence term can be give fix penalty notice if the conduct of operator do not improve after that transport for london reserve the right to demobilise seize and dispose of pedicab that contravene the regulation that will make huge difference finally will touch on the role of transport for london put on the record my sincere thank to will norman the mayor of london walk and cycling commissioner he have work closely with on my private member bills and have be huge advocate for pedicab regulation note that in the other place an amendment be table to allow the department for transport to provide transport for london with statutory guidance on pedicab regulation agree with that and welcome the fact that the government have accept that amendment tfl be the correct body to oversee regulation as it currently regulate licensing for all other taxi and private hire it may have take four private member bills an abandon transport bill and year of lobbying and campaigning by politician from across the political divide but be confident that the pedicabs london bill will finally become law the street of london will be safe and we will have safe and thriving pedicab industry it be an honour to follow my constituency neighbour the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken thank she for her work in bring the bill to this stage and pay tribute to member for the cross party support that it have receive the bill be support by the mayor of london by my borough council lambeth council by westminster city council by the royal borough of kensington and chelsea and by hon member from across the political divide share westminster bridge with the hon member for cities of london and westminster half the bridge be in vauxhall the other half be in the city of westminster regularly cross the bridge on my way to work need not tell any member that that bridge can be busy you literally have to fight to get across it in some case for your life want the bridge to be busy because that mean that tourist be come to london our night time economy be thrive my constituency on the south bank be see those visitor come and spending and people be support our local business it mean that people be able to thrive and that be what we want it be what make london unique so it be important that we celebrate the fact that more and more people be come to westminster bridge and part of central london however we also want people to have good experience in that case why be there still proliferation of unlicensed market stall sell hot dog and block the pavement with impunity on the lambeth side of westminster bridge continually raise that issue with the lambeth north safe neighbourhood policing team with lambeth council and rightly with the met police commissioner have say to the commissioner on number of occasion that yes there be many major policing challenge in london but that activity be blight on key part of london that receive so many tourist there be also the crime element of those thing through work with the safe neighbourhood team lead by sergeant watson we have see number of prosecution in recent month and hope that with more support and funding for our police officer we can eradicate that activity for good pedicab be part of the experience for many visitor to london the bill main purpose be not to ban they outright but we can not deny that with their current unregulated status they be create serious risk and problem for tourist resident the road network and as the hon member for cities of london and westminster highlight for the driver themselves currently someone get into pedicab have no clear idea of what they be get into they do not know how safe the driver be how roadworthy the pedicab be or how often it have be clean not only be that dangerous for everyone on board it also disadvantage those who spend money maintain their pedicab only to see their hard work trust and investment damage by those who continue to take risk it be right that clause and give transport for london the power to create clear safety and cleanliness standard so that people can trust that the pedicab they be use be not dangerous also welcome the amendment to clause make in the other place confess that when be drive sometimes like listen to music will not tell you my choice of music madam deputy speaker but it range from beyoncé and the spice girls to taylor swift and usher raymond we know that when it come to pedicab music can also be part of the experience it go long way but have have constituent complain about the loud music from pedicab and the noise nuisance that they create in residential area as the hon member for cities of london and westminster also outline it be right that we give tfl the power to act on that while lot of our focus may be on the problem customer face in pedicab it be also right that we look at the work condition of their driver many driver find themselves be exploit they work long hour and tiring shift in close proximity to extremely loud music and let be honest some face abuse from customer with very little protection it be therefore right that clause allow provision to be make relate to the work condition of driver hope that be not forget when tfl draft the regulation like many people also welcome clause which relate to how fare be advertise charge and pay for we have hear many story and anecdote of how those fare be not fair do not think any of we expect that pedicabs will or should become cost effective way of travel around our capital and it be clear that many people get into pedicab do so because of the wild and wacky experience they offer those light can sometimes be quite attractive especially when the pedicab have pink fluffy feather as well but there be big difference between pay premium for an experience and frankly be exploit as the minister touch on the bbc report in july on belgian tourist who be charge for mile long ride when she complain the driver demand immediate payment make she feel really threaten do we think any tourist who have have that experience will want to come back do we think they be go to tell their friend and family come to london when this be what can happen this be not about just one egregious case as we have hear there be many other case of such exploitation many tourist have be advertise trip between the like of westminster bridge just outside this place and trafalgar square without know how close they be and rightly feel cheated when they be charge for minute journey know that london be expensive but come on that be just rip off it be right that we recognise that pedicab may charge that little bit extra for those pink flashing light and the music but we must strike the right balance between premium and be rip off london should be one of the good city in the world to be tourist but our current lax regulation around pedicabs destroy not only their image but that of our rightfully robust standard in other sector and the experience of the uk as whole at present tfl be unable to act to help ensure pedicab safety include for passenger and their fair and transparent operation in city of almost million people pedicab be the only form of unregulated public transport in the capital this bill will allow tfl to set standard for operator and ensure that driver undergo robust criminal check as the hon member for cities of london and westminster have highlight it be long overdue and it be necessary to allow pedicab to be positive part of the london transport network it be pleasure to participate in this debate be grateful to the minister for have indicate in his remark that he be open to discussion and persuasion on what hope will be some useful amendment that can be table to improve the bill when it reach its committee and report stage see that it will be refer to committee of the whole house rather than public bill committee that be just as well because if it be go to be deal with in committee upstairs be sure that would never be select by the committee of selection which be control by the government to participate in it this bill be really an allegory for this parliament we have thousand of illegal immigrant on our street who have jump bail or get rid of their tag rogue parking operator who the government have be try to deal with for year and year bike run amok and cause mammoth problem for pedestrian in london and all sort of other obstruction of the highway by protester make it very difficult for people visit london particularly at the weekend to go about their lawful business it be an allegory for this parliament that it have choose prime time on wednesday to discuss the burn issue of pedicab interruption can not hear what my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken say from sedentary position my hon friend be make an interesting speech but would he agree that we could and should have do this back in when my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken be the leader of westminster council and introduce my private member bill we could have get it do on friday afternoon we could have get this do much soon than that we could have get it do in about when transport for london bring forward private bill include provision to deal with this matter however in that bill and in subsequent bills we have always encounter the difficulty that transport for london have be unwilling do not think it be unable but it be unwilling to produce any draft regulation so we be be ask to approve potential legislation that be blind as to what would be contain in it it be interesting be it not that all these year have go by and one might have expect by now that transport for london would have document with detailed draft regulation for pedicab but it have not get anywhere near that indeed when be privileged to be invite to meeting that my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster organise it be clear at the meeting that transport for london be unable to produce any draft and be unable to say how long it would be before it would produce one it be unwilling to produce draft to inform debate on the private member bill that my hon friend be promote so be it surprising that there be lot of suspicion around this issue people think that the ulterior motive of transport for london be to regulate pedicab out of existence obviously we can say that that be not the intention and all the rest of it but if the consequence of this legislation be that pedicab will be extinct in few year time we as legislator should be ask whether we really want that situation to arise certainly do not want that situation to arise and be concerned that there have be lot of misrepresentation about the extent of the support for the bill in principle there be support for the bill because all the regular pedicab operator would love to have light regulatory regime to get rid of the rogue on the street let we go back to the history of the bill and the proposal from many different politician from across party organisation and business improvement district right across london and the council in the borough of london do the hon member believe that they as representative of london speak for their resident and business would see why we need this bill see that absolutely have already refer to that london assembly transport committee scrutiny report on the future of london pedicab which be publish in february in that report that committee make it quite clear that it be in favour of very light regulation of pedicab not the heavy handed regulation that seem to be envisage at the moment and that be certainly fear by organisation such as cycling uk the hon member keep cite the report do he appreciate that year on the transport system in london have move on be more diverse and be more accessible do he agree that regulate these pedicab will help improve the transport network for resident business and tourist come to london alike think the jury be out say that because transport for london have discretion to decide for example whether to introduce mph zone we know that it also have discretion over whether to outlaw vehicle of particular type such as diesel vehicle or to introduce ultra low emission zone it have that discretion but many people live in london particularly outer london where they be dependent on their car or van for go about their normal business think that transport for london have abuse its power indeed they have ask the government to intervene and that be the message that come out of the uxbridge and south ruislip by election which the hon lady may remember be transport for london to be trust the short answer be that it have not behave responsibly on the extension of the ulez charge across the whole conurbation how do we know it be to be trust on this if we give it blank cheque on which to write do the hon gentleman agree with lifelong londoner that some of the measure he have outline such as mph limit ulez and the congestion charge be all benefit to help improve transport in london and air quality we have major issue with air quality when we step out from this building on to westminster bridge in my constituency the air quality be quite bad we have major issue we be try to get more people to be active and to use public transport but that will only happen if measure such as the one he have outline be introduce with the support of londoners the council and resident in london do he agree be afraid do not agree with everything that the hon lady be say but agree about the desirability of have emission free form of transport in london and one such emission free form of transport be the pedicab do not understand why the hon lady seem to be rely on transport for london legislate with heavy hand to exclude that sort of activity thank my hon friend for give way and hope the house will forgive for have to leave the chamber for few minute do he agree that what this law be try to do be ensure not only that pedicabs become regulate like every other form of public transport but that they be treat in london as they be in every other part of the country they be stage carriage in london but everywhere else they be hansom cab which mean they can be regulate everywhere apart from london the regulated pedicabs coalition bring together the licensed taxi drivers association which he mention early in an intervention as well as casino hospitality business and resident group in westminster that want this bill to happen so that we have pedicab on the street but regulated one hope that my hon friend will make his own speech in due course because know he believe passionately about this issue may just refer he and other member to the briefing from cycling uk my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster refer in her opening remark to roger geffen the policy director for cycling uk the briefing he have produce have section entitle beyond the bill the need for national regulatory framework for pedicab it state as thing currently stand pedicab can operate in london under legislation date from which permit the operation of stage carriages conversely in the rest of great britain outside london pedicab have to operate under the same legal framework as taxi this make it almost impossible in practice for pedicab to operate on ply for hire basis outside london because the insurance and other requirement for taxi be so onerous and be entirely disproportionate for address the potential risk even where local authority have be keen to support local would be pedicab operator those pedicab operator have not be able to start up because of the weight of regulation make that point in an intervention on the minister roger geffen then state that it be potentially valuable that the secretary of state will now be able to issue guidance to tfl but that it would be great if that guidance could in future be extend to other non london licensing authority at such time as new regulatory framework be put in place for license taxi and minicab he as cyclist be concern that this great method of transport pedal drive rickshaw be not be use outside london for the purpose of enable people to apply for hire and travel from one place to another that be why think the assertion that the bill aim not to regulate pedicab out of existence but merely to bring in regulatory regime that outlaw the most extreme example of bad behaviour be naive it be incumbent on transport to london to produce draft regulation as we have hear it have be at this for plus year and even as we speak it can not produce draft of the regulation it have in mind to introduce put out this challenge to transport for london which hope will be carry to it by my hon friend the minister do not know when the business manager will decide we will have the bill committee and report stage but before we get to committee it should bring forward draft of the regulation that it have in mind if it do that we will be able to see whether our fear and suspicion which be share by cycling uk be well found or wide of the mark that be perfectly reasonable way to proceed it be commonplace in the house to see draft regulation before we finalise legislation but there do not seem to be any appetite for that on the part of transport for london we have not even have an indication of the timescale in which transport for london wish to introduce the regulation how much long will the good pedicab operator of london have to wait before the lightweight regulation for which they have be campaign for so many year be introduce one of my suggestion be therefore that the government should recognise that in the rest of the country where different regulatory regime relate to pedicab they do not exist because they be regulate out of existence if the government wish to promote emission free form of transport such as pedicab why do they not get on and introduce guidance system for transport authority and local authority outside the london area so that they can take the burden of regulation off potential entrepreneur who wish to be able to provide pedicab service in city such as oxford salisbury and york as we have hear if such commitment from the government be to come out of the bill it would be really worthwhile exercise do not think that the government be right to be sit on the fence in relation to bike and scooter why be we concentrate on the small number of pedicab rather than the very much large number of bike and scooter which be cause mayhem for many resident live in london not to mention elsewhere in the country as be sure my hon friend know the use of scooter on the highway other than in certain pilot site be illegal therefore it be not really matter of regulation rather it be matter of enforcement many of we would love to see much more enforcement similarly on bike of which use to be regular user and owner my hon friend will know that there be significant regulation not least that they be speed limit to mph however many manufacturer have hide in their bike somewhere the ability to override that speed limiter similarly that be subject for enforcement rather than for regulation therefore although appreciate his point and agree with he do not think it be matter for legislation frankly in london and elsewhere it be more matter for the police my right hon friend be right so often in this place we find ourselves introduce new legislation because the legislation in place be not be enforce my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster do not mention this but be it not extraordinary that it take the city of westminster so long to start use power that it already have to control pedicab chaos as it put it to start prosecute rogue pedicab operator the city of westminster issue press release on december pride itself on successfully prosecute six pedicab operator in westminster magistrate court which result in fine near that show that law be already in place but they be not be adequately enforce as my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse say agree on the safety of bike tragically three year old be hit by an scooter on july in myatt field park in my constituency thankfully she do not die but she be leave with life change injury there be real issue about the safety of bike do the hon member agree that many pedicab obstruct cycle lane and cause danger and that be why we need clear regulation to ensure that they follow the highway code and the code of practice be very much in favour of regulation where it be necessary to take the hon lady own council lambeth recall read in national newspaper in the past few day that because it have not comply with regulation on street sign to prohibit entry into low traffic neighbourhood it have be able to fleece the motoring public of many million of pound interruption the hon lady be laugh but it be not funny to the motorist who have suffer and pay those high penalty it be not as though the money that lambeth have recover through those foul mean have be reinveste into improve the road network as someone who have the privilege if can call it that of live in lambeth can see with my own eye the poor state of the pavement and highway there what the hon gentleman be refer to as the minister know be the trial of low traffic neighbourhood in the constituency of my hon friend the member for streatham bell ribeiro addy off streatham high road that be still in its trial period and the council be consult on it do the hon gentleman agree that my local authority be have to scale back on the thing that it want to do because of the cut it have face over the past year it would be helpful be we lobby the chancellor on cross party basis to fund local government adequately will not be draw into the lambeth wandsworth comparison when be the leader of wandsworth council we help secure the low council taxis in london while lambeth have among the high the hon lady would be well advise to keep away from the efficiency or otherwise of lambeth council let revert to the subject matter this afternoon roger geffen briefing have draw attention to the definition of pedicab in clause which be pedicab mean pedal cycle or pedal cycle in combination with trailer that be construct or adapt for carry one or more passenger and be make available with driver for hire or reward the point make by cycling uk be that pedal cycle may be use for the delivery of good so why should it be control under the provision in the bill it may be use by somebody not ply for hire but take passenger in pedicab as result of hire agreement enter into not from public highway but as private agreement for example hotel and hospitality centre in london may wish to use the service of pedicab as privilege for their customer so they can visit the west end and not have to struggle on public transport while at the same time enjoy the fun of travel by pedicab why should pedicab in that situation be outlaw under the definition in the bill that be concern couple with that be the concern express that the plying for hire of pedicabs be too broadly draft because it exclude private hire but would not exclude private hire on definition in the bill relate to pedicab exclusively that be the detail relate to clause hope my hon friend the minister have look at the briefing from cycling uk because it be very balanced and well argue it reinforce the point make at the beginning of the debate cycling uk and the london pedicab operators association lpoa have be call for such framework for over year have it be put in place the wild west situation which now exist in london could have be avert however it need to be clear that the regulatory framework objective be to support safe and responsible pedicab sector and not potentially to kill it off the bill as draft contain no safeguard to assure we on this point if my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster can provide the safeguard that will be contain in the bill but be not in it at the moment be happy to give way interruption think she want to intervene but obviously she do not want to draw attention to the safeguard that cycling uk which she pray in aid as supporter early on say be miss from the bill my hon friend seem to be assert that they be in the current bill if that be the situation would like to see where they be would not have think that that be an unreasonable request hesitate to intervene but the position that use to exist be that the government be go to do the secondary regulation it be decide in the other place that it would be quick and well to do it through transport for london to criticise tfl when this be produce only in the last few week in the other place be little harsh give that that be not intend when the bill be originally publish it be clearly the case though that we continue to support the industry we can argue the toss on the briefing my hon friend refer to but can assure he that it be not our intention to as he put it regulate this particular industry out of existence accept what my hon friend say but if that be not the intention but it happen in practice that it be regulate out of existence what will the government do about it perhaps he will intervene and answer that question at the moment there be nothing in the bill to enable the situation to be rectify if tfl behave in the irresponsible way it have in relation to the ultra low emission zone and appease the licensed taxi drivers association and effectively outlaw pedicab in london what be go to be do about it hear no response but that be why proper safeguard must be write into the bill as for the minister point that transport for london have only just find out about its responsibility tfl propose its own legislation in and imagine that it have in mind exactly what it want to do when my hon friend the members for sutton and cheam paul scully and for cities of london and westminster produce their private member bills on this subject it be already clear that the regulation would be introduce by when we ask tfl what would be in they we be tell we have not the time or the inclination to start draft the regulation now even as we speak we do not know what the timescale be for the production of the regulation and the introduction of this regime be not sure whether the minister say that he have read roger geffen four page briefing but if he have not will happily share it with he after the debate in the briefing concern be express and certainly share that concern about the bill requirement for tfl to consult whoever it consider appropriate what be the point of that why not say something specific such as transport for london must consult organisation represent pedicab operator cyclist and pedestrian and other but include those at present the bill place no obligation on tfl to consult pedicab operator cyclist people involve in the hospitality industry and so on my understanding although the hon member for vauxhall florence eshalomi may be able to correct have carry out the role of transport committee chair at city hall be that tfl must undertake statutory consultation with all the relevant party include business and resident on any regulation that may be introduce if the bill be pass before this can become proper licensing regime be grateful to my hon friend because in that case be sure she will support an amendment or perhaps draft it herself to place on the face of the bill exactly what she have say at the moment the discretion as to who should be consult rest solely with tfl which think be ridiculous let expand little on the point be make about clause and the need for clarification of what be mean by power assist pedicab cycling uk believe that the potential pitfall could be avoid through reference to the electrically assisted pedal cycles regulations to define the vehicle that will be exempt from the legislative requirement for private hire vehicle hope that the minister will take that point on board cycling uk have make number of other suggestion it ask for instance what will happen about pedicab stand subclause of the bill currently provide for tfl to make regulation to limit the place time circumstance in which pedicab may ply for hire or operate order remind the hon gentleman that speeche on second reading should not go into huge detail about the various clause because that be obviously for committee be sure that he will return to the wide issue madam deputy speaker take your point completely but this be not situation where the bill will go into committee upstairs the committee will start with couple of evidence session with people who be interested in the bill and member of the committee will look at it this be situation where the government have on the order paper motion that all the remain stage should be deal with in three hour there be no indication as to how much time there will be between now and the time that those stage be timetable for this house therefore think it would be helpful if flag up in advance some of my concern about this bill to which be refer in this second read speech as you know madam deputy speaker second reading speech can extend to thing that be not include in the bill which be why be refer to thing that could be include in the bill but which be not currently include that be my intent that be extremely helpful the hon gentleman be very experienced and be on the panel of chairs and he understand lot about procedure although he be flag up issue too much detail about the clause would be inappropriate but be sure he be come back to his main point just remind he that have two other speaker to get in fortunately because there have not be much government business today we have reasonable period of time for discuss the bill to summarise the point be seek to make cycling uk say that the bill grant power for tfl to make regulation to limit this that and the other but there be no power to require tfl to provide place where pedicab can have stand again that seem to be rather asymmetrical or illiberal my final point be about the concern that cycling uk express about the need for consistency between civil offence relate to the use of pedicabs and motor vehicle cycling uk refer specifically to clause will not refer to that in detail take your advice madam deputy speaker but think there be sufficient meat in this bill for we to have very lively discussion in committee and on report however hope that in advance of that we will get clear view from the government and particularly from the minister about whether it be essentially their intent to stand by idly while give power to transport for london which do not exactly have good record on all this to exercise what the government hope will be its good intent to facilitate high quality pedicab regime in london we know jolly well that quite lot of the people who be concern about pedicab in the city stop short of actually ban they altogether or introduce regulation that would have exactly the same effect wholeheartedly welcome this legislation and the step take by the government to introduce licensing regime for the only form of transport in london that be still unregulated hope to see the development of the pedicabs industry across london provide employment and entrepreneurial opportunity as well as safe affordable and carbon free form of transport especially for those who be unable to utilise other form of active travel in order to ensure that regulation can promote the use of pedicab rather than merely suppress the negative aspect of the unregulated trade it be important to ensure that sufficient care and attention be pay to how such trade might operate the liberal democrats urge the government and tfl to ensure that the relevant council and user group such as the one in my constituency of richmond park be adequately consult to ensure that the new regime be effective and that regulation be implement as smoothly as possible my particular interest in pedicab arise from their use as means of transport in part of the capital that be currently close to motor traffic refer of course to hammersmith bridge in my constituency in particular we be shortly to mark the fifth anniversary of its closure to motor traffic although can assure the minister that this milestone will not be celebrate with any particular joy among the community of barnes east sheen or mortlake or indeed wider afield who have suffer ever since from the consequence of appal traffic congestion there have yet to be complete analysis of the full economic consequence to the capital of the continue closure of the bridge but even if there be one it could not encompass all the miss opportunity that my constituent have suffer the pass trade miss by small business in barnes the employment opportunity that could not be take up and the educational social and cultural event that have to be miss because people be unable to cross the river during the election campaign various conservative politician film themselves at the bridge promise to get it fix yet here we be star down the barrel of another general election and no progress have be make the government have remain shamefully silent on their plan to fix the bridge despite have be in possession of business case from hammersmith and fulham council for the past year however adversity breed innovation and my enterprise constituent in barnes have not sit by passively while be let down by the government in temporary pedicab service be put in place across hammersmith bridge by the barnes community association in the six month that it be operational the scheme carry more than people over the thames and be lifeline for those member of my constituency who can not access the shop hospital and other service in hammersmith while the bridge be closed this temporary scheme demonstrate that there be demand for transport across hammersmith bridge beyond cycling and walking especially among old people and those with limited mobility the ability to cross the bridge connect people with the economic and social opportunity deny to they by reliance on lengthy and increasingly unreliable bus route should this legislation pass urge minister to work with tfl to create new pedicab service across the bridge that could serve as model for other scheme in london have meet transport ministers official from the mayor office and local councillor all of whom express support for the idea and hope the minister will now publicly commit to work with tfl to renew effort to get pedicab service up and run across hammersmith bridge should this legislation be enact believe that if pedicab service could be put in place initially to serve those who wish to cross hammersmith bridge it could work as proof of concept to enable the service to be extend to other part of london where the promotion of active travel have be hinder by the need to cater for those with reduced mobility would like to acknowledge the contribution of liberal democrat colleague in the other place where this legislation originate particularly welcome the fact that this bill will provide the framework to address not only the noise pollution often cause by pedicab in london but the safety issue for both passenger and pedestrian that be often link to the driving of these vehicle far be pleased that we will be able to crack down on the extortionate fare often charge by pedicab there have be report of some journey of only minute result in fare of hundred of pound for the passenger this legislation will therefore be useful not just in enable the setting up of new pedicab scheme but in regulate those already in existence would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the outstanding work of liberal democrat london assembly member caroline pidgeon who have campaign for year on the issue of pedicab in our capital as well as be an effective voice for londoner on so many issue relate to crime and transport she have give great service to the people of london in her year as an assembly member and she will be much miss when she stand down in may this legislation be welcome step towards set up framework to regulate pedicab usage in london and the liberal democrats will be support the bill today my constituent in richmond park will particularly welcome the opportunity to make use of clean safe good value transport option to access the north side of the thames and hope that the government will continue to approach this legislation in an enable rather than suppress spirit my constituent be still demand answer on the long term future of the bridge and will continue to press for they but short term solution to the problem of access will none the less be welcome some year ago as emerge from one of the watering hole in soho that use to frequent before the child come along happen upon scene where an inebriated individual be stand in front of pedicab sway backwards and forwards as pass hear he say to the pedicab driver how much to guildford mate at which point there be an exchange that do not overhear the man get into the pedicab and off it go have no idea what happen to that poor chap or whether he make it to guildford in the pedicab from the fringe of leicester square but doubt it it occur to after the event that what probably happen as we have hear from other member be effectively sort of mug this chap in his relaxed state be likely to have be relieve of quite lot of money for service that he have stumble into in his confusion probably with sense of good humour adventure or desperation to get home it strike that we really need to do something about the pedicab system in central london do not want to detain the house too long feel like an snp member comment on legislation that affect only england in that like my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope there be no pedicab in my constituency although look forward to his amendment on report that would allow the relaxation of licensing so that pedicab can emerge in bournemouth and christchurch be sure that campaign will feature on his election leaflet come the big day later this year notwithstanding my imposing on the debate have antecedence in london as westminster councillor and deputy mayor for eight year support this bill for four reason first regard myself as an economic liberal think we should avoid as much regulation as possible to allow the private sector to flourish and frankly to allow grown adult to freely enter into contract between themselves however more important to be that in any industry or economic area there should be level playing field we have to accept that these vehicle operate in london by dint of strange loophole in rather ancient legislation when airbnb arrive in london in big way all the hotel which be very heavily regulated and have significant insurance and maintenance cost be right to complain that an unregulated competitor be enter the market and that the government have to take decision either you regulate airbnb the same as we or you regulate none of we and allow we all to compete fairly that notion of level playing field be key when be at city hall support the arrival in london of uber and other relate taxi service on the basis that there should be level playing field with the black cab service feel that if there be not level playing field black cab should have some privilege that uber and other do not have the job of the government or the regulatory authority be to balance those right privilege and regulation to make sure that all competition be fair at the moment as number of member have say it be not fair that pedicab be not regulate in the same way as other cab secondly although many of we love and cherish the slight chaos of the centre of our capital city it require order from time to time in particular it require order on the street anyone who drive in london on regular basis will know that it be hazardous at the good of time not least because the growth in cycling and the fact we now have to drive at mph mean there be lot of overtake and chaotic behaviour motorist have to keep their eye peel at all time for people suddenly swerve across the road very often take their life in their hand we need sense of order particularly in the densely build centre of town and it strike that these pedicab do not contribute to sense of order have have close shave with couple of pedicab over the year can say that they be often dangerously drive and badly park they block the road and pavement which as my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken say cause problem for emergency vehicle that need access to pedestrianise area we need sense of order and this bill will achieve that thirdly successful city centre and london be particularly successful city centre do not happen by accident they happen because they be curate when be westminster councillor at city hall we be very careful to preserve the ability of resident to live in central london and to ensure that the west end in particular should be mixed residential and commercial area that be key to its success and if there be sense of nuisance which many pedicab be will have hear about the music and the light and all the rest of it that will be just another straw break the camel back to drive the resident out of central london if we want the west end to stay vibrant and successful the powerhouse frankly of the economy that it be we can not allow it to turn into the city where there be no resident and it be dead after and there be no one there at the weekend that be just not the way to curate city centre curate city centre be an art as much as science and the municipal authority have an obligation to allow certain amount of chaos and scruff have lament the municipal domestos for example that have be pour over spitalfields by the city corporation it have destroy that asset for the city and it be now just another dull shopping centre fill with chain look to company such as soho estates which be great custodian of the area around soho square it carefully curate who occupy its property in order to maintain both the reputation and the character of soho as slightly louche shall we say part of the capital which all of we have enjoy from time to time mostly in our youth that curation require tool with which we can control some activity and that include pedicab the fourth reason support the legislation be the issue of crime there be unfortunately litany of story of crime be commit by people operate these cab whether rip off tourist put passenger in danger or use their pedicab to run drug they be not unrelated to the criminal fraternity and we need to be able to root out those people and have the control to remove they because in the end this be all about make money and if we remove they and leave space for the reputable operator we will have much well sense of safety for the public in central london acknowledge the hesitancy of my hon friend the member for christchurch about regulation and in normal circumstance would share it but we must bear in mind the notion of level playing field and of service that operate within the capital that be reputable around the world and do not feature on social medium for tourist in other country as one of the rip off they must avoid bit like how so many italian city be now advertise on social medium as infest with pickpocket we have to think about the reputation of our city internationally and indeed its impact nationally that be why be very keen to support this legislation and have be long stand supporter of this step since my time at city hall call shadow minister this have be an interesting debate some contribution have be interesting in good way some perhaps less so and there have be broad agreement with one exception that this bill be thoroughly good thing be pleased to see power finally be grant to transport for london to tackle the challenge and difficulty of unregulated pedicab which we have hear describe by number of member from across london in particular pay tribute to the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken for her work on this issue over many year and be grateful to she for quote the view of the london pedicab operators association and its call for regulation show that the industry itself be keen to see action on behalf of operator who want to do the right thing also congratulate the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully on finally get his dear wish grant and see this regulation come to fruition perhaps be overstate that but he have play part include through promote private member bill when my hon friend the member for vauxhall florence eshalomi be extoll the virtue of westminster bridge do wonder whether she be go to start quote william wordsworth earth have not anything to show more fair that is of course line that everybody be aware of but perhaps pedicab spoil the view very slightly she make good point about the threat to tourist and the importance of safety for passenger and indeed for driver which be include in the legislation she along with number of other member mention the noise nuisance as well my parliamentary twin the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse he and share the same date of birth finish the debate with what would loosely describe as an occasional dose of over disclosure about his own past but he make very good case for the legislation as well we have some disagreement from the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope who seem to think that this be sitting friday and that he should take his characteristic approach of talk out private member bill which be why as the minister point out we be here and the government have have to finally bring the bill forward the hon gentleman be be little unfair to my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope who make good point about our try to understand where this legislation could go as understand it tfl publish framework for licensing pedicab back in it might be helpful if the minister be to circulate that framework to member when we get to committee be grateful to the right hon member for his intervention the wide point be that the hon member for christchurch be raise thing that really belong in committee but he will have his chance to raise the matter that the right hon member mention as it will be committee of the whole house it be good news that we will close the legal loophole that exempt pedicab from be define as taxi under current law leave pedicab as the only form of unregulated public transport in london my hon friend the member for wakefield simon lightwood set out why labour view the bill as so important he address the case of overcharge we have have tfl own evidence of collision that involve pedicab result in personal injury there be driver incident between and the end of august include road obstruction driver conduct and six sexual offence those case alongside the overcharging and the noise nuisance demonstrate why it be so important that action be take to regulate pedicab we have an important opportunity here to improve the safety of passenger and of all road user in central london and to help the tourist economy the bill strike the right balance between the enjoyment that pedicab can offer and the protection of the public today debate prompt the question of when the government plan to bring forward their long promise transport bill which need to be wide reach and to extend beyond london and include regulation on other neglect issue such as scooter and bike for today though this legislation on pedicabs be long overdue and look forward to it progress through the house with the leave of the house have open this debate shall now bring it to close we have have short occasionally feisty and certainly interesting journey down memory lane would like to mention all those colleague who have endeavour to bring this legislation before this house and to pass it on previous occasion congratulate all colleague who have attempt to bring in this legislation through private member bills clearly we have learn an awful lot about certain individual member enjoy hear from the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse who probably have shirt obviously create in soho that say be louche in my youth the long and the short of it be that he make good and fair point genuinely believe that even though we be all economically liberal and want to see thriving bustling entrepreneurial london there have to be some degree of order and fair playing field across all form of transport there be legitimate issue to address in term of crime and the way in which this city be perceive if we do not take action it be right that on cross party basis we be take action thank all colleague for their contribution although will not go through they in detail fair point be make about noise say that have spend the good part of month of my life in st thomas hospital where experience the impact of the noise outside and have meet many representative of hotel business restaurant and theatre who be genuinely concerned at the unregulated noise be provide by some of these operator the fair point be also make that people need living breathe residential city of london and that that be simply not possible if we have unregulate noise people be literally move out because of this problem and that be not acceptable my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope rightly make legitimate and genuine point start with the fundamental principle of ask what be the end objective here that be totally legitimate thing to do and we should not in any way decry his robust attempt to get to the heart and soul of these point welcome his do so very much take on board the effort he wish to make to allay his concern prior to committee stage wish to put couple of other point on the record as my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire make clear in his brief remark tfl produce an outline in january of potential licensing framework which be in excess of page clearly it would have to be refresh because this legislation be come forward and for example noise regulation be add in the other place barely week ago we must also take into account that clause set out the requirement for guidance which be matter for the secretary of state the secretary of state give update good practice guidance for licensing authority outside london in november last year it specifically state that where there be local interest in provide pedicab service licensing authority should make adjustment to licensing requirement to accommodate such service the whole point and purpose of that be to make it easy to bring those thing in clearly clause provide capability for the secretary of state to bring in such guidance endorse the point that have be make about bike and scooter enforcement be the key issue on an ongoing basis make the final point that we will debate the bill in committee and propose to write to all member who have contribute today to set out some of those point in bit more detail genuinely commend the bill to the house question put and agree to bill accordingly read second time pedicabs london bill lords programme motion make and question

bill lords it be expedient to authorise the charging of fee under the morrissey question agree to commonwealth parliamentary association and international committee of the red cross status bill money king recommendation signify motion make and question propose that for the purpose of any act result from the commonwealth parliamentary association and international committee of the red cross status bill it be expedient to authorise the payment out of money provide by parliament of any amount refund in respect of any tax or duty in accordance with arrangement make under the huddleston rise to make few brief comment about this money resolution let begin by thank all those who work with the commonwealth parliamentary association know that be not the only member who have benefit from its expertise experience network contact and global stature which be recognise and value both here in the uk and across the commonwealth have rely on its support on many occasion have recently visit ghana and canada with the cpa and have work closely with our overseas territory crown dependency and other member of the commonwealth family it be crucial that we build those link and strengthen they at time of deep global uncertainty our ship through the commonwealth and indeed inter parliamentary relationship be crucial when it come to both cpa uk and as this money resolution apply to the cpa as whole the secretariat which be host here play critical role and pay tribute to the former member of this house our friend stephen twigg who be the secretary general also commend the work of the international committee of the red cross which obviously play critical role globally work tirelessly and meticulously to support civilian work in conflict and war zone around the world and to uphold key responsibility in relation to the law of war and humanitarian law as we know the icrc have play critical role for many decade on the substance of today money resolution the opposition fully support these move as understand it perhaps the minister will correct the money resolution do not lead to any substantial expenditure on the privilege and immunity that will be grant by the bill any expenditure will be cover in relation to the work that already go on around similar international organisation it be worth reference that the cpa have experience significant issue with concern be raise about whether it will receive these important privilege and immunity question have be raise include at recent meeting of the cpa so it be important that we get on with this as soon as possible and give it the support it need in term of change of status otherwise there could be risk for example of the cpa secretariat be move outside the uk which would be huge retrograde step it be critical that we give the icrc the specific privilege and immunity that other state grant so that its confidential and neutral important work can be carry out have hear from both the cpa and the icrc about these matter and how important this small but significant change in legislation be to they indeed have visit the icrc headquarters in geneva and listen to important development about its work in critical zone around the world as say the opposition fully support these move the money resolution be an important next step we need these change to the status and operation of these organisation bring we in line with other country and allow the organisation to do their work time be of the essence so hope that the government can move swiftly the motion be about send taxpayer money to the commonwealth parliamentary association which fully endorse and the international committee of the red cross will spend minute or two talk about the icrc because all british taxpayer be contribute the icrc play noble and important role in conflict around the world that be indisputable it would however be remiss of not to reflect on the strong criticism that it have face in recent month for its abject failure to access the hostage then more than who have be cruelly hold by hamas in unimaginable condition we should not forget that in the president of the icrc approach the german red cross to arrange for visitation with jews deport to poland and he be meet with refusal by the nazi german authority from then on in world war two the icrc opt for strategy of no long address the question of jews directly we all know the tragic consequence of that decision for which the icrc have or have retrospectively apologised and rightly so follow that apology his majesty government and other government around the world have support the international committee of the red cross with british taxpayer money and have do so for year but today family in the united kingdom and there be family in the united kingdom whose relative be be hold hostage as well as family from israel and around the world whose loved one have be miss now for almost five month understand the history of the red cross as it relate to the nazis in world war two for obvious reason and it be painful as consequence this most recent failure by the icrc will never be understand and be likely be sorry to say never to be forgive when question about that by the prime minister of israel the icrc president spoljaric egger say that apply pressure to hamas be not go to work as can be imagine that be inconceivably frustrating for israel leadership and for jewish people around the world particularly in this country israel foreign minister at the time eli cohen say that the red cross have no right to exist if it could not reach the hostage determine their condition and provide they with medical treatment and medication he add every day that pass be another failure for the red cross even more shocking be meeting with hostage family someone from the icrc go to meet hostage family and the red cross respond to plea to deliver medication to the hostage with reprimand of the hostage family tell they to think about the palestinians imagine say to recent rape victim can you think about other in the circumstance perhaps it be not surprising that report mathematical breakdown of the icrc statement on social medium show that of they solely condemn israel while only solely condemn hamas an time difference which surely point to worrying trend towards political bias in the icrc bear in mind its second world war history that be deeply sham criticism of the organisation be mount across the world as well as in israel near weekly rally have take place outside the icrc office in the united states since october to demand that the red cross meet individual in the gaza strip we be ask his majesty government for taxpayer money to go to the icrc we should take the demand about the hostage hold by hamas seriously and urgently because it be the icrc distinguish reputation that be talk about now applaud its good work in so many region around the world just want it to do good work for jewish people as well as for people around the world there be too many example of international organisation and institution and national one that do excellent work everywhere else except where jews be concerned it be for the icrc reputation that speak now where it do such excellent work internationally in other case want it to do excellent work for jewish people who be be torture with child be keep hostage this issue have lead to deep seat feeling of frustration and disappointment will conclude by say that be sure that his majesty treasury and his majesty ministers in the treasury will think carefully as they always do know that they will about spend taxpayer money thank the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty and my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis for their contribution have hear my right hon and learn friend as be sure have the icrc the purpose of the bill be to enable the government to treat the cpa and the icrc in manner comparable to that of an international organisation my right hon and learn friend make some broad comment and as say the government have hear they and be sure that the icrc have hear they thank the hon member for cardiff south and penarth for his comment particularly the way in which he too recognise and applaud the work of the commonwealth parliamentary association its purpose and role be

and international corruption cases motion make and question propose that this house do now mohindra pm this be the third debate on oligarch and lawfare that have lead in the past two year it be unfortunate that it be necessary to return once again to this matter but it be just as crucial as ever in the last three decade london have be swamp by tidal wave of money that have pour in from russia other ex soviet state china and other corrupt regime around the world cash hungry charity university and political party have gladly accept that money and have look at those deep pocket oligarch with green eyed gullibility all have show an excessive willingness to overlook the misbehaviour of the people supply the money my previous debate on this subject be in response to the bullying of former member of this place charlotte leslie by someone who have seek to take advantage of this cash for access attitude mohamed amersi over the past decade amersi have set out to purchase reputation in the british establishment seek to be know as an upright citizen and philanthropist he even have name for it access capitalism however his fame have turn to notoriety as more and more worrying information have come to light about his past he train his sight on ms leslie because of her proper exercise of due diligence in regard to he that come after he attempt to take control of the conservative middle east council which ms leslie run and then in turn seek to set up his own rival organisation amersi accuse ms leslie of libel for what she have say about he in an excessively long draw out and expensive legal case that also encompass wrongful claim of breach of datum protection rule but his campaign against she go far beyond the case itself he set out to destroy her reputation there be lie that she sexually blackmail man the collection of intimate detail about her family physical intimidation threaten letter send by notorious legal firm carter ruck to journalist and mp include myself claim that ms leslie consort with sanctioned individual and an obsessive misogynistic and ultimately defamatory hate campaign conduct on social medium by amersi himself ms leslie have at last be vindicate in court with mr justice nicklin note amersi exorbitant approach to the litigation and the fact that subject person to successive civil claim can be hallmark of abusive conduct amersi clearly hop that he could break ms leslie resolve and force she to concede through bullying intimidation and the threat of financial ruin he fail he also seek to intimidate current member of this place the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge who have likewise try to shed light on his dealing thank to those two people and the relentless work of journalist such as tom burgis upon whose new book cuckooland will draw today we know that amersi be deeply immerse in twilight world of backroom bribe creative accountancy and whole lot of smoke and mirror that be why he be so desperate to suppress ms leslie claim he do not want to be expose and have his carefully craft public image that of savvy entrepreneur and generous philanthropist shred with that in mind close look at his past be warrant the name of the regime that amersi have aid abet and enriched make for shopping list of dictatorship and autocracy first let we look at russia as with so many tale of corruption and kleptocracy the story start in russia in amersi be an adviser in deal with the danish lawyer and businessman jeffrey galmond galmond claim to own large swathe of the russian telecom market in reality though he be say to be frontman for the russian telecom minister and putin ally leonid reiman who use galmond to exercise his control over the sector that be confirm by swiss arbitration tribunal in which note that reiman arrange deal to misappropriate russian state asset for his personal enrichment it seem likely that amersi payment for the million come from the proceed of crime against the russian people funnel via galmond in an affidavit issue by galmond the year before the deal amersi advise on galmond acknowledge the existence of allegation about his relationship with reiman we know that amersi would have have copy of that affidavit which surely should have raise some question in his mind yet the deal go ahead and amersi get his million it be straightforward case of fixer be reward for facilitate deal of course amersi deny know the truth about galmond but we have to ask ourselves how ignorant someone work on such deal could really have be it have be clear for year that the post soviet regime in russia be kleptocracy indeed alexander litvinenko be murder in because he have be investigate post soviet corruption however russia be not the only place of interest also want to focus on few place where amersi have be active uzbekistan nepal and kazakhstan in those place amersi work as representative of teliasonera large swedish telecom firm his pay be an astonishing day that give we an idea of what teliasonera think he bring to the company but the question have to be ask what on earth could amersi possibly bring to the table to justify salary of nearly million year in uzbekistan the deal amersi be involve in lead to finding of criminal activity in essence teliasonera the company amersi work for agree to buy company control by the president of uzbekistan daughter for hugely inflate price in order to gain access to the uzbek market that company and its uzbek subsidiary later admit that it have pay more than million in bribe to an uzbek official that be corruption pay bribe by vastly overpay in business deal that ultimately profit member of corrupt regime the american department of justice confirm that teliasonera corruptly build lucrative telecommunications business in uzbekistan use bribe payment wire around the world through account here in new york city as result of all this various judicial authority end up impose fine of nearly billion on teliasonera in amersi plead ignorance if we believe his version of event he have no idea that teliasonera be craft massive bung for corrupt post soviet regime however amersi know that the uzbek businessman with whom teliasonera be deal run telecom company that accord to memo that amersi have see be control by affiliate of the uzbek president daughter that will be something of theme in these case amersi say that he could not possibly have know but then be expose by the documentary evidence the pattern be that of specialist in shady dealing and it be for that specialism that teliasonera be pay he nearly million year amersi work for teliasonera extend to nepal where he help that company gain access to the telecom market at the time nepal be control by corrupt maoist regime in this sphere amersi facilitate deal with nepalese business tycoon ajeya raj sumargi which involve many million of dollar find its way to sumargi however it be not really sumargi whose friendship teliasonera seek it be that of the corrupt maoist government that much be clear from report commission by teliasonera and carry out by private intelligence specialist control risks which note that its source believe sumargi handle and invest unaccounte money for various maoist leader control risks far report that sumargi relationship with lead nepalese politician and now prime minister prachanda extend beyond the realm of business it appear sumargi even buy prachanda house in his sister in law name the report also note exist allegation of bribery and corruption against sumargi and claim of unethical or illegal business practice even after this report amersi urge teliasonera to maintain its relationship with sumargi which it do to the tune of million of dollar yet another example of this pattern be find in kazakhstan where amersi facilitate large questionable business deal to the benefit of banker accuse of be front for the corrupt kazakh regime both teliasonera and amersi be handsomely reward for this once again amersi will claim he could not possibly have know of this corruption but this be clear pattern of behaviour this be man who know exactly what he be do as have say in all these case amersi maintain his innocence in fact he tell mr burgis that he would only deem potential business partner to be corrupt if there be proof high bar of course than that of criminal court and bar rarely reach but never reach if you always look the other way report by the highly respected legal firm norton rose fulbright commission by teliasonera in the wake of its corruption scandal note that the nature of the service and the relationship provide by amersi be not transparent it appear often deliberately so it state that in his dealing with teliasonera amersi be take no obvious risk and do not have the kind of overhead associate with an investment bank yet be be pay like one throughout the report amersi be refer to as mr xy if member care to read it the report note that in some case he be apparently pay twice for provide the same service at one point receive fee of million it also highlight back to back payment arrangement classic laundering exercise whereby teliasonera would pay his company and his company would then pay the third party in question the same amount would like to turn to amersi relationship with the british legal system which be the core of this much have be say about this in the past and do not want to repeat what and other have say in this house but there be one aspect we must focus on and it relate to amersi legal case against charlotte leslie that be one of the key strategic lawsuit against public participation that we talk about when we raise the slapp campaign back in january in hearing in this case in june last year the preside judge mr justice nicklin ask both side to state what cost they have incur in fight the case to that point ms leslie team provide the information but mr amersi lawyer fail or refuse to do so this be rather odd as justice nicklin point out amersi lawyer be decline to provide information that be already in the public domain as he put it would you help with how you can maintain claim of confidentiality when you have give an interview to newspaper in which you have tell the newspaper how much your cost be that interview from june be with tom burgis and publish in the financial times the lawyer response in court be to say that burgis reporting be inaccurate and misrepresent the truth the figure quote by be wrong and amersi have never say it in fact however the transcript of the interview show exactly what he say worth of cost right nearly now after the dpa data protection act filing against ms leslie amersi go on to confirm the figure in an email to the private eye journalist richard brooks in and his lawyer from the notorious firm carter ruck do the same in threatening letter they send to the financial times in yet in court amersi lawyer tell mr justice nicklin that the cost have not be reveal to mr burgis which be lie amersi claim in swear witness statement that he do not say that my legal cost be approach which be also lie in short burgis reporting be correct and amersi and his lawyer know that when they tell the court it be not be not lawyer but that would appear to to be perjury picture emerge of an attempt to avoid justice by obscure the truth indeed it be not only the court system that mr amersi have seek to bend his will he have attempt to buy his way into the british establishment and worryingly he have have some success amersi have manage to recast himself as philanthropist and benefactor rather than the shady political fixer for corrupt politician that he really be he have donate to charity academic institution and the conservative party and apparently he now intend to donate to labour clearly he will do whatever he can to get influence the british establishment be clearly vulnerable there be green eyed gullibility at the top of our society with institution happy to hoover up cash without ask question be afraid that the origin of that vulnerability date back to the blair year when tendency to overlook inconvenient truth about wealthy donor become embed but it have to be say that it do not improve with subsequent government either indeed the sad truth be that amersi be just one of many people who take advantage of our freedom to enrich themselves and to dodge accountability welcome that the action the government have take to make it hard for oligarch and their enabler to bend our justice system to their will but there be much more work to be do to ensure that british justice be the enemy of these corrupt individual and not tool for achieve their wicked end the government be properly start to change the law on slapp but to deal with current misbehaviour we need to enforce the law that already exist to protect ordinary british citizen there must also be more scrutiny of such people attempt to buy their way to good reputation although have set out to detail an accurate account of amersi behaviour base on extensive documentation it be for the appropriate legal body to come to decision on his innocence or guilt however we know that amersi facilitate corrupt deal the repeat nature of the murky practice involve be strike and he put charlotte leslie through year of persecution and torture for her due diligence in what may have amount in my view it do to criminal harassment the bribery act be clear that it be an offence for british citizen to bribe foreign public official no matter where in the world that action take place mr amersi be british citizen and he must obey british law his dealing in the former soviet union and nepal be therefore surely matter for the national crime agency to consider furthermore the metropolitan police must now consider whether the action against charlotte leslie constitute criminal harassment and the judiciary should consider the question of perjury that outline moment or two ago will send copy of the hansard for today debate to all those agency know that the solicitors regulation authority be already review complaint about the conduct of carter ruck in these matter the very due diligence that ms leslie have be attack for be exactly what we need when it come to people like amersi we must ensure that it happen and that it be not prevent by the kind of bullying deploy by mr amersi all this be test case for how we handle corruption and cronyism in our country it be imperative we meet that test if london be not to become global capital for sleaze be grateful for the opportunity to take part in this debate and thank my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for have secure it he have be an exemplary advocate on the challenge that corruption pose to the rule of law and freedom of speech my right hon friend have raise some serious issue as he will know investigation be conduct independently of his majesty government and we be unable to speculate or comment specifically on any individual allegation this debate engage issue of fundamental importance to our democracy and value we must confront the reality that while our justice system stand as beacon of fairness and equality for many the corrosive effect of corruption can undermine justice here and around the world in acknowledge that challenge we affirm our commitment to uphold the principle of justice and to ensure that the rule of law remain steadfast corruption can threaten our national security and prosperity through slow erosion of trust in institution at home and overseas development be slow when poor nation have their resource drain away which hamper their ability to mobilise revenue and facilitate growth and investment while undermine wide effort to reduce poverty at its most extreme corruption can fuel state capture where private interest trump the public interest as corrupt actor take over the state institution and decision make process to serve their own agenda while instance of corruption may be isolate their impact reverberate far beyond the confine of individual case undermine public trust and confidence in the legal system as whole the british justice system have in recent year see the rise of strategic litigation against public participation which have chilling effect on freedom of expression and civic engagement deter individual and organisation from exercise their right to free speech for fear of legal reprisal we know that free speech be critical in the fight against corruption for it enable truth tell where corrupt actor rely on precisely the opposite the climate of fear and self censorship that slapp create lead to stifle public debate undermine the robust exchange that we hold as essential fortunately we can point to progress in counter slapp in this jurisdiction we be the first jurisdiction to legislate at the national level to combat slapp relate to economic crime in last year economic crime and corporate transparency act work be also under way to ensure that new procedural rule be design to give the legislation effect such that slapp defendant have fair fight when confront with abusive threat or proceeding just last week the government be proud to announce their support for private member bill on slapp introduce by the hon member for caerphilly wayne david whom congratulate on his commitment to challenge abusive litigation that undermine british justice the bill follow the approach set out in the economic crime and corporate transparency act which as hon member know introduce new define characteristic in statute to empower judge task with identify these case an early dismissal mechanism that cut short case with improper purpose at their heart and cost protection regime that will provide defendant with clarity around the cost risk they be expose to when respond to slapp threat the bill pass its second reading which be an essential step in legislate comprehensively against slapp no matter their subject matter or the cause of action in question be pleased to note the support that we have receive from stakeholder across medium law civil society and both houses of parliament it be credit to our country that so many be prepared to come together to tackle this issue across the political spectrum however combat corruption and preserve access to justice require more than just legislative solution it demand cultural shift that place ethic and integrity at the forefront of our justice system we be fortunate in this country to have independent regulator that uphold the high professional standard the solicitors regulation authority take swift action by launch thematic review of slapp activity and publish warning notice early on when the issue come to light that encourage renew engagement with guidance on aggressive correspondence and the notorious letter often issue at the start of slapp claim those marked confidential or without prejudice such label be design to intimidate people who may not have immediate access to legal advice such that they withdraw from intended publication we be work together across government to champion co ordinate approach to slapp the department for culture media and sport lead the slapps taskforce which bring together actor in the medium freedom space to propose non legislative measure to stamp out slapp the taskforce be make progress across workstream that seek to raise awareness and develop regulatory response on the issue benefit from the depth of expertise among the medium and law professional take part aside from abusive lawsuit let address the government effort to combat corruption in the broad sense it be an undoubted benefit that the uk be an open economy with one of the world major financial centre in the city of london that mean that we need strong defence to prevent bribery and corruption here and abroad the government take decisive action on bribery by modernise uk criminal law through the bribery act reform in that legislation set the international gold standard for anti bribery and corruption law and be find to be an exemplary piece of legislation by the other place follow post legislative scrutiny in the past fortnight the serious fraud office have bring charge against two individual for allege bribery in the oil and gas sector in the middle east the charge build on number of critical enforcement milestone that have be meet in recent year include our large ever financial penalty for bribery follow the conviction of glencore which be order to pay million in be proud of all that be be do to keep corruption at bay whether through action against illicit finance or legislation that protect public participation in the public interest we must continue this work together to ensure that corruption find no home in our jurisdiction question put and agree to house adjourn
