get the department for transport here to engage as well as the scottish government echo the hon gentleman point have drive along the road myself my note helpfully say that average speed on the and be low than on several other scottish trunk road you can say that again think that the secretary of state for scotland have write to he and offer meeting to discuss the issue we all want to see the road improve to the and the add the which be the link from the highlands to scotland for year we have be wait for it to be dualle the snp have fail to do that the scottish government can not make the ferry work and they can not make the road work can the secretary of state push they into action have many and varied responsibility but be not aware that the be one of they hope that the scottish government will have hear my hon friend strong plea eu trade agreement economic impact what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the uk eu trade agreement announce on may on the economy in northern ireland what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the uk eu trade agreement announce on may on the economy in northern ireland what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the uk eu trade agreement announce on may on the economy in northern ireland the government new strategic partnership with the eu will deliver broad range of economic benefit for northern ireland in particular new agreement on agrifood and plant will far smooth trade flow across the irish sea protect the uk internal market reduce cost for business and improve consumer choice in northern ireland be pleased that the agreement secure with our large trading partner the european union will make it easy for food and drink to be import and export will the secretary of state assure and my constituent that all future conversation with trading partner will continue to prioritise high welfare standard and food standard on both side of the irish sea can happily give my hon friend that assurance he will have notice how in another context the trade agreement reach with the united states of america we say that we would uphold our food standard in that agreement and that be exactly what we have do which of the sanitary and phytosanitary and agrifood requirement do the secretary of state expect to be remove on good move from great britain to northern ireland as result of the sps agreement with the eu once we have negotiate the legal text and put our rulebook in line with current european arrangement there will be no need for sps paperwork no mandatory identity check or physical check on good move no need for northern ireland plant health label an end to the ban on chill frozen meat move an end to the ban on movement of product of animal origin import to gb and then move to northern ireland and no onward paperwork or check on agrifood move for onward processing that be why the sps agreement in outline have be so widely welcome in northern ireland be pleased to say that the propose sps agreement have be welcome by the welsh farming community include those in my constituency of clwyd east that be alongside the ulster farmers union the federation of small businesses the cbi the horticultural trades association supermarket include asda and iceland and many other do the secretary of state agree with and with they that an sps agreement would bring huge benefit for wales northern ireland and the rest of the uk it certainly would it be rare agreement that invite so much praise certainly across the range of opinion in northern ireland we all want to see it progress as quickly as possible so we have get to turn it into legal text and sort out our own legal rulebook the benefit will then flow for business right across the united kingdom the windsor framework be cause untold damage to business in northern ireland it cost one of my local business to bring box of simple tie from gb to northern ireland because of the parcel border and use farm machinery be now subject to eu import procedure with some have be turn back from the port to scotland in recent day the late fsb report confirm that small business be be hard hit with red tape cost and uncertainty will the secretary of state accept that the reset be not help the here and now will he commit to meet these industry and help to sort out practical solution on the agricultural machinery point that the hon member raise if the machinery be come into and stay in northern ireland it can be bring in subject to cleaning with plant health label that be relatively straightforward only if it might move into ireland would it need to go through the red lane will make this general point in northern ireland purchase of good from the rest of the united kingdom rise by and northern ireland be the fast grow region in the uk with regard to agricultural machinery be sure that the secretary of state be aware of northern ireland farmer who take agricultural machinery from northern ireland to participate in scottish agricultural show on bring it back it be reject in northern ireland and send back to scotland because there may have be soil on the underside of piece of agricultural equipment do the secretary of state really think that that make common sense it be the requirement of the windsor framework which the last government negotiate to address the basic problem of have two different system and an open border everybody know that agricultural machinery need to be properly clean if that be the case and the appropriate label which be straightforward be apply there be nothing to stop the machinery move back to northern ireland if the reset deal be suppose to bring an end to the sps check when will the custom post which be there for the purpose of carry out those check be demolish instead the secretary of state willingly preside over the ever tighten eu noose on our economy with agricultural machinery be the late that have to kowtow to eu diktat meanwhile trade diversion be rampant and the secretary of state look the other way when will he stop act as the secretary of state for the eu and start act as the secretary of state for northern ireland do not accept the hon gentleman characterisation at some point he have to acknowledge that follow our departure from the european union this be the issue that the previous government have to address the united kingdom have one set of rule the eu have another and there be an open border how do we deal with that be afraid that on mutual enforcement the only idea have ever hear he put forward be not practical proposition he need to take some responsibility for the consequence of his own argument the eu uk deal be warmly and broadly welcome across northern ireland to begin to unpick and undo some of the damage and friction create by brexit which be champion by some of those on the opposition benches however an fsb report out this week highlight continue problem particularly for small business will the secretary of state reassure business that there will be co design and full consultation as the text and the outworking of that very positive deal be bring through we will continue to consult as widely as possible in take forward the agreement that have be reach and outline with the european union there be help available for small business it be important that it be as effective and easy to understand for those who seek to trade will look carefully at the report that the fsb have produce regard the eu trade agreement what barrier be the secretary of state aware of that currently hinder free and unfettered trade from northern ireland within the uk what be the timescale for their removal good flow freely from northern ireland to the rest of the united kingdom far one of the great advantage of the trade agreement that have be negotiate with india the united states of america and the european union be in the case of india significant reduction of tariff on whisky which will benefit producer in northern ireland and be able to sell lamb into india the deal with the united states of america will allow northern ireland farmer to sell their beef call the shadow minister contrary to what the secretary of state have just tell the house two week ago the federation of small businesses in northern ireland publish report suggest that third of small business that move good between great britain and northern ireland have cease supply customer or partner either in great britain or in northern ireland under the northern ireland protocol if the uk experience diversion of trade we be entitle to take unilateral action to safeguard our internal market will the secretary of state tell the house whether he think that third of small business cease trade in that way amount to diversion of trade if not perhaps he could tell we what would there be other small business that be able to trade the point that the hon gentleman need to recognise be that if some small business manage to move their good from gb to northern ireland other can do so in the end it be decision for an individual business where it choose to sell its good it be the windsor framework that apply now not the northern ireland protocol and think he will accept that the windsor framework represent significant improvement on what be there before call the liberal democrat spokesperson the federation of small businesses have warn that small and medium sized enterprise in northern ireland continue to face disruption under the windsor framework and more importantly and sadly that the government have fail to effectively communicate the suppose benefit of dual market access so far if dual market access be indeed competitive advantage as so many people across this house think it can and should be can the secretary of state specifically identify what concrete benefit it be provide to northern ireland business right now how do he respond to the grow criticism from firm across the uk who be burden with red tape and the fog of uncertainty be interested by that observation in the fsb report because as the house will testify spend lot of my time extoll the virtue of the dual market access that northern ireland have as result of the windsor framework meet company as travel around northern ireland who tell about the benefit of it that they be feel think we all have responsibility to extol the virtue of dual market access because in my experience if business can see an opportunity that allow they to sell more product they will seize it with both hand investment technology business what recent discussion he have have with technology business on invest in northern ireland what recent discussion he have have with technology business on invest in northern ireland what recent discussion he have have with technology business on invest in northern ireland take every opportunity to promote investment into northern ireland and our tech

dual market access the unique concentration of tech company the academic support from ulster university and queen university and above all the people northern ireland have workforce with industry ready skill and innovation in their dna do the minister agree that the strength of northern ireland tech sector mean that it can play huge part in become an ai superpower support by this government however as we have hear in the northern ireland committee chair by my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi there be huge link between online safety and the rate of domestic abuse that we be see in northern ireland can the minister comment on how we can support and develop the sector while keep woman and girl safe we know that violence against woman and girl be an epidemic and online safety be an important part of that couple with northern ireland be an ai superpower as my hon friend rightly say there be opportunity for ai company many of which have meet to work on the tech to ensure that perpetrator be catch that justice be do and that we ensure that online safety be take extremely seriously the work that will be do in the industrial strategy to promote ai work with the new ai growth zone for example can ensure that we lock that in tech business be huge in my central london constituency and recognise that for the uk to do well we need london to continue thrive and for northern ireland and the rest of the country to succeed too can the minister assure that the full benefit of the new industrial strategy will support company in northern ireland and that this government be generate business opportunity in every corner of the united kingdom the industrial strategy be good news for northern ireland it be bold long term plan to give business and investor the certainty they need to thrive the eight sector of the strategy map well with northern ireland world class strength include advanced manufacturing cyber defence the creative industry life science and

belfast economic corridor which include my constituency of lagan valley will play key part and that it be huge opportunity for investment belfast be already at the heart of the uk industrial strategy

deal which be at the heart of that be an important part have meet business across belfast and northern ireland that be lead on this and it be exciting to see do the minister accept though that poor road access from the north of the united kingdom be one impediment to investment in northern ireland and therefore another reason why we should see the upgrading the secretary of state have already answer the question on the road it be important that we look at and address all part of the infrastructure that be hold northern ireland back in any way tech business in northern ireland could take advantage of heathrow logistic hub ballykelly in my constituency have large available land base seaport close by an airport next door to it and railway line that run through it do the minister think that be an excellent location for such hub and tech business the hon member be an excellent representative for his constituency and the opportunity there be sure his plea and bid have be hear call the chair of the select committee as chair of the select committee and the itv all party parliamentary group last night we host an event in parliament with itv and utv there what conversation be the minister have with public sector broadcaster like itv about future investment in northern ireland many different type of business not only public sector broadcaster but tech company fintech cyber security and advanced manufacturing such as catagen which meet last week be all part of the strong ecosystem in northern ireland the fact that broadcaster can talk to advanced manufacturer which can talk to other make northern ireland such fantastic place to invest in and be glad that that be be highlight in the house of commons today britain lead the world in the gene editing of crop this technology enable our farmer to produce disease and drought resistant crop reduce cost and increase food production the uk eu trade agreement mean britain have to follow eu rule on sanitary and phytosanitary law will the minister give the house an assurance that the agreement will not slow that technology in britain that be why the secretary of state have be extoll and make clear how important the sps agreement be we be not take our foot off the pedal in any way towards that it be not only agri science but life science that be lead the way for northern ireland and the uk and across the world we want to ensure that we continue to support they in every way we can spending review northern ireland executive what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on

spending review reflect this government broad commitment to fair funding across the uk include in area like cornwall where rurality seasonal pressure and historical underfunding be finally be recognise and that many in cornwall would welcome the opportunity to far shape our own future through level of devolution close to that enjoy in northern ireland the spending review settlement do indeed reflect the government commitment to provide resource right across the united kingdom year ago people be say there be go to be fiscal cliff edge but the money be make available for northern ireland mean that no one be say that now thank you for call mr order there be no need to run through the chamber mr morgan that be in very bad taste apologise mr speaker local growth funding have

money between all the need in northern ireland include health where of course there be significant pressure the public service transformation fund that the last government make available be now begin to be use to reform some of the way in which the health service work call the shadow secretary of state the spending review settlement for the northern ireland office explicitly cover the finucane inquiry but so far the government have refuse to say how much money have be set aside for that inquiry will the secretary of state please tell the house how much do the government expect the inquiry to cost the finucane inquiry be begin its work it will publish as be normal statement of the expenditure that it engage in it depend how long the inquiry last and how much evidence be take but the hon gentleman can rest assure that he will receive an answer in due course as that process unfold the government have just have spending review so they must know how much they intend to spend there will be line in the treasury account set aside for the finucane inquiry do not understand why the secretary of state find it so hard to tell the house how much we expect to spend similarly the government must know how much compensation they expect to pay gerry adams follow their inexplicable decision to drop the appeal that we lodge in that case we have repeatedly press the government to legislate to prevent that compensation from be pay and the government have drag their heel this morning policy exchange have publish an excellent new report legislate about gerry adams and carltona which set out clear legal solution the government have nowhere far to hide so will they finally do the right thing the hon gentleman need to keep up answer parliamentary question yesterday in which make it clear

prepared to take money out of the pocket of the most vulnerable they at least have the courage to stand forward and say that gerry adams would get none so thank the secretary of state for that also

concern when we be talk of the spending review two week ago he be ask whether the financial transaction capital be make available to casement park be additional he know that the blue book have flat

hon lady know that no prime minister or chancellor ever stand at the dispatch box and write future budgets that be not what the conservatives do and it be not what we be do and she know it she talk

tackle knife crime in croydon where youth violence have cast devastating shadow across our community our local police be run surrender scheme this month to take those dangerous weapon off our street will the prime minister join in commend the tireless work of croydon police officer and will he outline what his government be do to ensure that the met police have the resource they need both to protect neighbourhood policing and to deal with the unique challenge they face my hon friend be right to speak of the importance of ban these despicable weapon know how much she care about this issue the ban on zombie knife and machete come into effect last year and the ban on ninja sword will come into effect this august the crime and policing bill will increase penalty for illegal sale and will give the police new power to seize knife what do the conservatives do when we put that bill before the house to take those measure they vote against it knife crime soar on their watch and they have clearly learn absolutely nothing call the leader of the liberal democrats yesterday the government be ask the house to vote for law that would mean that someone with condition such as parkinson or multiple sclerosis would qualify for personal independence payment today but someone diagnose with the same condition with the very same symptom in few month time would not we all know that the cost of welfare need to come down but that be not fair way to do it until he lose control yesterday the prime minister be argue for that approach have he change his mind on this or not the stephen timms review very important review will look into this issue but what we do do last night be end mandatory reassessment for those with severe disability think that the right hon gentleman and his party care about thing like that it be the right thing to do and they vote against it we have rebalance universal credit which be long overdue think he believe that but what do he do last night he vote against it we set out pathway to reform personal independence payment which be something he argue for every week and what do he do when he have the chance he vote against it the house and labour back benchers will note that the prime minister do not answer my question moreover if he look at our proposal for welfare reform to cut down the bill he would not be in the mess that he be in move on from hillsborough to grenfell from primodos to horizon and from the contaminated blood scandal to nuclear test veteran the bereaved and survivor of some of our country most appalling scandal have come together to call for legal duty of candour and for the secondary duty need to make it practical and effective for investigation and inquiry they be now frightened that the government be water down these proposal to such an extent that they would be toothless after month of delay can the prime minister reassure campaigner that his hillsborough law will include real legal duty of candour as he promise yes it will as the right hon gentleman may know have know some of the hillsborough family for many year meet they over decade ago and know exactly what they have be through various other group have suffer similar injustice with similar follow up which be an additional injustice on top of the original injustice that be why we will bring forward hillsborough law it be commitment have make have be talk to the family myself in recent week to make sure that we get this right it be important that we get it right but it will have legal duty of candour have follow on question the prime minister visit my constituency in and tell family that one of my first act will be to put the hillsborough law on the statute book he repeat the same promise at conference last year say that the bill would be publish on the anniversary in april that do not happen however the government be now plan to table water down version that do not deserve to be name hillsborough law after pmq my hon friend the member for liverpool west derby ian byrne will seek to introduce the real hillsborough law can the prime minister finally honour his promise and back the law in full if not why not be grateful to my hon friend for raise this and remember well the visit we have this be really serious issue and it be important that we get it right be fully committed to introduce hillsborough law include legal duty of candour for public servant and criminal sanction for those who refuse to comply it be important that we get it right have be personally engage with some of the family on this because as say

about to conclude it be disgrace that labour have breach the parliamentary convention and deny the house meaningful debate and vote on ratification the minister say that we will get vote on the bill but have vote on the bill be not the same as vote on treaty under crag early this week the house of lords have debate and vote where the lib dems side with labour in back this billion surrender treaty which be subsidise tax cut in mauritius why can not we have debate and vote in this house what be ministers afraid of be they afraid that their back benchers now worried about benefit cut and the impact of unpopular tax rise will question why so much money be be hand over for territory that we own and will force they into another embarrassing turn be they afraid that mps across the house will do the math even and see that the actual amount of money go to mauritius will be at least billion and not the billion accountancy valuation claim that minister talk about be they afraid that labour bareface hypocrisy and appal treatment of the chagossian community will be expose the minister once say the people of chagos must be at the heart of decision about their future official report october vol but this surrender treaty betray they he have betray they leave any decision on resettlement and support through the trust fund in the hand of mauritius with legal case ongoing will the minister extend the crag process until all legal challenge have conclude will the minister finally admit that labour make october bad deal even weak by give up the unilateral right to extend the lease on the base and ditch the clause authorise the uk to exercise sovereign right the prime minister of mauritius have say that it have do that so will the minister finally admit it will the minister confirm that there be no guarantee that the current level of marine protection will continue there be too much ambiguity we have not have clarity there be no guarantee on security or on safeguarding unanswered question about notification requirement around the base and no guarantee that mauritius will not pursue further lawfare to stop operation at the base if it think they contravene international law include try to block nuclear weapon as the pelindaba treaty now apply to the chagos island the minister should scrap this treaty or at least have the courage to bring it here for proper debate full scrutiny and finally vote in this house genuinely have to say as somebody who have respect for and like the right hon lady that be disappoint by the tone of those remark do not know who write this stuff do not know whether it be just performative politic or rhetoric do know what should point out that have receive and answer over write parliamentary question from the right hon lady have answer over question in total on the deal and the process we have have no few than six urgent question in this house we have have two statement from the government from the foreign secretary and the defence secretary personally brief the right hon lady and answer many of her question in my office just couple of week ago in good faith and in detail have be subject quite rightly to robust scrutiny on these issue not only by the foreign affairs committee but by the international relations and defence committee and the international agreements committee in the other house in great detail do not know whether the right hon lady and her team be simply not read the transcript or the answer to the question but have repeatedly answer they she might not like the answer mr speaker but have answer these question have set out the position on cost have set out the position on the security arrangement have set out the position on the veto that we have the fact be that this deal secure this base and it secure our national security and that of our ally it be absolutely right that it have have proper scrutiny and there will be vote because there will be vote on the legislation that we will put before the house in due course on recent visit to washington with the foreign affairs committee be strike by the support express by the us government for the deal to secure the long term future of the military base on diego garcia alongside the us our five eyes ally support the deal nato support the deal and india support the deal do the minister agree that the opposition would do well to listen to our close neighbour and ally instead of try to play party politic with our national security my hon friend be absolutely right national security be the top priority of this government and work with our crucial ally include the united states be key to that he be absolutely right to point out the support that be gain for this deal through full and detailed inter agency process in the united states at the high level of the administration as well as the support from our five eyes partner and from india the fact be that this deal secure the base and secure our capability and it would not have be sign off if it do not do that call the liberal democrat spokesperson the shambolic process of secure this deal have leave many question for the house but the glare omission at the heart of that negotiation have be the failure by successive government to properly consult the chagossian people for much of their history chagossians have be deny consultation on who govern they and their right to self determination we liberal democrats now fear that in handing over the sovereignty of the island to mauritius without properly reflect the interest of chagossians the government be only reinforce that legacy the right hon member for witham priti patel criticise the action of liberal democrat peer in the other place yet only the liberal democrats champion the right of the chagossian people and secure commitment from the government to make statement to both houses on their approach before ratification in the light of those shortcoming it be wrong that the government have not bring the treaty to this house for scrutiny will the minister reverse that decision today and give parliamentarian the opportunity to assess and vote on the final deal genuinely thank the hon gentleman for the generally constructive way in which he and his colleague have approach the process he be absolutely right to speak about the chagossians indeed as have point out many time the chagossians interest in this matter have be at the heart of our discussion we have the trust fund we have the agreement to start visit again of course mauritius will be able to restart programme of resettlement he have hear the remark make by my noble friend in the other place in response to the question that his honourable colleague raise we have be very clear about what we will do in that regard and hold to that here today have to challenge the suggestion that the treaty have not receive scrutiny it be receive scrutiny right now it have be receive scrutiny in the foreign affairs committee it have receive scrutiny in the other place and it have receive scrutiny through parliamentary question it be receive scrutiny and it be absolutely right that it do the minister have just set out the scrutiny that this matter have receive in various place but be really take by the number of question that he say he have receive from the shadow foreign secretary on this subject can he tell how many question he have receive on other matter of global importance my hon friend ask an important question since the treaty be lay have have write question from the right hon lady in comparison have have four on gibraltar two on ukraine and one on poland he be right that this matter have receive scrutiny be not be funny but it be amazing that the minister have those figure to hand the hon gentleman for whom have huge amount of respect keep say that the government have no choice but to do this deal do not believe that to be true my successor lord cameron do not believe that to be true either which be why neither he nor sign off an agreement will the minister please explain to the house in detail why he believe that he have no choice include what body at what time and with what jurisdiction in the interest of time refer the right hon member to the detailed evidence that give in the house of lords on this matter the other day include on the legal circumstance he know the risk to the operation of the base in the medium and short term and he recognise the risk of bind legal judgment which we believe to be inevitable his government know that which be why they start the process he may not have be able to conclude the deal accept that speaker but the previous government go through round of negotiation because they recognise the importance of do this deal they know that secure the facility be crucial to our national security we put our national security and secure this base first and that have meet with the approval of the united states and other five eyes ally have to admit that be rather confused because be sure that the shadow foreign secretary be in the cabinet when the decision be make to start these negotiation too often we focus on the military aspect of this deal but can the minister confirm that it will also end dangerous irregular migration route into the uk my hon friend be absolutely right this government take early action even before the conclusion of the deal to ensure that that route be close down by the memorandum of understanding that we reach with st helena for which again thank st helena again speaker be rightly scrutinise by this house on that my hon friend be absolutely right on that point and that be why we have do this deal can the minister tell the house why he think china support this deal have be very clear on this the united states our five eyes partner and india support this deal mauritius be one of the few country not to join the belt and road initiative it be very clear that the deal be in the interest of our security and that of our ally otherwise the united states would not have agree to it in the first place clearly language such as surrender be inflammatory and inappropriate conservative members of this house wax lyrical and make song and dance about national security will my hon friend remind they that on their watch our armed force be hollow out with the army reach its small size since the napoleonic war and spending never once reach be it not true that labour be the party of strong defence and strong national security my hon friend be right whether it be in the ambitious agenda for national security and defence set out in the strategic defence review in the unity and leadership we show at the nato summit last week or in secure our crucial national security basis include diego garcia this government be lead from the front when it come to national security quite frankly the conservative party be show some brass neck after hollow out our armed force leave this deal undo and so many other thing simply do not understand it speaker simply ask the minister the same question that ask when he first come to the house on this matter in relation to the cost consequence of this deal he know that the lion share of the interest lie with the military base on diego garcia therefore what contribution be the united states make to the very significant cost of compensate the mauritian people the united states make significant and crucial contribution to the operation from diego garcia they be of quantum much great than the cost that we will pay in relation to the base under this deal the benefit to the united kingdom the united states and our ally be priceless and this government will not scrimp on our national security the cost of this deal be equivalent to quarter of of our defence budget and that be in the context of government who have make the high sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war when the minister speak to our international friend and ally what be their message about the work that we be do to restore confidence in national security and our reputation on the global stage and what message should the opposition take from those conversation repeatedly hear strong vote of confidence in our investment in national security and defence whether it be from our european partner or from the united states one just have to look at our leadership at the nato summit and our ongoing support for ukraine which we agree on across the house my hon friend ask about the value and the cost have set out the cost on number of occasion but as he say it be just fraction of of our annual defence budget it would pay to run the nhs for just five hour it also compare favourably with other ally for example france pay approximately million year for its base in djibouti diego garcia be time large and the capability be priceless the minister rightly say that the base on diego garcia be vital for our national security and we all agree on that the key issue be what notification have to be give to the mauritius government for the base to be use for operational purpose my hon friend the minister of state for the armed forces have reply to multiple question on this topic as have indeed answer these question in the due scrutiny that receive the other day we do not have to provide notification in advance the treaty refer to expeditiously inform after the event and that be absolutely the normal course of business be clear that the operation and the operational autonomy of this base be secure under this deal it be amazing that we be to give up an important security base without it be necessary to do so that we be to pay billion to government that will allow they to make tax cut while we impose tax burden on our own country and that the minister stand here today at the dispatch box and say that he do not have time to explain why it be necessary to do so surely the way to ensure that we have proper scrutiny of this deal be to have proper debate or be he afraid that his own back benchers once they hear the real story will find it as difficult to walk through the lobby for it as they do for the welfare reform bill yesterday have respect for the right hon gentleman but totally reject his assertion there be full support for this deal and indeed full support for it from our ally in the united states and the five eyes partner on the point about allege tax cut at no point in his budget speech do prime minister ramgoolam say that he be plan to fund income tax reform with the money from this deal that be very very clear indeed the rationale for this deal which have explain multiple time to the house be that our national security be at risk and the operation of that base could not function as they once do that be why the opposition start the negotiation and why we have conclude they after yesterday complete chaos my constituent be brace themselves for big tax increase in the autumn how do the minister think they feel when they see the mauritian government crowing about virtually abolish income tax in mauritius thank to the largesse that he be about to pour on they be genuinely surprised by the comment of the right hon gentleman as former defence minister and someone who have serve he will know the importance of this base and the need to secure it and he will know the risk to our operation that be inherent under the previous government that be why his government start this process and why we have conclude it it be also why our cost under the deal be broadly comparable with what france pay for its base in djibouti even though our base time large and have immeasurably more capability as he well know in the minister response he quote the answer from the defence secretary to my question say that he have no choice but the reason for do this deal be the worry about be take to court so the government do have choice and that be what my constituent and opposition members be so upset about the government could have fight in the court and appeal the decision yet they have choose not to and they will not explain why will the minister set out what the need be for immediacy and why he and his government will not go to the court for the tribunal he be so worried about to have that fight if the case be shut down opposition members would understand and if it be find that we have legal responsibility to pay we would do so but we do not and we have not have our day in court as country that be the travesty of the deal have to correct the hon member as we have have day in court on this issue that be one of the there be the non bind judgment in the international court of justice he also forget to mention the international tribunal for the law of the sea the vote in the united nations and all the other legal process the fact be it be our view indeed it be the view of the previous government that legally bind judgment would inevitably follow leave such key national security asset in that way be not responsible no the responsible thing to do be to secure the base with our ally and that be exactly what we have do while china might support this terrible deal let tell the minister that the british people do not support this appalling deal give away our strategic security asset and pay ten of billion of our taxpayer money in the process our taxpayer will be suffer tax rise for that in order that the mauritians get tax cut since the government be in the mood for turn why do they not take the hint and turn on this terrible chagos deal will not take any lesson from party that fawn over vladimir putin in the defence secretary statement on may he state with regard to potential legal ruling against we that the most proximate and the most potentially serious be the international tribunal for the law of the sea official report may vol the us which operate the base be not even signatory to unclos how would itlos have rule bind legal judgment that we would have recognise it be notable that itlos have not be mention since that statement be confused have mention itlos on number of occasion include just moment ago the long stand view of the united kingdom be that the uk would not have realistic prospect of successfully defend its legal position on sovereignty in such litigation even if we choose to ignore bind judgment make against we we would not do so their legal effect on third country and international organisation would give rise to real impact to the operation of the base and the delivery of its national security function international organisation have already adopt decision base on mauritian sovereignty and other would follow suit follow such litigation that could affect the electromagnetic spectrum access to the base by air and by sea and the ability to patrol the maritime area around the base and to support the base critical national security function far the uk would likely face provisional measure order in matter of week the position be clear and we have explain it the hon member previous government know exactly the same interruption however much he shout and however much he do not like the argument they be the fact will the minister confirm that year ago the most disgusting cynical injustice be do against the chagos islander and that it be their resolute campaigning over decade often alone with little friendship or support that eventually bring the whole case to international law and an opinion from the international court of justice which have bring about the situation we be now in instead of obsess with the twilight of empire should opposition party not be think about the injustice do to the chagos islander will the minister confirm that in the arrangement now be make the chagos islander wherever they be resident and whatever their opinion be do have right of return will he give we some idea of what the attitude will be about the right of visit the right of residence and the right of return to diego garcia where the majority of the chagos islander have come from they be people who have be badly treat by history and be now be use as pawn by people more interested in defend some strange notion of the twilight of empire than justice for the chagos islander the primary purpose of the deal be of course to secure the base on diego garcia and the national security of the uk and our ally but the right hon member be right to point out the historical situation regard the chagossians we have express deep regret for how they be remove from the island in the and indeed that be on the face of the treaty we recognise the importance of the island to the chagossians as well as the different view in the community which he be well acquainted with we will be restart those visit include to diego garcia the programme of resettlement to island outside diego garcia will be for mauritius to determine but we have commit to member on the liberal democrat benches in the other place that we will provide further statement on how that will work in due course there be also the trust fund and the support we provide here in the uk we be listen to the different chagossian group and try to ensure that their interest be at the heart of the treaty deal as we move forward the minister will be aware of pende judicial review challenge focus on the lack of consultation with the chagossians why be there not full and adequate consultation with the chagossian people will not comment on ongoing judicial matter but as have set out number of time the negotiation be necessarily between the uk and mauritius however we recognise the importance of the island to chagossians which be why the measure that just set out have be put in place on point of order mr deputy speaker in answer to the hon member for st ives andrew george the minister seem to imply to opposition members ear anyway that the united states would be pay think he say large quantum of the funding for the deal think he be refer to the operational cost of the base may ask for confirmation that the united states be not contribute at all to the billion lease under the settlement order that be not point of order for the chair as the hon gentleman will appreciate but if the minister wish to respond will allow he to do so far to that point of order mr deputy speaker perhaps it be because of the noise and the shouting but be clear the united states contribute to the operation on diego garcia and rightly so there be establishment of that in relation to the exchange of note between the uk and the united states it be not contribute towards the cost of the treaty deal heathrow substation outage neso review with permission mr deputy speaker would like to make statement on the publication of the report from the national energy system operator follow its review into the fire at the north hyde substation on march neso review be commission jointly by the energy secretary and ofgem in the immediate aftermath of the fire which disrupt power

risk be not address by national grid electricity transmission key operator of our electricity system nget own guidance be clear and base on the elevated moisture sample that nget take in the asset should have remain out of service until mitigating action be put in place or the asset should have be carefully monitor until it could be replace nget fail to take action appropriate to the severity of the risk at north hyde that be most likely the cause of the catastrophic fire on march speak to nget this morning and make it clear that the finding be unacceptable and that action must be take to ensure that maintenance work on critical asset be prioritise appropriately fire suppression system must not be leave inoperable be pleased to see that the regulator be take swift action in response to the finding announce today that it be open an official enforcement investigation into nget ofgem will consider any possible licence condition breach relate to the development and maintenance of national grid electricity transmission electricity system at north hyde speak with ofgem yesterday to express my support for that investigation and the plan audit of national grid critical substation asset that will be essential to understand any other potential risk on the network and ensure that those be be mitigate appropriately the report also highlight that north hyde substation which be build in be subject to different design standard than new site that be build during the there be not sufficient distance or physical barrier between two transformer at north hyde which allow the fire to spread it be essential that we consider the potential risk create by differ design and standard across the electricity network particularly as we move towards clean power that will be key focus of the government response my department and ofgem will hold nget to account for its role in the incident at north hyde but the extent of the impact of the incident on heathrow operation must also come into focus heathrow airport ltd commission its own independent review the kelly review which be publish on may and investigate the circumstance that lead to the airport cease operation for most of march the review highlight several recommendation to far improve the resilience of the airport internal electricity network those align with neso finding that there be option to improve heathrow own power resilience which be the responsibility of heathrow and not national grid and reduce the risk of further disruption at this scale heathrow benefit from three separate supply point to the electricity network it be rare for any site to have such resilient connection to the network as no energy system can ever be free from disruption this be an opportunity for heathrow to consider invest in its internal electrical distribution network to take advantage of those multiple supply point welcome the continue effective collaboration between heathrow and energy operator as part of the review my department and the department for transport will work to ensure that that collaboration continue across those critical sector although such incident be rare and the uk have robust and resilient system there be always wide lesson to be learn the majority of recommendation make by neso in its report suggest potential improvement that could be consider by operator across the energy sector in collaboration with neso ofgem and other industry partner my department will ensure the delivery and implementation of those energy recommendation however the report finding be also applicable to wide government policy on resilience both in the energy sector and across other critical national infrastructure sector ensure the protection and resilience of critical national infrastructure continue to be key priority for government with action already be take the government recently publish year infrastructure strategy commit to strengthen resilience standard across critical national infrastructure far the cabinet office will imminently publish the uk government resilience action plan which will articulate government new strategic approach to resilience and be the outcome of the resilience review announce by the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster in this place last year my department be already take step to enhance our current approach to the designation of critical national infrastructure in the energy sector we recently introduce specific licence condition that give neso responsibility for datum gathering and technical analysis to independently inform the government decision on the designation of cni ensure our most critical infrastructure in the energy sector be always as resilient as possible we will work with the cabinet office and wide government to develop full response to the north hyde report and set out how we will tackle some of the cross sector resilience challenge highlight particularly give the importance of the energy sector for the continued operation of so much of our critical national infrastructure want to restate that great britain continue to have resilient energy network even though incident such as this be rare it be essential that we learn the lesson to maintain and where possible improve our resilience the government response will set out our plan for how we will continue to do so thank neso for carry out such comprehensive review over the past three month the report show the value of learn from past emergency such as this neso newly establish function in energy resilience will enable government the energy industry and the regulator to truly understand whole energy system risk and mitigation proactively ensure that great britain continue to have reliable energy supply which be critical to the whole of society commend this statement to the house before call the shadow secretary of state may take this opportunity to welcome she back to her place in the house thank you mr deputy speaker feel old wise and significantly more sleep deprive thank the minister for advance sight of his statement also thank neso for its rapid work the report be clear that there have be serious failing by national grid to fix an issue that it know about for seven year the minister be right that be unacceptable what be most important though be what happen now have some question for the minister first who at national grid make the decision to defer critical maintenance of the transformer in he say that he would hold they accountable so how will he do that he speak about breach licence condition what be the penalty for do that and what accountability mechanism will he use secondly the report say that the north hyde site do not meet modern standard on physical barrier between transformer can the minister confirm he have ask national grid to review substation with transformer build before the current standard be put in place thirdly what step will he take to look at the resilience of our energy system particularly in the light of the heighten geopolitical risk that we all face the key message that we should take from the report on the heathrow blackout be the importance of critical national infrastructure to our energy security and our national security in that regard it be the secretary of state for energy and climate change who be play with fire week after the blackout hit heathrow spain and portugal give we stark warning of what happen when country fail to protect their energy security public transport down payment system down and million of people unable to cook travel or contact their family tragically people lose their life in the case of north hyde the blackout affect school the london underground hillingdon hospital and customer some of whom have to move out of their home that be the price we pay when we do not take energy security seriously it be not nice to have energy be basic need and yet this government be put our energy at risk the national security strategy that the government publish just last week include mention of climate but not single mention of the risk that china pose to our energy system last year our intelligence service warn that chinese state sponsor hacker be work to disrupt and destroy critical infrastructure in the event of conflict and yet the secretary of state be rush to make britain dependent on chinese solar panel chinese rare earth and chinese battery in just five year time we have just see china limit the export of critical mineral in its trade war with the us we have see kill switch find in chinese inverter the us intelligence service have warn we about the risk of surveillance device in chinese wind turbine first write to the secretary of state eight month ago ask he to publish an assessment of what his target mean for our reliance on chinese import he have not even bother to reply if the secretary of state want to hand over the key of our energy supply to the chinese communist party he should come to this house and explain why we be lucky enough in this country to be surround by our own gas field but the secretary of state do not care this be man who would rather import gas from norway from the very same field in the north sea that he be ban britain from use who be pour concrete down our gas well and who be block off any contingency plan that britain might need in crisis do not say this lightly but this be man who be put our national security at risk today we be talk about the first transformer fire in decade in this country and he do not even bother to turn up that be the problem the secretary of state might prefer to be in brazil baku beijing or wherever he be today but he should be here to explain himself because as the former head of say he be pursue an energy policy that be completely crazy when it come to national security want clean energy from nuclear from small modular reactor and from the next generation of british innovation but first and foremost want energy that keep the light on and keep bill down this government be go to leave we completely reliant on foreign import from china from norway from qatar from anywhere as long as it be not britain neso and ofgem will do their work but the minister must do his work too alongside the work of the north hyde report can he confirm that he will come back and update the house on his plan to protect the energy resilience of this country be go to start and will regardless of the rest of that speech by warmly welcome the right hon lady back to her place as the shadow secretary of state will miss spar with my scottish colleague the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie although be sure we will still have opportunity to do so the right hon lady might come to miss the lack of sleep at home compare with the noise in this place but she be very welcome back she have obviously take the last few month to write wrap up speech on whole range of issue and be glad to give she the opportunity to pontificate here on many of those thing but let stick to the question that relate to the statement that have deliver to the house today the right hon lady ask about the role that national grid have play ofgem have open an enforcement investigation into this incident to get to the bottom of exactly what national grid have or have not do and whether there be possible breach of licence that investigation should now take its course there be clearly serious question to answer and that be exactly the point that put to national grid today have ask for an immediate response on what action it be take and for assurance that there be no further maintenance backlog that it have not act on and expect that by the end of this week ofgem have also instruct wide audit of maintenance work across the energy system which will identify if there be any similar issue on the point about be hold accountable clearly be go to wait for the outcome of ofgem investigation it be the responsibility of ofgem as the regulator to determine whether national grid be in breach of any of its licence condition and what the appropriate action should be if it be will wait for those finding to come through the right hon lady raise an important point about the physical barrier clearly there be difference because the time at which some of our infrastructure be build and the different standard that be in place at different time we need to make wide review to see what be actually possible with some of this infrastructure it be not always possible to build to the standard we now expect but everything that be be build now be be build to the high standard want the same assurance that she have call for to know that anything that be build previously be safe on the wide resilience question be not go to get into back and forward on the frankly quite ludicrous claim that the right hon lady make hope this be not an indication of the tone we can expect in the year ahead because there be some difficult decision for we all to wrestle with there be the really important question about deliver our energy security in as she say an increasingly uncertain world we be sprint towards clean power to remove the volatility of fossil fuel from our system she oppose all of that investment there be also critical role to play in upgrade the network infrastructure across the country which her party also oppose there be some really search question for the conservatives who be of course in charge of this infrastructure for year about their role and what part they want to play it be easy to shout from the sideline with accusation it be far more useful and important for party that be in government for year and be now the official opposition to come up with some credible question about how we deliver the energy system of the future we be go to get on with deliver it call the chair of the energy security and net zero committee it beggar belief that no action be take after the risk be identify in at the north hyde substation the neso report highlight lack of information sharing internally at national grid and externally between organisation it draw attention to the energy company not know that heathrow have to hour arrangement for switch supply and that national grid do not appear to know that heathrow be customer of the substation it be matter of immense luck that the explosion and fire take place at at night and that no one be present otherwise this would have be very different discussion with people have die the minister highlight the unacceptable lack of action by national grid will he ensure proper oversight and information share internally at national grid and externally between organisation so that we have safety and resilience in our national energy system where it apply to critical national infrastructure and beyond first on the point about join up my hon friend be absolutely right the response that have see from national grid identify that as one of the point it will take away it will look at information sharing and join up the datum in various system and at how to ensure that be follow through on it be important to say that there be also learn not just for national grid but across the energy system through look at what other transmission owner do and at what the government do around share information where we can there be lot of learning and lot of recommendation will be take forward on the question of heathrow much be identify in the kelly review which look specifically at these operation on the question of whether there be single point of failure at heathrow the airport be one of the big consumer of electricity in the country and one of our most important piece of critical national infrastructure it be important that those at heathrow reflect on this report and take some lesson from it the report have show this be lesson for everyone the importance of invest in electricity resilience and prepare for the bad even if we think there be low chance of the bad actually happen completely agree with my hon friend final point it be in all our interest to spend time effort and investment in make sure that our energy system continue to be as resilient as possible call the liberal democrat front bench spokesman this report be an utterly damn assessment of our national resilience this time through decay but also through lack of readiness as the climate crisis change the dynamic with old equipment operate at high temperature just as the load for climate control and air conditioning be at their peak the british people will rightly be alarmed that the problem that cause this substation failure be know as long ago as but there be much wide point here beyond the technicality of this failure the resilience of critical national infrastructure have be neglect for far too long as an engineer come to this place for precisely this reason we be too short termist and too narrow in our vision we can not possibly expect to remain world leader in infrastructure if we can not future proof and seriously invest in the resilience of our asset building and maintain infrastructure might not get pulse race there be no ribbon to cut when something just continue to operate efficiently but that long termism be an ideology that we should all get behind if we be serious about britain future the report outline the many miss opportunity to fix the issue at the substation and we will all have to look seriously into ofgem consequential investigation into national grid once it be publish this be not just about grid resilience though this time it be fire cause by fault but next time it might be deliberate cyber attack or an act of terrorism which could have more disastrous impact we must look beyond the short term with strategic and long term plan to join up national infrastructure and make it safe and reliable for all the government must bring about strategy and act quickly to review the resilience of all similar asset include every uk airport they be all critical to our national economy and our society with that in mind can the minister confirm whether an assessment have be make of the likelihood of repeat of this incident at heathrow and at all other piece of critical national infrastructure also be the government take this opportunity to finally pick up the national infrastructure commission report from and which be ignore by the previous government and the report from which be not implement quickly enough and to implement standard and framework for resilience in key sector such as aviation telecom water and energy which will future proof our age infrastructure to make it reliable and safe the hon gentleman be absolutely right to broaden this beyond the electricity system and north hyde to take in wide question around critical national infrastructure he be also right about invest in the future always think that grid and network set the heart race little fast but that be just this be important and this government be invest in this infrastructure just this week ofgem announce record investment in it hope give the importance of this statement that member on all side of the house will recognise the importance of that investment on the point around wide resilience the cabinet office be lead on try to bring together what think it be fair to say have be too fragmented landscape in resilience across government my department be responsible for number of key risk in the national risk register it be right that the lead departments have expertise in certain area but if that information be not share coherently across government we increase the chance of not get the answer right lot of work be be do in that regard we be also look at how we share datum across all sector of critical national infrastructure within government we will say more about that in the resilience action plan which the cabinet office be work on at the moment of course the year infrastructure strategy be also about how we will invest for the long term in the infrastructure that keep our country run call the chair of the science innovation and technology committee speak as chartered electrical engineer and as the chair of the science innovation and technology committee be absolutely amazed that such an important and large part of our critical national infrastructure in the national grid be not properly maintain for seven year and that heathrow the busy airport in the world have single point of failure the minister have outline some of the process and procedure that will follow but will he say how he intend to improve the standard of engineering maintenance culture and excellence in our critical national infrastructure which have clearly be allow to fall significantly under successive conservative government first it be important to say that heathrow have multiple route into its electricity network three in fact which be unique this report and the process identify in the kelly review will give heathrow airport ltd pause for thought on what it need to do on how its network be configure and how it can adapt in such situation of course this be an incredibly rare circumstance but the whole point of resilience planning be to plan for eventuality that we think be extremely unlikely to happen but that would have significant impact if they do heathrow closing be clearly one such circumstance secondly my hon friend be right to highlight standard and system want to be careful not to prejudge the review that ofgem have announce because there be something to be say about standard change over time maintenance backlog obviously then have to be meet and if the issue be that maintenance that should have be carry out have not be that be clearly an issue we will take forward but if it be just that piece of infrastructure be subject to standard that have change over time we have wide question of how we can adapt some of that infrastructure for future standard we will look at all those point repeat to the house that our electricity system be incredibly robust in its resilience we need to do everything possible to make it even more robust so that such instance do not have quite so significant an impact as this one do may follow up on that and ask the minister whether he will undertake to have full frank and open discussion with the relevant directorate within his department about what it have learn from this disaster in particular what exercise tabletop or virtual must be undertake to practise resilience in the event of future such failure my right hon friend the member for east surrey claire coutinho be right to warn about the increase fragility of energy security in this country there be plenty of informed opinion that support that view have speak to colleague across the department on these question they be rightly constantly look at how we review our process importantly they be also work outside of government and try to break down some of the silos so we be co ordinating with different part of government that have different responsibility but the right hon member be right and we will constantly push to do more of that the question of exercise be important we have really significant exercise under the previous government which look at the government response to significant power outage we be put in place many of the recommendation from that exercise which be important to take forward but more exercise be useful would slightly separate the response from the infrastructure itself fail which be what we need to investigate quickly the kelly review set out that heathrow response to the incident be in line with its response plan although the outcome be clearly not what any of we would have want it go to wide question about the infrastructure at heathrow not so much the actual plan put in place when the incident do occur those be two slightly different thing but they be both extremely important too thank the minister for make this statement and neso for this damn report heathrow airport ltd power set up internally virtually guarantee hour of disruption in scenario like this on march that mean over quarter of million passenger be affect airline lose significant revenue for which they will not be compensate and countless time critical freight load be also affect yet in spain and portugal airport do not close when those country have full power outage by any definition surely heathrow airport count as critical national infrastructure as it undeniably require operational continuity note that the minister confirm the airport responsibility for its own power resilience but do the government have role in ensure that end to end power supply to critical national infrastructure be robust and that risk like power outage be manage adequately thank my hon friend for the question and for her thank to neso which have do comprehensive job on this report in fairly short space of time there be lesson to be learn for heathrow and it will be learn those lesson be in communication with the transport secretary who of course have immediate responsibility for heathrow as piece of critical national transport infrastructure it be worth say that its back up generator do operate in the way they be suppose to but heathrow be huge piece of infrastructure and it be not intend that those back up process would continue to run normal operation in huge airport beyond the immediate situation of be able to land plane safely and ensure other critical system within the airport the question heathrow have to answer be on have three point of electricity generation come into the airport it clearly need to look at the way the network be configure and take forward the wide question of its resilience and ability to adapt to such situation the government have an incredibly important role as my hon friend rightly say and we will do all we can to ensure that national grid be do its bit that the distribution operator be do what it need to do and that heathrow airport ltd be also meet the expectation that we would expect from our most important piece of transport infrastructure call the snp spokesperson the report by neso have clearly uncover serious structural failing at national grid but let we not forget that the government response to the outage be severely want as well on the monday follow the outage the transport secretary confirm that she be rely on the content of three day old conversation with heathrow with no assessment from the government and no conversation with national grid can the secretary of state assure the house that sufficient lesson be be learn in government to ensure that when the power supply to critical national infrastructure be affect in the future the government be not leave without answer again additionally member will understand the phrase quis custodiet ipsos custode mean who guard the guard why do it take such serious outage for the national grid to be audit like this surely well oversight may have identify the shockingly poor risk management since do not realise in my statement early this week that the hon gentleman be now the snp energy spokesperson welcome he to his place hope he will bring the same customary sunshine that his predecessor in the role do to our deliberation in this place on the incident itself clearly there be lesson to be learn from the way the energy infrastructure work on and march and for heathrow on the configuration of its internal network and how that work the incident itself be clearly one we want to avoid at all cost but actually the process be carry out safely passenger be inform and the disruption be keep to an absolute minimum but if an airport such as heathrow close there will be disruption be not sure that take the hon gentleman criticism of the handling of the incident he be right on the broad point about how we ensure we be regularly audit the process of maintenance work go forward the three transmission owner in the uk have responsibility for do that and that be regulate by ofgem which regularly check on this the second part of ofgem review announce today will look specifically at whether those maintenance backlog and any other long stand issue have be resolve and look at the lesson we can learn on ensure that those process actually happen and that we do not just have thing sit on list but not actually deliver the substation be locate in my constituency and be there on the day the incident happen it be massive fire and of my constituent be evacuate from their home during the night and there be smoke flow down the street it could have be much big disaster have it not be for the courageous firefighter who go on to the site the help they get from the council the back up service and the nhs place on record the house congratulation to they and our admiration for what they do my constituent want to be reassure but the report demonstrate catalogue of failure the problem be identify in we be now seven year on welcome the right hon member for east surrey claire coutinho back to her place but sleep deprivation can affect the memory her party be in government for most of that period be worried that site like this could be easily target by terrorist activity so we need process of reassurance the recommendation set out in the review about what we do from here to ensure resilience have to take into account that the government have role in drive through the programme we have to recognise that we can not rely on some of the other agency without real government thrust of leadership but also secure accountability because do not want other area to experience what we experience that night thank the right hon gentleman for his remark and for the way he make they he be absolutely right to recognise the heroic role that our emergency service play on the night be sorry that do not say that at the start of my statement as well as the engineer who work in incredibly hard in difficult circumstance in the hour that follow the fire to try to get service reconnecte as quickly as possible there be very serious question to answer and hope that come through in my statement it certainly come through in the conversation have with national grid early we be seek urgent assurance that the work that should have be do be be do and that there be no other similar situation ofgem be take the matter seriously with two review one into national grid and the other into the wide energy system to see if there be any further lesson to learn however the right hon gentleman be right and completely agree with his point that the government need to be front footed and take leadership role in drive the work forward we can not leave it to individual company to mark their own homework we be do that partly by bring together our resilience work across government and will soon be chair new group that bring together everyone who have responsibility for critical national infrastructure in our energy system to ensure that energy security cyber security and other threat to our infrastructure be take seriously so that action be take at the high level of government to ensure that we do not have repeat of the incident in future the substation by heathrow be probably one of the most important in the country yet this damn report say that there be catastrophic failure of maintenance give that national grid also fail to recognise how close we come to national blackout early this year we have to ask be national grid grossly negligent and do the minister still have full confidence in its management the hon gentleman may be confuse two thing the national energy system operator be no long part of national grid as it be make into publicly own company by the previous government which be introduce by we when we come into government so the national energy system operator be responsible for manage the energy system and it be different from national grid which be private company that operate the electricity network in england so those two organisation be slightly different of course he be right to highlight the scale of the failure that be why have give statement today and why number of serious action be be take which will be follow up in serious way we do not come close to blackout early this year it be important to repeat that because there be lot of misinformation about particular set of statistic that be misunderstood by some people we have never come close to that and we have never have national power outage in our history the aim of all the work that we do be to build as safe and resilient an electricity system as we can so that when circumstance like this happen because fire and accident do happen we will have do everything that we could have do to have mitigation in place when such fault be down to failure of maintenance we must ensure that be take account of and never happen again like any serious incident this one have multiple cause both operational and relate to design urge the minister to ensure that the lesson learn be apply not only to electricity transmission and distribution site but to energy storage site for which we have an absence of standard he rightly mention the need for redundancy and flexibility in our electricity system and the need to avoid have single point of failure that apply well to large piece of essential infrastructure but be hard with our distribute critical infrastructure for example around telecommunication so we need diversity in our energy system as whole do he agree that in our energy system we need widespread availability from multiple part of the energy sector with electricity be back up by for example hydrogen and ammonia my hon friend always remind how much he know about many of these issue it be hugely welcome he be right there be wide lesson to be learn across the system and not just for large critical national infrastructure as he say we have grid that have many more power station of different form than we have ever have in the past there be also lesson to be learn for storage which be rightly become increasingly important for our energy mix on his wide point about telecom in the wake of the storm early this year we take number of action to make our electricity system more resilient our use of telecommunication equipment in this country be change very few people now have access to traditional copper wire phone so when telecom equipment go down there be an immediate significant impact on people life recently meet the minister for data protection and telecoms in the department for science innovation and technology to discuss this issue we will work with ofcom and the operator to ensure that the telecom infrastructure be as resilient as it can be point of order on point of order mr dirprwy lefarydd privy counsellors can request and receive confidential briefing on urgent matter and that make it possible for they to come to fully inform decision on matter of national security that be particularly pertinent for today motion on the proscription of palestine action could you advise on how be to make an informed decision when my request for privy council briefing on palestine action be refuse this week thank the right hon lady for give notice of her point of order she will understand that this be not matter for the chair but she have put an important concern on the record trust that member on the treasury bench will have take notice of it far to that point of order mr deputy speaker can you consult the speaker office on whether before the start of the debate on the statutory instrument on the prevention of terrorism anything can be do to ensure that the three organisation list can be vote on separately that would be the proper way for member of the house to express their view thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order be afraid that his request be simply in procedural term not possible the chair be not responsible for the forming of such motion the motion will be put to the house as it be on the order paper public authority accountability motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to set requirement on public institution public servant and official and on those carry out function on their behalf to act in the public interest and with candour and frankness to define the public law duty on they to assist court official inquiry and investigation to enable victim to enforce such duty to create offence for the breach of certain duty to provide funding for victim and their relative in certain proceeding before the court and at official inquiry and investigation and for connected purpose on april enter hillsborough stadium an innocent year old full of hope and excitement to watch my beloved liverpool football club in the fa cup semi final little do or anybody else there that day know that we be walk into national disaster that would leave man woman and child dead hundred more injured and countless family devastate for generation what unfold that day be not tragic accident it be disaster cause by police failure and compound by one of the most shameful state cover up this country have ever see like so many other be just working class lad who happen to be there but like so many other be drag into decade long web of establishment denial distortion and deceit that day shape and the course of my life and it be the reason stand here today we have all witness the bravery determination and anguish of the hillsborough family and survivor who be fight tirelessly for truth and justice in the face of repeat state obstruction we never seek revenge or ask for special treatment we just want what anyone would want in our shoe the truth about what happen to our love one and fair chance at justice instead we be meet with wall of silence decade of lie and legal system stack against we be so honoured that some of those tireless campaigner and giant of justice be in the house today watch as we fight once again to end the injustice they have endure for more than three decade police officer know who be responsible and where accountability lie yet lie after lie be tell at inquest and inquiry and in medium briefing supporter be blame for the death of their fellow fan time and again false narrative be repeat and legitimise by those in power and we will never ever forget or forgive the disgraceful headline in the sun while the family and survivor scrap together fund for legal representation those responsible be shield by some of the fine legal mind in the country insultingly pay for by the state remember vividly my dad who be seriously injure that day fundraise in the breck our local pub near anfield for the hillsborough justice campaign that grassroots organisation be power by ordinary people not the treasury and the contrast could not be starker be very proud that he be here today grieve family fight for justice while the institution responsible be protect at every turn by system design to shield itself it be not broken system it be system work exactly as it be design to system in which the establishment protect its own and in which ordinary people like my dad and thousand of other be treat as an inconvenience through the real truth legacy project we teach schoolchildren about hillsborough and other example of state injustice because this history must not be bury it must be understand crucially it must never be repeat when speak to student about the fight for truth compare it to somebody who be blindfold and who have their hand tie behind their back have to go toe to toe with tyson fury that be what those family face and still face to this day this be not just about hillsborough although the legislation bear its name for decade we have see the same institutional playbook use time and again the cover up the smear the hostile briefing and the dragging out of justice until people simply give up or pass away we have see grenfell manchester arena the post office horizon scandal infect blood the truth about zane campaign nuclear test veteran and so many more each time we see the same weary expression on the face of the devastated family and the same exhaustion etch on to the face of those battle system design to protect itself each time it happen little more faith in this country soul be lose today we have the power to change that as the parliamentary lead for the hillsborough law now campaign be proud to reintroduce this legislation the public authority accountability bill be proud but deeply disappointed because this bill should already be in law in my right hon and learn friend the member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer stand before the people of liverpool at the labour party conference and pledge that one of my first act as prime minister will be to put the hillsborough law onto the statute book he say the same again as prime minister in september and mention not hillsborough law but the hillsborough law that pledge fill our heart with hope and promise an end to the culture of denial and delay and the decade of deceit make no mistake this bill be the hillsborough law the one draft by pete weatherby kc and elkan abrahamson it be the one originally introduce by andy burnham in and shape by the family for the family it include statutory duty of candour on public authority enforceable with criminal sanction it level the play field so that family be no long the underdog in the courtroom it create genuine accountability mechanism so that state cover up be much hard to conceal and the truth be much hard to bury this bill be for the but also for the victim of every other state failure and for every family who might in future face the nightmare of be leave alone to fight for truth and justice despite the promise in in march this year the government bring forward water down version replacement bill not the hillsborough law that the prime minister promise they present it to the legal expert who write the original bill and those expert say unequivocally that it fall far short because it have no legally bind duty of candour no provision for equal legal funding during inquest and inquiry and loophole allow public body to avoid disclosure worse still that draft follow family listening day organise by the brilliant organisation inquest at which ministers hear directly from the family of the bereaved include hillsborough family those family make their view crystal clear and their expectation be even clear the result report be not ambiguous it be entitle all or the government return with hollow offering that deliver nothing of what be promise follow widespread outrage from campaigner that draft bill be thankfully and rightly shelve but we understand that new replacement bill still without the key provision of the hillsborough law could be imminent this time it will not be share with the family or campaigner in advance what do that say about the lesson learn the resistance to the hillsborough law be root not in legal complexity but self preservation it be be lead by those with the most to lose senior official and institution who fear scrutiny more than they value accountability let be absolutely crystal clear this law will not weaken public institution but strengthen they it will protect the vast majority of decent hard work public servant who if pressure to conceal the truth will finally have the law on their side it will deliver justice more swiftly and affordably reduce the need for draw out and expensive inquiry and inquest that cost the public purse hundred of million of pound this legislation be right here it be write ready and require no redrafting and no more stalling what it require be political will just last week mp and lords from across these houses sign letter urge the prime minister to honour his pledge the support span party region and generation and that cross party unity reflect the will of the public they do not want another whitewash or betrayal they want integrity and action let close with this the law can not bring back the erase the decade of pain or undo the trauma inflict by callous lie and institutional neglect but it can stop this ever happen again it can give truth fight injustice and restore some of the faith lose not just in the system but in the very idea of justice say loud and clear to the prime minister do not let this moment slip away do not let your promise make in

the armed forces commissioner bill have return to this house the last time we be here full month ago explain that the bill already deliver what the other house have insert be therefore disappointed that the amendment in the name of baroness goldie seek to replace the government amendment with other amendment which be afraid be deeply flawed will explain why to be absolutely clear we be all in agreement about the intention behind the lords amendment defence personnel must feel empower and protect in come forward with their concern and absolutely agree that we need to address and eliminate toxic behaviour and culture in our armed force this government be commit to do exactly that which be the whole reason we be shin light on the welfare matter of our people and legislate for an independent champion in the form of the armed forces commissioner commend the minister and the government for bring this bill forward and understand the issue speak to the minister just beforehand lord amendment deal with whistleblower and protection for family member which be necessary have complaint ready to hand to the minister that be facilitate by family member watch the effect on their love one do the minister agree that it be right and proper that love one have mechanism for ensure the right thing be do by those who be legitimately whistleblowe thank the hon member for his intervention and agree with he it be precisely for that reason that the government be insist on our amendment and not accept the opposition amendment make in the other place because that amendment do not include family member agree that include love one family member for the purpose of the wording of the bill within the remit of the armed forces commissioner be an important new step in provide not just member in uniform but their immediate family member as define in the secondary legislation that will accompany the bill with the opportunity to raise general service welfare matter agree that there be lot more we can debate on these matter and there will be an opportunity to do so during the passage of the next armed force bill however say to all member that be concerned that go round again on this matter only hold up delivery of key element that will be use to tackle the very issue this amendment seek to address namely it hold up the establishment of an armed forces commissioner which be key manifesto commitment for defence the long this bill be prevent from become law the great the disservice we do to our armed force and their family sincerely hope that today we can send united message from this house that we do not wish to delay this vital legislation any far like everyone else in this house be incredibly proud of our armed force and particularly of our relationship with they in st helens just yesterday the duke of lancaster regiment parade through st helens town centre after be award the freedom of the borough we be so incredibly proud do the minister agree that we just need to get on with this now so that we can show united front and speak with one voice in support of our armed force and give they the support they need thank my hon friend for place on the record the military event in his constituency it be so important that we recognise the link and tie that so many of our military unit have with the locality from which they recruit where they be base and where they serve agree with his broad point the time be right for we to pass this bill get it into law and allow we to move to situation in which we have an armed forces commissioner able to deal with the issue raise by our people and their family member the government take on board the important debate in both houses and propose amendment to which this house previously agree that amendment honour the spirit of the noble baroness amendment in the other place and actually go far than her proposal deliver concrete legal protection that be not include in the amendment that be back before we today we be seek to reinsert that well amendment which be make early in the process and in good faith follow discussion and co operation with the opposition in the other place give the strong cross party support for the bill and clear argument in favour of the amendment in lieu we have be hop that that would enable we to conclude proceeding the government amendment will establish genuine protection for people wish to raise concern anonymously and will build trust and confidence among our armed force and their family in way we can not envisage will be achieve by the propose amendment that be before we today be very happy to serve on the committee for the armed forces commissioner bill while it be proceed through this place as the minister know there be large amount of consensus about the need for that process to conclude as quickly as possible and recently write an article with my hon friend the member for portsmouth north amanda martin about the need to give our armed force the reassurance that this government be take action to support they and their family do the minister agree that it really be time to get on with this we have consensus in this house that the armed forces commissioner should be able to begin work as quickly as possible thank my hon friend for his intervention and for the work he have be undertake with my hon friend the member for portsmouth north amanda martin the armed forces commissioner be key manifesto promise make at the general election and make with the deliberate intent of provide an independent voice an independent champion for those people who serve we know that for many of our people some of the service welfare matter be not good enough include childcare and the poor state of military accommodation the ability of the commissioner to raise those issue investigate they and use the additional new power not currently available to the service complaints ombudsman be substantial step forward for our people and key plank of renew the contract between the nation and those who serve agree with my hon friend that would like to see that get into law briefly will remind the house of the protection currently afford to the armed force one thing have be make aware of during these debate and discussion be that it be worth repeat some of those so that there can be no doubt about they all defence personnel be protect in relation to whistleblowe under exist defence policy which enable individual to raise and resolve issue in way that be protect and secure and do not lead to wrongful disclosure of official information the armed force operate within different legal and constitutional construct to that of civilian so they be not explicitly cover by the public interest disclosure act pida however as matter of policy under this government and the previous government the ministry of defence already recognise and adhere to the criterion for protect disclosure and it follow the prescribed procedure and protection for those make qualifying disclosure the mod will not tolerate any form of victimisation of an individual for raise genuine concern the government amendment be support by further non legislative commitment which take together far bolster trust and confidence in the armed forces commissioner in that respect they include review and update the ministry of defence policy and protection relate to raise concern which would include whistleblowe in the sense we be discuss it today to be clear the government recognise the importance of due protection for whistleblower indeed just this week the cabinet office be host whistleblowing conference bring together policy representative from across government to review the current whistleblowing framework and discuss forthcoming change under the employment rights bill that bill contain new clause strengthen protection for people wish to make protect disclosure under pida and explicitly recognise sexual harassment as ground for protect disclosure the ministry of defence raise concern policy will be review and update to reflect these change and we welcome the interest of member from all party in that process what proportion of the commissioner time and that of his or her staff do the minister envisage be devoted to individual matter of casework of the sort he have just describe and what proportion will be around thematic investigation such as the state of service housing that be genuinely fair question the bill be draft in such way that there be no obligation or requirement for any commissioner who be appoint to resource accord to government position it be for the armed forces commissioner to decide the allocation of resource and energy however the german armed force model from which we have take inspiration undertake two to three thematic investigation year with dedicated team use feedback from people who have raise concern officially and from those get in touch to raise an issue but not necessarily expect it to be deal with as casework the majority of the resource due to the casework function relate to correspondence but it would be for the uk armed forces commissioner to make that determination the bill provide the power to do that let come to the amendment from the other place because the power relate to whistleblowing be key part of why we do not think the amendment be suitable first the use of whistleblower be inappropriate in this context despite the value we place on the function although more recently the use of the term have be more relaxed and raise concern and whistleblowing be use interchangeably engagement in under the previous government with the whistleblowing charity protect suggest that the term might be put people off come forward today we be talk about law rather than the policy that will be implement although the term whistleblowing appear in few limited circumstance in law there be no single agree definition of whistleblowing in uk legislation simply use the term in this bill as propose by the opposition lords amendment and would therefore have no practical legal effect and would provide no protection that do not already exist or be not already provide for in the government amendment in lieu terminology aside have several real concern about the new amendment insert in the other place the whistleblow investigation propose by these amendment have the same scope as the current investigation on general service welfare matter provide for by the bill but none of the associated power of investigation so the amendment do not allow the commissioner to access site to assist their investigation they do not allow the commissioner to access information or document to assist their investigation they do not require the secretary of state to co operate assist and consider any finding or recommendation as be the current wording and the amendment do not require report to go to the secretary of state or to be lay before parliament the scope of the amendment be therefore considerably narrower issue raise under the propose new clause can relate only to people subject to service law namely the man and woman of our armed force and not family member as say in reply to the hon member for strangford jim shannon and can not be about term of service the commissioner would need to consult the individual before start an investigation constrain their independence and possibly lead to junior staff face pressure from senior to withhold consent the anonymity protection would relate only to investigation under this propose new clause which be unlikely ever to be use for the reason that have set out it also remove the anonymity protection that the government propose to include more importantly however the bill be intend to provide safe route for people to come forward with their concern and know that they will be consider by truly independent figure we want people to feel secure and empower to raise those concern and we want the commissioner to have the full range of power as provide for in the bill to deal with all matter raise with they the amendment would restrict the power available to the commissioner to deal with complaint raise through this process do not believe that be really what the house want to see on whistleblowing the minister will remember westminster hall debate think it be last week in which inaccurately and over optimistically refer to this as the armed forces commissioner act not realise it be still go back and forth between here and the other place be correct by the shadow defence minister the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois assume it be friendly correction of my misunderstanding about process have correctly understand that what be go on be some kind of political difference over the use of the word whistleblower which have lead to badly draft amendment be insert into the bill that amendment will weaken the bill and reduce its ability to do what be intend at the same time it will delay thing when the department be at the point of be able to advertise for and appoint an armed forces commissioner someone to be in that role fight for the welfare of our armed service personnel hope that this be not party political issue because many of the member raise concern about whistleblowe in the other place be do so because they recognise that cultural issue within our armed force need to be address and to get clarity on what the government seek to do hope that from the statement that my colleague lord coaker have make to the other place and from the remark have make at this dispatch box colleague can feel reassure that we take issue of culture harassment and abuse seriously and we be clear that there be no place for they in our armed force we be update the policy and procedure on whistleblowe and raise concern from the policy we inherit from the last government so as to improve it and take it far we recognise that the employment rights bill will far strengthen that realise that the opposition do not support the employment rights bill but we do and it will far enhance the protection for whistleblower by update these policy and by include the cross government learn that our colleague in the cabinet office be co ordinating at the moment we will have strong policy hope that my place that on the record here as my noble friend lord coaker will do in the other place when the bill return there will be enough for those member who be concerned to be satisfied that the government have genuine desire to address these issue and that the amendment as draft create narrow scope for the commissioner and would prevent they from achieve their objective due to the wording it be therefore time to let the amendment fall away so that the bill can pass thank my hon friend for his intervention and assure he that he be not the only person who get intervene on by the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois for clarification we be always grateful for his knowledge when he do so we have deliberately draft the bill to be as broad clear and inclusive as possible and through our communication campaign and guidance that we have already announce we will make it clear to anyone who be subject to service law that they and their family can approach the commissioner to raise general service welfare matter however big or small and whether it affect they directly or not in that respect it provide for the intended function of the amendment make it explicitly clear that the power to initiate investigation base on information provide by the commissioner already exist in the bill in addition there be exist policy and procedure in place for people in defence to raise concern that fall outside the definition of general service welfare matter such as fraud or criminal activity recognise protection be already in place for those matter all defence civil servant be cover by the protection provide by pida and all military personnel be provide those same protection through exist defence policy our commitment to review and update defence policy and process in conjunction with the protection that be already in place for both civilian and member of our armed force plus the deficiency in the amendment insert by the other place mean that now be the time for both houses to do the right thing and bring the bill into law at the early opportunity lord coaker and will be write to the opposition spokespeople in the other place be grateful for the engagement that have already take place both between baroness goldie and lord coaker and between the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire baroness kramer and to address their concern in detail to provide write assurance about the change we be make that confirm what have say at the dispatch box today and to invite their contribution as we seek to develop and renew the raise concern policy therefore urge the house to support the government position to ensure that we can deliver this vital manifesto commitment for our brave servicemen and woman and their family as soon as possible call the shadow minister rise to address the lords amendment follow yet another government defeat in the other place as say last month when we last debate this important bill his majesty official opposition be drive by commitment to ensure that our brave servicemen and woman receive the robust transparent and fair support they deserve the bill which aim to establish an independent armed forces commissioner with ofsted like power to gain access to military site and information hold the potential to improve the welfare and accountability framework for our armed force if implement effectively it could significantly enhance public confidence in the way in which the concern of service personnel be address believe that this vision enjoy broad support across the house although yet again have to place on record that when we be discuss important legislation that affect the welfare and wellbeing of armed force personnel and their family no reform member of parliament be in the chamber of the house of commons they can not spend the whole of their life on tiktok particularly as it be chinese system our duty as his majesty opposition be to ensure that the bill deliver on its promise without introduce unnecessary complexity we must scrutinise the way in which the commissioner role integrate with the exist complaint system and what it mean for those navigate they today we focus again on the key issue of whistleblowing which be debate extensively in the other place and which now lie before this house yet again our amendment champion by baroness goldie seek to empower the commissioner to investigate whistleblowe concern relate to welfare and service issue while guarantee anonymity for those who come forward be they service personnel their family or other this be not radical proposal but reasonable compromise incorporate the exact wording of the government commons amendment on anonymity in report alongside our whistleblowing duty the government argue that exist mechanism confidential hotline investigation team and improve complaint process be sufficient and that our amendment do not confer additional power that stance be be afraid both inconsistent and unconvincing the minister own dear colleague letter of may generously acknowledge that baroness goldie amendment have spark an important debate yet the government resist embed clear statutorily protect whistleblowing function such provision be essential to ensure that vulnerable service personnel can raise concern without fear of reprisal lord coaker speak for the government in the other place on june claim that the term whistleblower and whistleblowing might deter individual from come forward cite cabinet office guidance that suggestion be plainly daft if the term whistleblowing be truly barrier why do the national health service successfully operate its freedom to speak up policy which explicitly use the term why do the children commissioner issue an annual whistleblowing report those example demonstrate that the term be not deterrent but recognised and effective framework for protect those who expose wrongdoing to argue otherwise undermine the very concept of whistleblowe regime across multiple sector and public service in the united kingdom the government far contend that whistleblowe lack clear legal definition that be simply untenable section of the armed forces act be entitle investigation of concern raise by whistle blower and section of the police reform act provide another clear statutory precedent those act show that include whistleblowe in legislation add tangible value ensure protection for those who raise concern if whistleblowing be robust enough for the police reform act and for the very act that this bill amend how can the government claim that it lack clarity or value in this instance that be totally inconsistent the government position be riddle with contradiction in committee our broad amendment to empower the commissioner be dismiss by the ministry of defence as be too wide ranging in spirit of compromise we narrow it to focus on welfare and service issue now the government claim that the revise amendment be too narrow and lack sufficient power lord coaker argue that our amendment if pass would limit the commissioner investigation to the same scope as current power without enable access to site information or document or require the secretary of state to co operate or report to parliament if the government believe that our amendment do not go far enough why do they not support it and propose their own broad amendment to enhance the commissioner power which would almost take we back to the status quo ante this inconsistency suggest reluctance to engage constructively as if argument be be pluck out of thin air to block progress lord coaker with whom deal when he be in this place and for whom for the avoidance of doubt have immense respect also claim that our amendment exclude family member and term of service issue and would apply only to those subject to service law that be incorrect our amendment define whistleblower as person subject to service law or relevant family member thus corporal sister for example could raise whistleblowing concern if the corporal face abuse or bullying by military colleague this provision ensure that family member have voice directly contradict the government assertion to the contrary let give brief theoretical example let we consider the possibility of whistleblower be someone who serve in the british army in northern ireland under operation banner that be an extremely topical issue at present as the minister will know give the government appal remedial order to excise key part of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act do not know whether all armed force personnel who serve in northern ireland have privately sign the parliamentary petition entitle protect northern ireland veterans from prosecutions but can say that as of today more than people have sign it we therefore look forward very much to debate in parliament on july on exactly that matter which be sure will be follow closely by the veteran community and their family this be not an angel on pinhead argument it be actually quite important the government assurance about anonymity and communication campaign to promote the commissioner role be welcome but insufficient campaign can be no substitute for clear statutory whistleblowing provision that service personnel can trust to be fair should add that when we debate the bill before the minister talk about the issue of trust repeatedly the other place recognise that deliver another cross party defeat to the government in the last fortnight by amend the bill to include robust anonymous whistleblowing route our amendment represent reasonable compromise align with the government own wording on anonymity while embed vital whistleblowing duty to block it would signal that the government be not serious about work constructively with the opposition to improve the welfare of our armed force personnel so urge they to accept this compromise in the interest of all who serve will listen closely to anything far that the minister have to say but if the government persist in offer assurance without statutory weight will have no choice but to test the opinion of the house our service personnel deserve system that hear their voice and protect their concern and if we carry on play ping pong well that be sport that be once quite good at call the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome lord amendment and table by baroness goldie in response to the government rejection of the original proposal these amendment be not about party politic they be table by conservative peer and support across the house of lords by liberal democrats and other they represent thoughtful pragmatic effort to address real and persistent problem the need for an armed forces commissioner who be not just complaint handler but an independent figure capable of receive and investigate whistleblowing disclosure about systemic welfare failure confidentially and without fear of reprisal welcome that the minister have engage with baroness kramer and however the government insistence on remove the lords amendment and replace they with something far more limited be deeply disappointing their approach diminish the ambition of the bill and miss critical opportunity to build genuine trust with service personnel and their family something that the commissioner must get right from the start or it will be near impossible to regain let we be honest about what be at stake behind the language of whistleblowing be real people soldier spouse and contractor who have see something go seriously wrong and want to make it right not for themselves but for other they be not file complaint they be raise the alarm yet again and again we have see these people let down unheard unsupported or even punish for speak out from the appalling housing condition endure by military family to serious allegation of abuse and misconduct the public have grow increasingly aware that internal complaint mechanism be not enough that be why introduce whistleblowe matter and why the lords amendment be so vital baroness goldie revise amendment and strike balance they would preserve the key element of whistleblow protection include statutory duty for the commissioner to protect the anonymity of those who come forward and they would respond directly to concern raise by the government by make it clear that report must not identify whistleblower without their consent the amendment would bring the armed forces commissioner in line with modern expectation of public service oversight from regulator and financial service to the nhs and beyond have whistleblowing channel alongside complaint function be now standard the government argue that include the term whistleblower in legislation could somehow deter people from come forward and refer to previous analysis undertake by the last government find this baffling the term be well establish in uk law understand by the public and associate with great protection it be clear accessible and trust and dilute or avoid it send precisely the wrong message the lords amendment would do more than close gap they would send message to our armed force community that parliament be listen and that we recognise their loyalty not just in word but in the system we put in place to protect they the liberal democrats have long call for fair deal for service personnel and their family we support the bill and the creation of the armed forces commissioner as soon as possible but to be effective the role must be equip with the right tool and must work from day one that mean give people confidential route to raise serious concern and let they know that they will be treat with dignity and protect by law will vote against the government motion to remove the lords amendment and urge all member to do the same baroness goldie have offer constructive and reasonable way forward her compromise amendment uphold the integrity of the bill would give the commissioner proper investigatory reach and most importantly would give service personnel and their family voice they can trust let we take this opportunity to make the bill strong and the culture of our armed force fair safe and more accountable agree with the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire that we should arm the commissioner with the right tool on day one that be precisely why do not want to accept an amendment that would restrict those tool and provide weak protection for people raise whistleblowe concern via propose route rather that the route that be already in the bill it be precisely because want the bill to work that be not accept weak amendment always find it useful to use the phrase flip it to see it to see whether something would work and want to try that here let we take the counterfactual if the government propose an amendment that would restrict the commissioner access to site in relation to whistleblowing complaint compare to normal complaint or an amendment that would restrict access to information and document assist an investigation for whistleblowing complaint rather than normal matter and that would restrict the requirement for the secretary of state to co operate assist or consider any finding or recommendation on whistleblowing complaint rather than normal complaint think this house would rightly reject it be afraid that be what the lords amendment would deliver narrow scope few power and less ability for the commissioner to investigate hope that the house can see from my remark that we believe in provide route for people to raise their concern anonymously we believe in the protection for it and we be update the raise concern policy that we inherit from the last government in order to deliver that work the bill should be pass and be make an act of parliament so that we can implement its provision as fast as we can the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois argue against the advice that his government issue he be well within his right to do so give his government be defeat but it be contrary to the position that exist until july do not support poor amendment have engage constructively and will continue to do so because it be right to do so that be the spirit of this government on this legislation and it will continue to be the case the right hon gentleman accuse the government of not be serious about work for our armed force personnel so let very clear do not accept less for our armed force personnel be not accept the amendment from the other place because they would provide few protection for people on the route that he suggest and few power for the commissioner to undertake that work believe that if it be not for the necessity to play some ping pong in this respect he would be agree with on this matter let we pass this bill put it in place and give our armed force and their family the independent champion that they so richly deserve have listen very carefully to what the minister have say but be afraid remain unconvinced think he use the phrase flip it to see it could offer he another one jaw jaw be well than war war baroness goldie have do great job in the other place in bring together people from across the political spectrum to concentrate on this very important matter recommend that the house vote against the government today in order to send the bill back to the other place where there should be all party negotiation include with government ministers to see if we can find way through as thing sit here and now be afraid we must press this into the division lobbies question put diane abbott jack abbott

committee to withdraw immediately reason to be report and communicate to the lords on point of order madam deputy speaker the digital markets competition and consumers act outlaw foreign government ownership of uk medium organisation set limit of on that process the government have now move that from to which be considerably high however there have be only marginal debate in statutory instrument committee my concern it have only just be pass be that that be major change it would have be fair if the government have set about have proper debate on it here in the chamber of the house of commons because newspaper ownership be very significant issue the other place will potentially get much large debate yet we be the elect house ask your advice madam deputy speaker on how we may raise the issue again thank the right hon member for give prior notice of this point of order it be not matter for the chair but his comment be now on the record defence beg to move that the draft armed forces act continuation order which be lay before this house on june be approve the draft order will address the constitutional requirement under the bill of rights that stand army and by extension the royal navy and the royal air force must receive the consent of parliament the draft order provide that consent by continue into force for another year the armed forces act the legislation that govern the armed force this debate usually take place in delegated legislation committee before return to the floor of the house for approval give the significance to the country of both the armed force and the democratic oversight that parliament provide it be fitting that the debate be today be afford time on the floor of the house that enable all member who wish to contribute to do so for as the strategic defence review have show we must put our people at the heart of defence know that on all side of the house there be strong support for our people parliament be require to renew the armed forces act every five year through primary legislation the next armed force bill be require to have obtain royal assent by december and in the intervene year it be to approve an annual order in council such as the one before we today the act provide nearly all the provision for the existence of service justice system it provide for the service offence and for the investigation of alleged offence the arrest hold in custody and charging of armed force personnel accuse of commit an offence wherever in the world they be serve on that last point draw the house attention to the explanatory memorandum to the order which state the extent of this instrument be the united kingdom the isle of man the channel islands and the british overseas territory except gibraltar there be distinct difference between the extent of uk legislation and how the jurisdiction of service law be apply the extent of any legislation be statement about in which separate legal jurisdiction the legislation form part of the law not extend to gibraltar simply mean that the act do not form part of gibraltarian law that be because gibraltar have make an agreement with the united kingdom that it will pass forward amendment to the act in its own legislation conversely service law apply to member of the armed force wherever they be in the world so effectively there be unlimited geographical jurisdiction with regard to our service personnel and in some circumstance civilian subject to service discipline include those base in or serve in gibraltar the act provide the legal basis for office such as the judge advocate general and the director of service prosecutions as well as the court martial the summary appeal court and the service civilian court it also set out the process for the accuse to be deal with by their commanding officer or to be try at court martial finally the act also contain provision that cover non service justice matter such as service complaint and the armed force covenant as such the next armed force bill will likely contain mixture of both service justice measure and non service justice measure look forward to work with member across the house when it be introduce in due course in addition we have commit to tackle the unacceptable behaviour that have plague defence in the past root out toxic behaviour that we see evidence of in our armed force there be no place for abuse in the uk armed force today debate come against backdrop of this government deliver for defence for our service personnel and for veteran by put people at the heart of our defence plan and renew the nation contract with those who serve combine with whole of society approach to our national resilience that be why last year we deliver the big pay rise for our armed force in year we follow that up with another above inflation rise recently that be why we have secure major housing deal to buy back over military home improve house for armed force family and save taxpayer billion we be invest billion to improve military accommodation over the course of this parliament that be why we have set new target to tackle the recruitment and retention crisis we inherit from the previous government the result of which be clear already inflow up outflow down and the army experience seven year high in application volume we be deliver for defence that be why we will be appoint an armed forces commissioner to improve service life and be make it easy for veteran to access care and support for our million valour network after all the government recognise that the world have change we be in new era of threat which demand new era for uk defence the strategic defence review publish last month will make britain safe secure at home and strong abroad and set path for the next decade and beyond to transform defence and end the hollowing out of our armed force that we have see over the past year decisive action have already be take we have step up and speed up support for ukraine sign the landmark trinity house agreement with germany start work at pace on new defence industrial strategy ensure defence be an engine for growth and implement the deep ministry of defence reform programme in decade all of that have be underpin by an increase in defence spending of nearly billion this year and commitment to reach in april in the next parliament and in the large sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war one of the fundamental tenet of the strategic defence review as the minister be now broaden this out be that we should be prepare to fight and defeat peer enemy by which be year from now why after all the hullabaloo about the much vaunted defence review have this government return to what in the be know as the year rule would say to the right hon member that his government leave our force hollow out and underfunde leave our force live in appal accommodation leave retention and recruitment crisis that mean that for every people join our force be leave and leave situation where morale fall each and every year for the last decade in every one of our service we be fix that we be get our defence back on track that be why the defence review set out the journey to transform our defence why the chancellor have provide additional financial resource this year and why the prime minister support the defence investment pledge at the recent nato summit something hope the right hon gentleman party will in due course bring itself to do we need to be ready to deliver for our defence and to stand with our ally and that be what we be do today we be end the hollow out and underfunding as someone who value defence sometimes more than his party loyalty as see in the previous parliament hope the right hon gentleman would welcome that indeed hope he have the opportunity to do so in moment when he stand up to speak be not sure there be much point in we just blame each other on this matter there be historical parallel in we be spend only of our national wealth on defence there be massive rearmament follow that and consensus on both side of the house and by we be spend the good part of of national wealth on it it would be much well if the two party try to work together on this matter and realise that we be face an existential crisis in the world and that thing be very different now from or or whenever and that we should work together to massively increase defence spending thank the right hon gentleman for that point and agree with what he say it be precisely the reason that when the defence secretary be the shadow defence secretary and when be the shadow minister for the armed forces we have position of cross party support on defence matter it be really important think that we get back to that place when our adversary look at the united kingdom they should see strong cross party support as indeed believe they do when we debate ukraine there be strong set of plan in our strategic defence review with increase defence funding get to figure we have not match in the past year there be real opportunity to send united message from this house to our adversary and to our people who serve hope that the right hon gentleman colleague on the front bench be listen to his comment as closely as be member have the opportunity to approve this order today know that the government be deliver on our pledge on very serious note the opposition have be accuse of be pro russia pro china and pro iran repeatedly by the prime minister which the minister have defend because we dare to oppose the chagos deal if he want unity we need to see that on both side of the house think the unity we see on the chagos deal be that the conservatives start deal and we finish it they agree it be the right thing to start negotiation and hold round and we agree it be the right thing to complete that deal we put our national security first in that respect secure the future of the diego garcia base and win the support of our us friend our nato ally our five eyes partner and india locally it be up to the hon gentleman which side of the debate he wish to be on we choose the side of our national security hon member can approve this order today know that we be deliver on the pledge to rewrite the contract between the united kingdom and those who serve in order to improve it the armed forces act and by extension this order underpin the very existence of his majesty armed force it back those who like my old man royal navy submariner and so many across this house step forward to serve our country and protect our united kingdom and our ally and partner in an era of global instability to deploy globally in support of british objective and to support our national security with the consent of the house today parliament will acknowledge pay tribute to and back their service the purpose of this instrument be to provide for the continuation in force of the armed forces act which would otherwise expire in mid december in essence the measure provide for the act to continue in force for further year take we up to deadline of december for those with an historical interest among whom include myself the principle of the legislation date back to the bill of rights as the minister intimated which give that it follow on from the civil war declare the raise or keeping of stand army within the united kingdom in time of peace unless with the consent of parliament to be against the law this provision have result in the requirement since that all legislation on discipline in the armed force be annually renew hence this order as the minister state this instrument should have support across the house and be sure that it do however yet again when we be debate defence when we be debate an order that be fundamental to the discipline and integrity of our armed force there be no reform mps in the chamber why it be because reform do not do defence the minister and have see that time and again over the past year so there be point of consensus if he want one while this order might appear to be mere formality albeit an important one it give the opportunity to ask my opposite number the minister for the armed forces four important question but before do will just report to the minister that the cadet who be an important part of the armed force family be indeed well disciplined and in good heart attend an armed forces day event in basildon on saturday as have do for year and be honour to be invite to inspect the air cadets on parade when ask one very smart cadet why he have decide to join the air cadets he reply because my mum make sir although three year in very grateful that she do also manage to grab quick drink with some veteran in local hostelry however mysteriously all four mp in the basildon borough none of whom be labour mp appear not to have be invite this year can only presume that our invitation be lose in the post say gently to the minister more in sorrow than in anger that play silly partisan game like this be demean for the labour lead council on that point will the right hon gentleman give way no armed forces day be too important for this sort of silly nonsense which embarrass basildon council in the eye of the public and indeed its local mps in all seriousness perhaps the minister could have word with his colleague on the council and make sure that this unfortunate oversight do not happen again defence be traditionally bipartisan issue we all believe in the defence of the realm and have always believe that it be the first duty of government however say to the minister on the floor of the house that he can not have it both way he can not on the one hand plead for unity between the government and the opposition and then when it suit imply that opposition spokesman be russian chinese or iranian fellow traveller just because they have the temerity not to agree with the government on their bonker chagos deal my honest advice to the minister be to make up his mind and be consistent he will then receive the respect that he ask for turn to the order armed forces act be normally subject to quinquennial review we have armed forces act in and and we can expect further act before the instrument expire in december give the vagary of parliamentary life few thing be certain but assume for moment that it will be the armed forces minister and who will take this legislation through on behalf of our respective party this seem good opportunity to ask the minister two question first what be the late timing for that legislation and when can we expect to see bill secondly could he give the house some idea of the likely key theme of that bill and the area if any in which the legislation be likely to differ materially from the armed forces act in fairness he drop hint few moment ago that there will be service justice provision perhaps he could expand on that slightly if he have the opportunity ask because there will be large number of interested party include the armed force themselves obviously the armed force family federation military charity and other from previous experience can say that they will take close and important interest in the bill give they as good head up as possible be clearly desirable perhaps the minister could assist the house with that as the explanatory note that the minister refer to point out be this order not to be pass the key effect would be to end the provision which be necessary to maintain the armed force as discipline body crucially the act confer power and set out procedure to enforce the duty of member of the armed force to obey lawful command without the act those power and procedure would no long have effect command officer and the court martial would have no power of punishment in respect of failure to obey lawful command or any other form of disciplinary or criminal misconduct member of the armed force would still owe allegiance to his majesty but the power of enforcement would be remove clearly that would be very undesirable and for the avoidance of doubt we will most certainly not vote against this order in few minute time but there be an important point here about member of the armed force be require to obey lawful command that bring on to my third question for the minister as recently as defence question on monday we debate in the chamber the fate of the or so british army veteran who serve in northern ireland on operation banner they be lawfully command to help uphold the rule of law in support of the royal ulster constabulary gc now the police service of northern ireland and to protect all people in northern ireland of whatever tradition from heinous act of terrorism whether by bomb or by bullet as the minister will be well aware the government have table so call remedial order that would cut out element of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act thus potentially open up some of those veteran to an endless cycle of investigation and reinvestigation the order also make it easy for the like of gerry adams and his compadre to sue the british taxpayer for hundred of million of pound accord to press report in the daily telegraph yesterday and an associated answer by the northern ireland secretary to parliamentary question the government have decide to drop the part of the remedial order that would assist mr adams and his associate in sue the british taxpayer if that report be true we conservative members would warmly welcome it however it do not solve the problem of our brave veteran who serve in northern ireland often be persecute at the behest of sinn féin whenever my right hon friend and other member of the conservative shadow defence team bring up the question of reopen this lawfare against our veteran government ministers say we will be sure to give veteran maximum support to that imply not protect they from the lawfare but support they as they go through the process but the process be the punishment everybody know that people involve in fatal incident would serve only limited prison term if heaven forbid they be convict but the probability be that they will not be convict the punishment lie in what they have to go through before they be acquit my right hon friend chair the select committee on which serve some year ago when it produce very good report on this issue so he be an expert on this all will say be that when it come to legacy issue labour often provide legal support but not necessarily always to veteran if the minister wish to maintain morale in the armed force past and present this order be clearly necessary for do that perhaps he will take this opportunity to clarify the government position do they still intend to table remedial order or to move straight to what the labour manifesto describe as new legislation in the field of legacy matter which be it seek clarification and support from shadow front benchers on this do they recognise that there may be bit of disagreement in the government between ministers in the ministry of defence and those in the northern ireland office on how to proceed certainly hope there be very much hope that mod ministers be fight tenaciously in private even if they can not say so in public to have this mad order scrap and to defend the northern ireland veteran just as the northern ireland veteran defend all of we the minister understand exactly what mean by that and think that he and some of his ministerial colleague may have be work on this if they have then we in good faith wish they godspeed have one more question on this matter and then will move on if it be the government intention to still go ahead with the remedial order again the house would really welcome clarity on this despite the fact that it would have disastrous consequence for recruitment and retention which the minister mention few minute ago can he confirm exactly what the government policy be be it to go down the remedial order route or down the route of introduce new primary legislation and if it be the latter what be the timing for that new bill fourthly and finally the minister for the armed forces have sign formal statement to the effect that in his view the provision of the armed forces act continuation order be compatible with the european convention on human right however there be question be british troop to be deploy to ukraine as part of some coalition of the willing perhaps follow ceasefire in ukraine what would happen to those british troop if they be to be involve in combat with russian force or russian acolyte what guarantee could the ministry give that if soldier fire their weapon in anger they would not subsequently be subject to lawfare under the human rights act even decade after the event as be the case in northern ireland this be not an idle point understand that the issue of lawfare and its effect on recruitment and retention in the british army have be raise at the most senior level in the army include in recent meeting with the chief of the general staff this be very much live issue that deserve to be raise in parliament not least for the soldier who might have to take these action for real give all this would it not be helpful as suggest number of time by my hon friend the member for south suffolk james cartlidge the shadow defence secretary for the minister to issue formal declaration that we would derogate from the european convention on human right in relation to any british military operation relate to ukraine so that soldier who serve in that conflict would be exclude from any lawfare prosecution even decade later the minister will know that the issue be materially affect morale in the armed force and especially in the special force community so any reassurance he can give regard derogation would no doubt be gratefully receive to summarise we obviously support this order to continue the operation of the armed forces act until december it would be helpful to have some idea of timing and even of the content of the prospective armed forces act as it be likely to be to allow interested party to plan to maintain morale and discipline in our armed force perhaps the minister could also confirm whether the government would countenance derogation from the echr during future military operation potentially include those in defence of ukraine moreover perhaps he could update the house on where we be on the government propose new legislation on legacy matter and on the fate of the propose remedial order under the human rights act be the government contemplating remove clause from that remedial order or be they abandon it altogether and instead rely on new primary legislation to achieve their aim the father of the house my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh give we all very wise advice we should increase defence spending we certainly should in this increasingly dangerous world we can argue about by how much and how quickly we conservative members want to work constructively with the government and the ministry of defence for the defence of the realm but do unto other as you would have they do unto you can now announce the result of today defer divisions on the draft enterprise act mergers involving newspaper enterprises and foreign powers regulations the ayes be and the noes be so the ayes have it on the draft criminal justice act suitability for fixed term recall order the ayes be and the noes be so the ayes have it the division list be publish at the end of today debate thank the minister for his statement appreciate he bring the debate to the floor of the house it show the importance of the issue and the importance that the government place on our armed force and in particular our armed force personnel welcome the pay rise that this government be give our service personnel and the commitment that the minister have make personally to tackle recruitment and retention issue as well as of course the billion increase in spending as be unable to intervene on the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois must say that be disappointed that this have turn into party political debate but assure everyone in the house after say that that do not intend to say any more on that matter this order reflect constitutional requirement but it also give we an annual opportunity to thank our brave servicemen and woman as have mention previously in this house be the son and like most people my age the grandson of veteran so recognise the sacrifice that our armed force family make for this country if the continuation order be not agree command officer and court martial will no long have the power to punish or discipline service people so it be obviously really important that we pass it today we should recognise that for the vast majority of our servicemen and woman the part of the act cover by the order be irrelevant however we must support our servicemen and woman as they support we which be why welcome the work of ministers and veteran on op valour as lord coaker say in the other place we inhabit world that be more dangerous than at any time since the fall of the soviet union in report house of lords october vol that be something that everybody in this house can reflect on like many member from all party attend the turning of the page ceremony organise by the speaker office and the serjeant at arm every week hear the name of member of this house and child of member of this house who lose their life in the second world war and find it incredibly move this morning it be particularly move when one name be read out it be the name of son of member of the house who pass away at the age of eight of course our service personnel and our country can not work in isolation and it be incredibly important to recognise the work that our armed force do in collaboration with our nato ally finally would like to take this opportunity to thank all hon and gallant members of this house know that one of they the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty be about to speak and be glad that he have return to his place for what they have do in their past career to keep we all safe also pay tribute to the servicemen and woman of my constituency of harlow and the uk as whole for their continuous service keep we and our family safe during these increasingly troubled time call the liberal democrat spokesperson today motion may appear procedural but it sit at the heart of how we govern our armed force and by extension how we uphold parliamentary democracy and the rule of law under the bill of rights of stand army in peacetime must be consent to annually by parliament that annual renewal be not just constitutional housekeeping it be clear democratic statement that power in this country derive from parliament and that our armed force serve under the law not above it will of course support the continuation order the armed forces act provide unified legal framework that enable our military to function without it the service justice system would fall away discipline could not be enforce and command officer would be strip of lawful authority and there would be no mean to uphold the standard of service that we rightly expect with that annual consent must come annual scrutiny we owe it to those who serve under this act to ensure that the political leadership they serve be worthy of their trust the reality be that over recent year conservative government have fail in their duty to our armed force while brutal war rag in europe the previous government be cut troop from our army our armed force be now small than they have be for generation at time when global threat be escalate equipment programme be routinely over budget and behind schedule the national audit office have repeatedly warn about capability gap in area such as battlefield communication armoured vehicle and naval readiness and our service personnel be too often ask to do more with less and that include live in unacceptable condition with housing system that do not meet their need the effectiveness of our armed force depend not just on kit but on people when these people be be let down when we ask they to serve under legal framework renew by this house but do not support they properly in practice we be not keep our side of the bargain the liberal democrats be call for different path we demand the reversal of those short sighted troop cut and long term plan to increase regular troop number to over once more that begin with immediate action through new joining and re enlistment bonus scheme to help recruit and retain at least personnel stabilise the force while we plan for future growth we be also call for cross party talk to agree sustainable path to meet nato new spending target of of gdp goal that should be above party politic the security of our country and our ally depend on serious sustained commitment beyond strategy and number we want to deliver fair deal for those who serve that mean proper pay and decent condition it mean high quality housing that meet the decent home standard as minimum it mean give real support for the transition to civilian life through access to mental health care job opportunity and practical assistance for family who so often bear the strain behind the scene we press the government to deliver long overdue justice for lgbt veteran many of whom be still await compensation after year of discrimination and dismissal that process must be fair fast and comprehensive we also demand full implementation of the atherton report recommendation to tackle the entrenched issue of harassment and misogyny face by too many woman in uniform service should never come with condition of fear or inequality look ahead we understand the new armed force act be expect to be introduce in the next year when the bill be bring forward will hold the government to high standard it must not be copy and paste exercise it must be an opportunity to improve the culture of our armed force by ensure that equality accountability and modernisation be at its heart the continuation order maintain the legal foundation of our armed force but law alone be not enough we need leadership we need commitment and we need government who do not simply consent to the military existence once year but honour their service every single day with action investment and respect welcome the armed forces act continuation order and place on record my wholehearte support for our armed force and the role they play in provide national security and defence of this nation both at home and deploy on operation across the globe as new mp last year the first delegated legislation committee sit on consider the previous continuation order be very proud to be able to do that as veteran and now the mp for constituency in huntingdon with british us and wide nato force know first hand how vital political support for our military be today although we have move past the period of kinetic operation that typify my generation of warfare in iraq and afghanistan the world feel more dangerous today than it do at that time the russian invasion of ukraine in precipitate sea change in the nature of warfare the manoeuvre warfare of old that we see during the initial invasion unchanged in generation and familiar to those of my generation and several before that have be replace by cyber drone grey zone and subthreshold activity that feel like warfare but not so long ago would have be the preserve of science fiction or an episode of black mirror that be the thread that must run through the strategic defence review and it be in such area that we must ensure our armed force be equip to compete in across domain do not doubt the government sentiment in wish to increase defence spending to ensure that we remain credible and capable nato ally and that we continue to punch above our weight on the world stage as an island nation in notionally geographically safe part of the world the legacy of our imperial past be one of world policing post colonial responsibility and expeditionary warfare our decentralised persistent nuclear capability ensure that we be nation that continue to be take seriously but my concern be that we be in danger of be bench as those nato ally close to the fray who feel the threat from russia on the eastern flank and the high north most keenly will with their vastly increase defence budget and whole of society approach to defence make we second tier nation the pledge to uplift defence spending to with the claim that we will achieve by april be simply not credible this smoke and mirror approach reflect the fact that the sum do not add up we see only yesterday that the government botch welfare reform have leave billion gap in the spending plan which be couple with furth billion from the winter fuel turn where will that money come from spending cut or high taxis be now inevitable and growth projection look at well sluggish meanwhile the government claim that they can reach on defence plus security but they refuse to break down the quantum of that spending how much of that be actually on hard defence and how much be on the intelligence service by our estimate the number be somewhere in the region of which suggest that the real defence budget as proportion of gdp be only if we bear in mind that sizeable proportion of that figure be solely our continuous at sea deterrent the figure for our conventional force drop to somewhere in the region of long way from the number that the government be put forward the figure that the government be now puff their chest out about include on national security and general resilience this contain everything from uk art spending to rural broadband under the chapter on pursue asymmetric advantage paragraph detail that the royal research ship sir david attenborough play part regard understand environmental change in the arctic ocean which mean that boaty mcboatface be include in the prime minister defence spending figure do we honestly think that russia and china will take that seriously the huge capability commitment that we see in the sdr and in the forthcoming equipment plan far outstrip our spending power we be quite literally write cheque that we may never be able to cash not only have we pledge to create an entirely new domain in cyber but we be about to embark on an essential modernisation process which now simply do not look fund the global combat air programme project not due to be deliver until the back end of the next decade but one that run the risk of be outpace by technological change be exquisitely capable but in year time will sixth generation fighter need to be crew it may be crew in but gcap out of service date be likely to be beyond do we honestly believe that crew aircraft will be relevant by then furthermore how will we deliver the loyal wingman in the system of system that it form part of drone be clearly the future of warfare and although we continue to use ukraine as the proving ground for new capability against near peer adversary the british army should be on the front foot rapidly equip and training with drone rather than use sport as the only drone warfare training of note see the minister take note while he be write stuff down let suggest that two stage warhead la javelin on an fpv first person view drone be surely the next generation anti armour capability that we need thus consign enfilade fire from defilade position to thing of the past despite my own anti tank root meanwhile project grayburn mean that we will replace rifle by significant logistical commitment in term not just of change the weapon system but of possibly change the nature of the ammunition as well although that will increase stop power it will also remove the purpose of which be sure we do not need to go into in the chamber today and everything that go with that include rifle rack ammunition pouch magazine and mag charger this be the nitty gritty of change weapon platform that really do take its toll on exactly how we would implement that we also intend to replace nearly land rovers by which be another significant logistical commitment in term of train soldier to drive they put those vehicle out and make sure that we have the logistical trail in place to be able to service those vehicle these small but still resource intensive task place more and more strain on our personnel only today understand that the ministry of defence police have cut role with the military provost guard service under resource and unable to replace they the burden have fall on regular soldier to augment their guard task such additional task with weekend guard erode goodwill and continue to contribute to retention problem only few week ago be in poland visit the raf conduct the nato air policing role interdict russian penetration along nato border the personnel there be rightly extremely proud to serve but at the same time the strain that the current operational tempo be place on those in specialist role be immense require they repeatedly to spend long period away from home incredibly the additional penalty that they pay be financial one with all but those on the high lsa band find that the pay they receive for be separate from their family be often at good negligible and at worst financial hit second order effect mean that an individual who may be be pay more to be on operation be not physically at home to help with the task there that mean have to pay for babysitter rather than have their spouse look after the child they have to pay for dog walker rather than be able to leave the dog at home for when the spouse return those cost add up and they simply be not factor into those extra payment that people receive for be on tour meanwhile we continue to see those who have already serve their nation question whether they continue to enjoy the support of those they have risk their life to serve the concern around the treatment of northern ireland veteran leave operation banner veteran rightly very concerned about their future and about be hold accountable for action from over year ago without clarity on whether protection will be guarantee for those who serve their country future recruitment could suffer hugely people serve their country will lose confidence under this government that they will not one day be treat as criminal it raise question over my own service and that of my peer the goalpost could one day move for we and know that that apply to former service people on both side of the house see the security minister on the front bench who serve so proudly in afghanistan welcome the armed forces act continuation order and be proud to play my small part in the history of one of our fine institution recognise and acknowledge the sentiment and intent of defence ministers to deliver for our service personnel do not call that into question for one second however wish to place on record my concern that the limitation place on they by treasury accounting and the smoke and mirror approach to hit our nato pledge will put the cross party consensus on defence at risk and the fiscal rule and botched legislation will reduce the chancellor spending power in dangerous new world this government must demonstrate their front footed commitment with tangible result not just pledge want to contribute as the mp for lagan valley which be the home of army hq in northern ireland too be proud of my family member who serve in the regular army the ulster defence regiment and the royal ulster constabulary however will depart from the view of some member would say that they be professional in everything that they do and they would agree with as would many across the house and indeed in northern ireland that they serve not above the law but within the law as any professional soldier will do pay tribute to the royal british legion lisburn and dromore branch and in particular to brian sloan from lisburn royal british legion which have be incredible in support veteran not just throughout lagan valley but across northern ireland make sure that they be at the fore of both civic and remembrance event echo the remark make by the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois on the opposition front bench about the cadet whom people often overlook in lagan valley we be bless to have sea raf and army cadet and every time look at those young people it make my heart feel proud and wee bit more confident for the future we be in change security situation as think everybody in the house know and one of the challenge that the minister refer to in his opening remark be that of recruitment and retention we must change the dial whenever we discuss these thing because this should be an opportunity for our young people often hear young people malign and marginalise but sometimes those young people desperately want to find meaning in life and want to find that through service that be exactly what the cadet provide and they will be our engineer and strategic op planner of the future put on record my thank to those who be serve to gallant member throughout the house and to people who have serve in lagan valley have their back in all of this completely and utterly be proud of they and of what they have do lastly have word for their family too because there be often hidden shift that people do not see and hidden threat that many will still be deal with year from now it be vital that we remember those people who have serve rise to raise an important point that have be report in the medium over the last hour about the future of the royal marines as former royal marine and the member of parliament who represent the commando training centre in lympstone think this be an issue that we need to discuss now hope that the minister will be able to give some answer it have be report that the royal marines be move away from their conventional amphibious operation and that large scale beach landing and traditional force protection from sea be be replace with small flexible team design to operate alongside special force let be clear adaptability be vital and be sure that there be many merit in the direction of travel but it be important that the minister tell the house about this and give we the opportunity to discuss it worry that abandon hard win capability without clear and credible replacement be not adaptation it be risk would like to put some question to the minister be the government remove the united kingdom amphibious warfare capability if so what replace it what be the long term plan to project force from sea to land if not through the royal marines in their traditional role we have no delivery date for the multi role strike ship that be mean to underpin the new commando force concept there be also no detailed plan and no answer on whether they will provide genuine operational flexibility or simply be scale back presence will the mrs be able to deploy full commando unit at scale in high threat environment or be they design purely for small team operation if it be the latter be that now the full extent of our national amphibious ambition that bring we to special force support which know be not an issue that we can discuss in the chamber with the security minister who serve with the special force support group in great detail however it have be report that commando have be task to operate alongside the special boat service in sensitive national mission include evacuation and hostage rescue what do that mean for the royal marines contribution to the special force support group be the sfsg be restructure or reassign that speak to deep point regard our nato ally we talk in the strategic defence review about be nato first nato have long count on the uk high end amphibious expertise it matter to our national resilience in world where rapid deployment from the sea be often the only option above all it matter to the man and woman who serve and they deserve clarity about their future role mission and identity therefore urge the minister to come forward with honest detailed answer not slogan or spin but clarity on capability posture and intent because defence policy can not be make in stealth for the final contribution call robin swann thank the minister for bring forward this order have just few question for he in regard to contribution make by other hon member many member have talk about the value of our cadet service in promote young people the value that they provide and the additional skill training that be give it be concern when meet some cadet in northern ireland that their senior officer report that there be fall in the core financial support the core grant that they receive from the ministry of defence may have clarity from the minister under this order that if that be true he will take the opportunity to reverse it it be not large sum of money in relation to the ministry of defence overall spend or indeed in relation to the projection talk about today the cadet provide valuable service and the financial support that be give to they should recognise that on continue support the minister and have have and will continue to have many exchange on the investment not just in our service personnel but in the facility and the basis refer specifically to northern ireland the minister know about aldergrove and the facility that it can be for all our armed force as strategic location in our

important subject again for the avoidance of doubt we will loyally support the order which be sure the house will pass without the need for division we have have some very good speech include from my hon friend the member for huntingdon ben obese jecty he recall his time serve as an infantry platoon commander have that same honour although in my case it be as cold war reservist rather than as regular like he my hon friend the member for exmouth and exeter east david reed ask number of question about the future of the royal marines now that the government have flog off most of our amphibious shipping he ask for confirmation about timing on the mrss class and about what happen to the royal marines now in their amphibious role perhaps the minister will provide the house with some reassurance if it be true that the royal marines will lose their amphibious role at least in the short term will he say whether the parachute regiment be consult on that decision interruption see that hansard must record that the security minister be chuckle at this point see the security minister chuckle away too would like confirmation that as part of the big three the raf regiment be also consult on this decision think the raf regiment have have other thing on its mind lately congratulate the hon member for south antrim robin swann on raise the important issue of northern ireland that take to the point on which would like to conclude hope that the minister will answer some of my question about what will happen to our northern ireland veteran again for the avoidance of doubt think know where his heart lie on this can not recall whether the security minister serve in northern ireland indicate assent he be nod know that he serve with great distinction in afghanistan so he too will understand this we on these benches have to believe that in the privacy of discussion between government departments they be do the right thing perhaps the minister can give some assurance to those of the veteran who serve in op banner who be still with we that the government will remove the sword of damocles that hang over they and allow those people who serve our country so bravely and with such distinction in incredibly difficult circumstance to sleep safely in their bed as they deserve thank all member for their contribution to this debate it be good one and will refer briefly to number of the issue that have be raise first detect strong support for our armed force on all side of the house which be good to see so hope there will not be division this debate have show the merit in hold the annual order on the floor of the house but suspect will need to have word with the leader of the house and the whip before commit to any future such debate because that be definitely outside my swim lane thank the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood for talk about cadet it be absolutely right that we invest more in cadet and that be why the strategic defence review set out our ambition to increase the size of our cadet force by this be strong investment in the future of our young people that provide opportunity to get lifelong skill and increase confidence as well as pathway for young people to serve in our armed force in order to fully realise the benefit have see the cadet on parade on plymouth hoe for armed forces day at the weekend know that there be strong support for they in every part of the country the hon lady talk about young people find meaning through service and could not agree more be grateful to she for that contribution the shadow minister the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois ask number of question we have to renew the armed forces act every five year and it will be renew in the proper way we be look at what be necessary to update that legislation especially as it will come in after the publication of the strategic defence review he will be familiar with the fact that the strategic defence review make the case for defence readiness bill and we be look at all those detail can reassure he that it be part of the commitment we have make that follow the wide consultation we undertake for the armed forces commissioner bill we will continue that in that spirit for future legislation the right hon gentleman may have miss it but just before prime minister question today we have northern ireland question and believe the northern ireland secretary reply to question on number of issue that he have ask about refer he to those remark because as he will know if only because say this every time he ask question on it that these be matter for the northern ireland office although defence clearly have strong equity and view on these matter as well be watch northern ireland question and from memory the northern ireland secretary say that the government would address this through primary legislation but he give no indication of any kind as to what will happen to the outstanding remedial order if ministers can not answer that today perhaps the minister or the northern ireland office could write to we and tell we where we stand the right hon gentleman will know because have have similar conversation in variety of different format over recent week that the policy intention of the northern ireland office be to repeal and importantly replace the unlawful northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act it have be find to be unlawful it do not enjoy community support and it need to be repeal and replace any government who be elect last july would have have to do that on the point about not enjoy community support when we be have these debate in great detail the highly divide community would always stand up and say how this be unacceptable and that be unacceptable and then their representative would quietly come up to we and say for goodness sake go on do what you be do the minister may have some legal problem to overcome but let he not be fool by what be say in public about what really need to be do thank the right hon member for his contribution indeed it be matter that my colleague in the northern ireland office follow closely as that be the lead department with responsibility for the repealing and replace of the legacy act be certain that he will continue make suggestion in that way it be not for to make announcement on the northern ireland office behalf but be certain that it will have listen to what he have to say be grateful for the remark from the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty tell he just before this that look forward to see he on the front bench in shadow defence role very soon as he know be big fan of what he have to say and like the way he bring his military expertise and certain defence nerdery which as defence nerd on the labour side very much appreciate politely say to the hon member that my experience from engage with our ally on nato eastern flank from finland and the baltic state all the way down pass belarus and other be that the nation there value the relationship with the united kingdom even more so over the past year we have strong relation with the joint expeditionary force nation of northern europe and we continue to deepen relation with our baltic friend include enhance our forward land force in estonia and our co operation and support for latvia and lithuania do not recognise that concern but he be right to raise it if only to allow to put on the record that we have strong support from those nation and indeed we strongly support they in want to be sovereign and free include from russian aggression also politely say to the hon member that rrs sir david attenborough provide an important presence in the antarctic region if he have not yet discover polar region nerdery can recommend that to he not only do hms protector our ice ship and rrs sir david attenborough provide an important presence for our arctic and antarctic mission they also help we honour our obligation under the antarctic treaty which be an important part of the rule base framework for the protection of the antarctic on the arctic and hms protector what plan do we have to procure an icebreaker to increase our footprint in that region know he be tempt to go into polar nerdery would be happy to speak to the hon member about some of those aspect clearly when it come to the provision of our ship and capability it be not just an mod matter it be one that we share in particular with our foreign commonwealth and development office colleague but be happy to pick up those point with he be not certain that the hon member be right on everything he say on drone but none the less he be certainly right that drone warfare have fundamentally change how warfare be conduct be proud that we have plan to return to spending on defence figure not meet since we do need to spend more on defence because we live in more dangerous time my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince be right to speak about the sacrifice that armed force family make it be something that we should not forget indeed that be the reason why in the armed forces commissioner bill we deliberately extend the power of the commissioner to have requirement to engage with the family member of our people who serve which be important be grateful to the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire for her contribution we do indeed have government who honour the service of our armed force every day and be proud to serve within it she be also right to raise lgbt veteran she will know that the prioritisation we have decide as ministers be that the initial payment as we stand up the system to make payment should be direct at those who be over or face terminal condition we have complete that work that be the right prioritisation in the first instance so justice can be do for those folk who may not see many more day we be now stand up that wide system so that we can process that wide set of payment that we have commit to do and we will continue to do so finally in relation to the question ask by the hon member for exmouth and exeter east david reed the future commando force strategy publish under the last government move away from full commando assault to small raid party that be the extant policy of the last government and because of that would be happy to speak to he about it we have strong commitment to the amphibious role of the royal marines and to the multi role strike ship as set out in the strategic defence review and would be very happy to speak to he about that far have royal marine base in my constituency as he have in his on that point will the minister give way be afraid have to conclude because of time but would be very happy to meet the hon gentleman to discuss this far can reassure he that the royal marines have very bright and strong future in our armed force on that point will the minister give way oh go on then what the minister say raise more fundamental question just like the release of the strategic defence review to trade body and to the press before its publication we be read about issue in the press but do not have the opportunity to discuss they in parliament while welcome the minister offer to have conversation with he why can we not have that conversation in the chamber now refer the hon gentleman to all the debate that call on the future of the royal marines under the last government when be sit on the opposition benches to make the case that the royal marines have bright future we have strong commitment to the future of the royal marines and to amphibiocity he will know the change that his government introduce in the future commando force strategy if we look at the lesson from ukraine the royal marines be well ahead of the learning that we now see from there be happy to discuss that with he far and be sure that he will want to table westminster hall debate so that we can discuss this even more reassure the hon gentleman and the house that the future of the royal marines be safe and secure we have strong commitment to amphibiocity we need to ensure that all our fight force adapt to the change environment in which they operate as someone who represent stonehouse barracks the spiritual home of the royal marines feel personally about that commitment and do not recognise the concern that he raise however be glad that there be strong cross party support for our armed force and for this draft order question put and agree to resolve that the draft armed forces act continuation order which be lay before this house on june be approve prevention and suppression of terrorism beg to move that the draft terrorism act proscribed organisations amendment order which be lay before this house on june be approve be grateful to the house for its consideration of this draft order which will see three distinct group proscribe maniacs murder cult palestine action and the russian imperial movement on that point will the minister give way will the minister give way will make bit of progress which do not think be unreasonable the proscription of those three organisation will reaffirm the uk zero tolerance approach to terrorism regardless of its form or underlie ideology it may be helpful to set out some background to the proscription power to proscribe an organisation the home secretary must reasonably believe that it be concern in terrorism that mean that the organisation commit or participate in terrorism it prepare for terrorism it promote or encourage terrorism or it be otherwise concerned in terrorism some terrorist organisation be currently proscribe under the terrorism act proscription be rightly ideologically neutral it judge an organisation on its action and the action it be willing to deploy in pursuit of its cause the uk definition of terrorism be establish in law quarter of century ago and it have stand the test of time and extensive scrutiny since on that point will the minister give way will make little more progress before give way the definition have three limb first the use or threat of action must reach certain level of seriousness such as serious violence or serious damage to property secondly the use or threat must be design to influence government or intimidate the public or section of the public thirdly the use or threat must be make for the purpose of advance political religious racial or ideological cause successive independent reviewer of terrorism legislation have uphold the uk terrorism definition as effective and fit for purpose even as the threat from terrorism have evolve rise will give way in just moment proscription be one of the most powerful counter terrorism tool available to government any decision to proscribe be take with great care and follow rigorous consideration as note by jonathan hall kc in his report on the operation of the terrorism act of rise will give way to the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn be grateful to the minister the question that many of we want to put to he be this why have he link these three organisation together he clearly have make judgment on each of the three organisation independently of each other and many other outside be sure think it would be fair if we take individual vote on the three many of we be very concerned about the issue face palestine action and that be the issue we wish to address in the debate can say to the right hon gentleman that will move on to that and will explain with real clarity precisely why we have proceed in the way that we have suspect that he have long memory be sure that he will recall that he have vote against proscribe number of organisation previously include al qaeda in when the motion be bundle along with other militant organisation so there be clear precedent for do this the reason we seek to do it be to demonstrate that we do not attach any kind of ideological prism with which to seek to make judgment the home secretary will take view base on legal threshold and that be the basis on which we have proceed thank the minister for bring forward this motion if it come to vote as some have indicate they wish it to do my party will support the government come from northern ireland and we understand what it mean to have security it be important to have government ministers the police the army and and they all have responsibility in relation to the membership of those organisation be there list of those who may be member of palestine action for instance do not know where they be there might be some in this house if there be perhaps we would understand will they be subject to the ruling and proscription as well know that the hon gentleman speak with great authority on these matter bear out of his extensive experience of deal with these matter in northern ireland if he be little patient and if the house allow to make bit of progress will explain and respond to the point he have raise and the point that other hon member seek to raise if the house will allow let turn to the specific measure before we today take each of the propose addition to the list of proscribe organisation in order first there be the maniacs murder cult also know as mmc which be an insidious white supremacist and neo nazi organisation operate online and across border it aim to encourage individual to engage in act of violence against people it perceive to be antisocial include homeless people drug addict and migrant all to further its own ideology and degrade human society through violence the government assess that mmc commit prepare for promote and encourage act of terrorism mmc member and leader have claim number of violent attack globally that be commit in pursuit of the group aim mmc supply instructional material that could increase the capability or motivation of an aspire attacker include guide that provide information on how to fatally attack someone with knife and use vehicle as weapon mmc member and non member share its material and other online content include video of violent attack to encourage further violence in support of its ideology on may year old georgian national know as commander butcher consider to be one of mmc leader be extradite to the united states and he be set to stand trial in new york for solicit hate crime and act of mass violence as set out in the indictment he be allege to have recruit individual online to promote mmc ideology by commit act of murder arson bombing and mass poisoning in new york act target at member of ethnic minority group homeless people and jewish schoolchildren as this case illustrate mmc have truly transnational audience which include people in the uk it do not matter where the leader of this network be base if they be capable of inspire act of violence and terror in any country vulnerable individual such as minor be particularly expose to the horrific material mmc publish and distribute online this government will not stand by and allow the terrorist threat and wide societal harm cause by mmc to persist proscribe mmc be key to deter and divert individual from engage with its violent content and it send clear signal to social medium company to remove mmc material from their platform the threat pose by mmc must be take extremely seriously whether it be inspiring act of violence against our people or influence young people to commit those act we will not hesitate to take action against such group to keep our country safe agree with the minister that mmc clearly meet the threshold for proscription but when do its action first come to the attention of the government why have they leave it so long to bring forward this order why do they leave it until it be politically convenient be sorry that the hon gentleman have choose to make that final point there be no political convenience in what we be seek to do today we be seek to ensure the security of our country and if he have little patience will far make that case to he and to the house let turn to palestine action the public attention it have garner should not be confuse with legitimacy nor should group form five year ago be conflate with the legitimate campaign for palestinian right and statehood which have exist in our country and in this house for more than five decade let be clear the proscription of palestine action be not aim at ban protest that support palestine there be many way in which people can continue to lawfully express their support for palestine without be member or supporter of palestine action the minister will be aware that the high court have grant palestine action permission for legal challenge rather than the home secretary who be not here rush this order through parliament should it not be delay until the judicial process have conclude we be certainly not seek to rush this through parliament these be matter that the home secretary and have consider for some time there be clear route to legal challenge and if an organisation be proscribe it have the opportunity to pursue that route that be entirely within the right of any organisation that be proscribe and be matter for they let make the important point that freedom of expression and assembly be cornerstone of our democracy they be fundamental right and this government will always respect and protect they we will always defend the right of the british people to engage in legitimate and peaceful protest and to stand up for the cause in which they believe often show visitor the statue of viscount falkland and its missing spur remove when suffragette chain herself to it be here when protester superglue their buttock to the glass panel above we cause some scandal and damage will the minister confirm that criminal damage no matter how creatively or indeed scandalously undertake will always be deal with under criminal law and not as terrorist act know that my hon friend have give this matter serious consideration and she make an interesting point in my remark will seek to evidence to she and other why we have choose to take this course of action on this group hope that when have make my speech she will understand why we be proceed in this way be just make point about the importance of the right to protest essential as such right be they do not give this group carte blanche to seriously damage property or subject member of the public to fear and violence the minister will be aware that many of we in this chamber think that palestine action be in different category from the other two organisation that he be seek to proscribe be he aware that several un special rapporteur include those protect human right say that they have tell the uk government that act of protest that damage property but be not intend to kill or injure people should not be treat as terrorism be grateful to the mother of the house because she make an important point before respond to it let say politely and gently to she and other that my strong sense be that if the action of the group that we be consider have be conduct by an organisation with different ideological motif she and some of her colleague would strongly recommend that the government proscribe they interruption that is be afraid the conclusion have arrive at my right hon friend mention the united nations the government receive letter from the un special procedure mandate holder at the end of and the uk government provide full response which have be publish gently say to she that national security and keep the public safe be very much matter for this country not other organisation this heavy handed approach threaten basic freedom and set dangerous precedent for all political dissent in the uk do the minister acknowledge that do not acknowledge that and do not accept the hon gentleman characterisation of the decision we have take if he will listen to what have to say hope he will understand why we be progress in this way the attack at brize norton on june have understandably provoke shock and anger in this house and across the country but it be just the late episode in palestine action long history of harmful activity it have orchestrate nationwide campaign of attack that have result in serious damage to property and cross the threshold between direct criminal action and terrorism hope that go some way to respond to the point that my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne central and west dame chi onwurah make palestine action member have use violence against people respond at the scene of attack for their role in co ordinate attack member of the organisation have be charge with serious offence include violent disorder grievous bodily harm with intent and aggravate burglary which be an offence involve weapon thank the minister for give way and for some of the thing that he have say everything he have speak about could be deal with under criminal law my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne central and west dame chi onwurah mention the suffragette think we need to give the context of little bit of history the suffragette carry out campaign of window smashing poster and paint defacement cut telegraph and railway line and target bombing and arson but specifically avoid harm people there be long history in this country of direct action that push the boundary of our democracy it be very difficult for all of we but this be still direct action not terrorist action acknowledge my hon friend point about history and it be entirely reasonable context for he and other to raise but ultimately this government must respond to event take place in the here and now the government have to make sometimes difficult decision about what measure be require to keep the public safe he be absolutely within his right to make comparison with other group but as will explain fundamentally the home secretary have to take view on whether legal threshold have be cross and if it have she have to make judgment on whether she wish to proceed will the minister give way must make bit of progress because still have some way to go despite some of its rhetoric the group own material state that it be not non violent and that be echo in the action of its member who have commit atrocious attack have carefully consider all the evidence the home secretary have conclude that palestine action be concern in terrorism and should be proscribe the house will understand that be unable to comment on specific intelligence or to go into detail about incident that be sub judice however can provide summary of the group activity and it be right that make the position clear to the house since its inception in palestine action have orchestrate and enact campaign of direct criminal action against business and institution include key national infrastructure and defence firm that provide service and supply that support ukraine nato our five eyes ally and the uk defence industry over time and most notably since the start of palestine action activity have increase in frequency and severity its target have broaden to include financial firm charity university and government building its method have become more aggressive with its member demonstrate willingness to use violence will the minister give way will but must then make some progress the minister have speak about some of the history of this but there be more recent history the last government introduce the public order act to deal with extinction rebellion the home secretary who be then on the opposition front bench list all the various crime that could be deal with she say then the government be extend power that we would normally make available just for serious violence and terrorism to peaceful protest police officer themselves have say that this be severe restriction on person right to protest and in reality be unworkable official report may vol she be right then and be wrong today be she not will make bit of progress because hope to answer some of the point that the right hon be about to explain to he that specific recent incident have inform the decision understand why he may not want to listen to that but invite he to do so because the context be very important will the minister give way no will make some progress now palestine action own material state we be not non violent and we have specific target the group have footprint in all police region in the uk and have pledge to escalate its campaign this disgraceful pattern of activity can not be allow to continue in apply the legislative framework the government assess that palestine action commit act of terrorism in several attack will the minister give way will not give way because need to get these important point on the record palestine action have commit act of serious damage to property with the aim of progress its political cause and intimidate and influence the public and the government these include attack against thales in glasgow in and against instro precision in kent and elbit systems uk in bristol last year in such attack palestine action member have force entry on to premise while arm with variety of weapon and damage or demolish property cause million of pound worth of criminal damage as the house have hear palestine action member have use violence against people respond at the scene during palestine action attack against the thales defence factory in glasgow in the group cause over million worth of damage include to part that be essential for our submarine palestine action cause panic among staff who fear for their safety as pyrotechnic and smoke bomb be throw into the area to which they be evacuate when pass custodial sentence for the perpetrator the sheriff say throw pyrotechnic at area where people be be evacuate to can not be describe as non violent the government also assess that palestine action prepare for terrorism the organisation have provide practical advice to assist its member in carry out significant level of property damage at target right across the uk for example palestine action have release an underground manual that encourage its member to create small group or cell and provide guidance about how to conduct activity against private company and government building it explain how to operate covertly to evade arrest and provide link to website also create by palestine action which contain map of target location across the uk the government assess that palestine action promote and encourage terrorism include through the glorification on social medium of its attack involve property damage palestine action attack be not victimless crime employee have experience physical violence intimidation and harassment and they have be prevent from enter their place of work we would not tolerate this activity from organisation motivate by islamist or extreme right wing ideology and we can not tolerate it from palestine action by implement this measure we will remove palestine action veil of legitimacy tackle its financial support and degrade its effort to recruit and radicalise people into commit terrorist activity in its name we must be under no illusion palestine action be not legitimate protest group people engage in lawful protest do not need weapon people engage in lawful protest do not throw smoke bomb and fire pyrotechnic around innocent member of the public and people engage in lawful protest do not cause million of pound worth of damage to national security infrastructure include submarine and defence equipment for nato proscribing palestine action will not impinge the right to protest people have always be able to protest lawfully or express support for palestine and they can continue to do so be conscious of the time so will briefly turn to the russian imperial movement rim be white supremacist ethno nationalist organisation that seek to create new russian imperial state the method that rim use to try to achieve those aim threaten uk euro atlantic and wide international security and prosperity rim conduct combat activity via its paramilitary unit the russian imperial legion and have actively fight alongside russian force and other pro russian right wing extremist group in the ongoing russia ukraine conflict in do so the government assess that it have commit or participate in act of terrorism rim also prepare for terrorism it manage paramilitary training programme know as partisan which increase the capability of attendee to conduct terrorist attack by proscribe rim the uk will reinforce our steadfast support for ukraine resistance to russian aggression and our commitment to counter future threat from extreme right wing terrorism in the uk and europe almost two year ago it be my task on behalf of what be then his majesty opposition to strongly support the action take to proscribe the wagner group an organisation that rightly stand condemn for its act of indiscriminate violence and terror in ukraine and elsewhere hope the whole house will be as united today as it be on that occasion in endorse the action take against the russian imperial movement to conclude the first duty of government be to keep our country safe when our collective security and our value be threaten we will not hesitate to act today proscription will send clear and unambiguous message that this parliament stand against terrorism however and wherever it manifest itself only in apply the uk counter terrorism framework without bias can we maintain confidence in it therefore urge member to support these proscription and commend the order to the house rise order member will have note from the order paper that this debate be only minute long it have to conclude at pm which mean back benchers will be on speak limit of four minute to begin with and that only few will get in before the debate have to conclude call the shadow minister be grateful to the minister for his speech and for bring this important and very necessary measure to the house also thank he for the briefing be provide with early today let we be clear what these measure be and be not about do we support free speech yes do we support the right to protest yes do we support freedom of expression yes however the very freedom that make our democracy what it be be exactly the freedom that the group we be consider be put at risk which be why this order be need the group we be discuss palestine action maniacs murder cult and the russian imperial movement have nothing whatsoever to do with legitimate protest they would not be face proscription if they be demonstrate peacefully respectfully or legally as so many group and organisation across the country do and must continue to be able to do freely these group have choose different path entirely and for that reason this action be rightly be take against they do the shadow minister agree with that if the only acceptable form of protest be polite protest that be not protest but permission the right to protest be hugely important part of our democracy we support the right to protest and the right to free speech we do not support right to commit criminal damage or to intimidate or threaten the public but that be exactly what these group be do and why they be quite rightly be proscribe we must be clear eyed about the broad threat landscape we face terrorism remain one of the most serious threat to our national security whether it come from international network those radicalise online or extremist group operate on our soil the threat be real and evolve and it must demand our constant vigilance our security service work tirelessly day and night to keep we safe they have disrupt countless plot that the public will never know about but we can not be complacent the nature of terrorism have change from sophisticated network to lone actor from physical attack to attack on cyber network and from foreign battlefield to our own community and our response must evolve accordingly we should reflect on what terrorism be as define by the terrorism act it occur when an action use or threat be design to influence the government or to intimidate the public or section of the public and the use or threat be make for the purpose of advance political religious racial or ideological cause the full list of action be detail in the act but they include serious violence against person those that endanger life or health and safety and those that seriously damage property proscription be not step take lightly but it be strong and necessary tool that the previous as well as the current government have use and should use to protect the public and to ensure that our police and security service have full access to the resource they need to keep the public our institution and our way of life safe no one could hear the minister description of the action of palestine action mmr and rim and consider they to be those of peaceful legitimate protest group do the shadow minister accept that there be distinction in intent between palestine action and the other two organisation there be no intention with palestine action to cause injury to people so matter can already be deal with in the criminal court thank the hon member for that but if palestine action be use pyrotechnic against people who be escape an attack by that organisation that be intent if it intend to damage royal air force property and ministry of defence property by sabotage raf jet at brize norton that be intent it be show intent as well as the other organisation these group do not share our value they do not respect our country they do not care about our way of life and they show no regard for the safety of our citizen on the conservative benches we be proud of the action take by previous conservative government to strengthen our counter terrorism framework we give our police and security service the power they need to confront evolving threat and we welcome and support the home secretary make use of the same power today as the minister say proscription be vital tool and strong deterrent but it be only part albeit very important part of what we need to do to keep our country safe on its own it be not enough it must be follow by enforcement we will of course be watch closely to ensure the police have the resource and the backing they need from the labour government to do just that as the minister and have say the first job of any government be to keep their citizen safe we as the official opposition will always support the government in that aim the activity of these organisation have clearly meet the threshold for proscription under the terrorism act and we on the opposition benches be very happy to support the government in their aim today want to speak specifically about palestine action it be most regrettable that the government have table one order ban three organisation when it know that there be political disagreement on palestine action that be no way to bring terror legislation to the house want to be clear and to put on the record that would be support the order today if it refer only to the organisation maniacs murder cult and the russian imperial movement lead legal and human right organisation amnesty international and liberty have condemn the proscription of palestine action liberty say target protest group with terrorism power be shocking escalation of the government crackdown on protest this move would be huge step change in how counter terror law be apply amnesty international uk say we deeply concerned at the use of counter terrorism power to target protest group they certainly should be use to ban they they both urge the home secretary to rethink before bring this to parliament yesterday several united nations special rapporteur include those for protect human right while counter terrorism and for promote freedom of expression say they have contact the uk government to say that act of protest that damage property but be not intend to kill or injure people should not be treat as terrorism likewise lord charlie falconer the former justice minister state that the sort of demonstration see at military base by palestine action would not justify proscription as terrorist organisation today we be not vote on whether people agree with palestine action tactic we be not vote on whether people think its aim be right or wrong we be vote on whether the action it have take against property not against people should lead to its being treat as terrorist organisation when what it have do can be prosecute as criminal damage there be long history of protest activity include act of trespass criminal damage sabotage and more indeed the home secretary recent statement repeatedly refer to criminal damage and the live court case show that there be already legal provision to deal with palestine action there be variety of potential consequence if the proscription of palestine action be pass support or join palestine action could carry up to year in prison that risk criminalise thousand of volunteer and supporter thousand have support or volunteer with palestine action include nurse student retiree and professional many have never engage in direct action but risk be criminalise today meet representative of amnesty international who offer number of frightening example of how our constituent could be place at risk of prosecution under section of the terrorism act and could face maximum sentence of year if palestine action be proscribe accord to amnesty international person who tweet oppose the war crime in gaza and think that palestine action have point could easily fall foul of this provision as could person who say to another do not support all the method use by palestine action but think protest be important and respect the personal sacrifice member of palestine action be willing to make risk arrest to challenge war crime or an individual with placard that read palestine action be peaceful it should be de proscribe this legislation could affect constituent who have never be member of palestine action and who have never and would never commit direct action speech or comment they make in community meeting could be trawl and they could end up face legal proceeding result in prison sentence of up to year that concern we all people out there view terrorism as mean heinous act such as shoot people blow people up assassinate people and other act of violence urge colleague to consider the consequence for their constituent of proscribe palestine action alongside these other group call the liberal democrat spokesperson be grateful to the minister for take the time to discuss this issue with as have be mention there be three organisation list today and the order before we be unamendable take each of the three organisation in turn the russian imperial movement be an ultranationalist and white supremacist militant organisation operate from inside russia the group have be proscribe by both the united states and canada and even the russian government have blacklist many of the group publication and activity the rationale and justification for proscription be clear and we be content to support it the maniacs murder cult be similarly destructive drive by belief that society must be violently destabilise so that new neo nazi or white supremacist order can rise from its ash it promote random act of violence include murder assault and bombing as deliberate tactic to instil fear and chaos the rationale and justification for proscription be clear and we be content to support it the question for many member today relate to palestine action on june as have be widely report in the press two member of palestine action gain unauthorised access to raf brize norton in oxfordshire the uk large airbase circumvent perimeter security under cover of darkness once inside they target two aircraft incident involve member of palestine action include attack at site operate by elbit systems in bristol in and again this year as well as at thales uk facility in glasgow in note the minister comment about case currently go through the court no matter how strongly any of we feel about the appalling humanitarian crisis in gaza and many of we across this house and across the country feel very strongly indeed that do not justify attack on military basis in britain those responsible must face the full force of the law there be no doubt about that however those law already exist and that be not what be in front of mps today the question we face be not whether or not these people have commit crime but whether someone who merely express support for they should face up to year in jail the bar for which group should be proscribe as terrorist organisation be rightly set very high it be crucial that the reason for these decision be transparent to maintain the public trust in our counter terrorism framework have listen carefully both to expert who have raise concern include those from the un who be mention by the mother of the house and to what the minister have say have also see the home secretary word about her reason for make this decision base on damage to property notwithstanding the minister comment on the use of violence proscribe an organisation solely on the ground of serious damage to property would believe be unprecedented to date would welcome the minister correct if have get this wrong no organisation have be proscribe in the uk exclusively for property damage as be the case here accord to the home secretary word on the government website while there may be compelling legal argument that the action of palestine action have meet the legal definition of terrorism in term of serious criminal damage the decision to proscribe be ultimately make at the home secretary discretion there be still question as to whether that discretion be proportionate in this case give the level of threat pose to the general public would welcome more detail from the minister on why he believe this be proportionate response as remain to be convince currently the maximum custodial term for certain offence relate to membership of or express support for proscribe terrorist organisation be year yet in instance such as this where action though criminal and damaging may not pose the same imminent threat to life blanket application of such severe penalty risk be disproportionate the home secretary rightly have substantial power to take action to keep our country safe but it be also right and entirely proper that we scrutinise the use of these power and press the government to ensure that any use of they be wholly proportionate twenty one year ago human right barrister stand in court and defend an activist who break into raf fairford try to disable bomber to prevent war crime in iraq that become landmark case in lawful non violent direct action against an illegal war that barrister be now our prime minister sir keir starmer kc he argue that it be not terrorism but conscience fast forward to june two palestine action activist enter raf brize norton and spray red paint red paint not fire on aircraft link to surveillance flight over gaza instead of prosecute they for criminal damage which be what normally be do the home secretary be use the terrorism act to proscribe palestine action as terrorist group this be an unprecedented and dangerous overreach of the state never before in britain have it be crime to simply support group this order lump non violent network of student nurse teacher firefighter and peace campaigner ordinary people my constituent and yours with neo nazi militia and mass casualty cult palestine action real crime be we have to be clear shut down elbit systems site that arm the israeli military its true offence be be audacious enough to expose the blood soak tie between this government and the genocidal israeli apartheid state and its war machine let we be clear to equate spray can of paint with suicide bomb be not just absurd it be grotesque it be deliberate distortion of the law to chill dissent criminalise solidarity and suppress the truth amnesty international liberty over senior lawyer and un special rapporteur have all oppose these draconian measure even at this late stage the order should be withdraw under this order anyone express moral support for proscribe group could face year in prison that include wear badge wear shirt share post or call for de proscription and journalist have no exemption either there be no legal protection for report favourably even factually about palestine action by this weekend million of people include many of our constituent could be place under these sweeping restriction let we not forget what be happen in gaza where the real crime be be ignore hospital bomb child starve and ten of thousand of people kill palestinian child now suffer more amputation per capita than child anywhere else on earth israel be on trial for genocide at the international court of justice and the israeli prime minister face an international criminal court arrest warrant yet the government response be to criminalise solidarity and to continue export lethal jet that be decimate gaza we also have to understand the history of this country and what build our democracy the tradition of civil disobedience that include the suffragette without whom would not have the vote let alone the privilege of be here as an mp even those who oppose palestine action tactic must recognise the vast gulf between criminal damage and terrorism if this order pass what and who be next climate protester strike worker feminist in the street already we have see wide crackdown on our civil liberty musician censor journalist arrest and demonstrator include mp sit here harass and now this government want to use anti terror law to make peaceful protest itself crime if our democratic institution function as they should none of this would be necessary to conclude if this proscription pass as it will we have to understand that no campaign will be safe tomorrow we have to recognise that this will go down as dark day in our country history and one that will be remember people will ask which side be you on and stand with the million of people who oppose genocide because be one of they oppose the blood soak hand of this government try to silence we so say this loudly and proudly on wednesday july order call sir iain duncan smith do have concern about the last of the three organisation cover by the order in relation to the application of the criminal law there might be another way of do it but support the government position however this debate have cast into light the fact that we have take no action to proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps give all the element that we be discuss today this question sit like the elephant in the room why be we not proscribe the irgc why have we resist do that that would have huge impact on terrorism or aspect of terrorism let we look at it carefully the irgc deliberately export the islamic revolution it use proxy and have be sponsor terrorism as have be demonstrate without dispute all over the world it support hamas and hezbollah and have supply they with huge amount of weapon on whichever side of the argument one sit the fact be that this terrible killing would not have happen have that not be the case the irgc be heavily involve in that it be sanction but not proscribe sanctioning do not give we enough power to deal with its proxy and those who work for it when in opposition the government campaign to proscribe the irgc remember quite happily work with various member who be then on the opposition front bench to do that the foreign office endlessly say that we would lose all possibility of form diplomatic relation or get through to iran but how be that go how have that go over the past year not at all well one can not reason with these character huge number of global attack be root in irgc money and training it have high level of activity in the uk such as propaganda to try to build arrangement here sometimes in plain view there be even link on facebook it could be trap but it do it openly because nothing can be do to it at all of course the irgc support hezbollah which be also proscribe if we keep follow this chain around and around we come back to the irgc that should be the subject of the debate today that should be the decision that should be consider on the floor of the house the irgc should be proscribe because it be at the root of all terrorism that exist here and in the middle east if we do not do that it prompt the question of what we be do here with these other three organisation let first associate myself with the very good comment of the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart agree with the proscription of the two far right fascist organisation think they should be proscribe but can we as house accept that there be those of we present who have different take on today proscription of palestine action we do not have to agree with the behaviour or action of palestine action to make the case today that this proscription be wrong ask hon member to acknowledge that the many of we here today who take different view on this issue be as much part of this democracy as those who agree with the proscription it be just that our take on the delicacy of our democracy on what this proscription do and on how it undermine our democracy happen to differ from that of other people there be opposition members who have repeatedly say that they understand and empathise with constituent who have smash and vandalise ultra low emission zone camera and low emission zone camera direct action be not just of the left everyone in our democracy can partake in it this be judgment call about how we well protect our democracy and an acknowledgment that not all threat be external or violent some threat be base on the decision that we take in this place sometimes we might take decision that fundamentally undermine our own democracy have no doubt that some of we will be call terrorist sympathiser by some who disagree with our position but that would be wrong look around the world and watch as democracy and the rule of law be systematically smash corporation and the wealthy have increase power and wealth to influence our democracy look over the atlantic at the united states our democracy be delicate our democracy be precious the decision we take in this place determine whether those democracy will survive into the future look around the world and around this country look at the authoritarian right party that be point ahead in the poll and worry about the future of our democracy this government our government have to make decision that take account of the possibility that we might not be in government one day it may be the authoritarian right who be in government and they will take this far fast and deep than we ever have so we should be put in fireguard now protect our democracy and this measure do not do that in conclusion understand what terrorism be be in london on july and watch my community this city attack by real terrorist at that point rightly or wrongly decide that be go to afghanistan to fight the terrorist go because love this country and love our democracy and want to see it protect today proscription order against palestine action undermine that and wish that my government be not do this as we have hear the issue around the proscription of palestine action have throw up number of legitimate concern there be no doubt that it will have an impact on our right to protest and on the civil liberty that we have enjoy for decade although it be absolutely right to condemn and prosecute criminal activity especially those that threaten our national security surely this must be do within the framework of exist legislation as it always have be this order look nothing other than direct response to palestine action be able to infiltrate an raf base and cause damage to defence aircraft the decision to proscribe an organisation be ultimately matter for the government and it be up to the home secretary to decide who go on that list it be base on intelligence that the government hold do not think that the minister have convince many of we today that this have meet the threshold for proscription and we need to hear more about their concern about this particular group before reach for that power the government must take into account whether it be proportionate justify and in the national interest to proscribe such an organisation terrorism legislation as we know hand extremely broad power to the state and as such it must always be treat with the high degree of caution and restraint we live in society where group and organisation have the democratic right to campaign and express their view on particular issue in democratic respectful and lawful manner it be important that the right to lawful protest be not affect by the home secretary decision today and it be extremely concern that this decision could lead to these power be extend to other campaigning organisation palestine action have inexplicably be link to group such as the maniacs murder cult and the russian imperial movement group unknown to the house until this measure be on the order paper today but they be group that from cursory glance at their activity should of course be proscribe for palestine action to be include alongside those group be at good cynical and calculated move by the government to ensure that this order get through today people all over the uk include many of my constituent rightly feel very strongly about the appalling crime that be be commit against innocent civilian in gaza on daily basis many of those people have be take part in weekly protest to make their voice hear and to show solidarity with the palestinian people these people be now concerned that they might be catch up in this proscription be also concerned that many young people who be share social medium post from palestine action could now be consider to have glorify what will soon be proscribe group we need clarity on what action would result in people be charge under this terrorism legislation for example could person wear palestine action badge hand out at demonstration or rally be charge with terrorism organisation such as amnesty international and even the united nations have express their concern about the uk broad definition of terrorism in this regard this week an israeli strike on gaza seafront café kill at least palestinians this be what we should be discuss today and every day until permanent ceasefire be reach and all the hostage be release the government must act in the national interest and keep we safe from all the challenge present to they but we need clear reassurance about the wide impact of what be propose welcome the home secretary decisive action on palestine action the maniacs murder cult and the russian imperial movement twenty month on from the horrific terror attack of october the suffering of innocent people in gaza in israel and beyond have rightly be the subject of much international campaigning money have be raise to support charity get aid into gaza the hostage and miss family forum have work tirelessly to keep the plight of the remain hostage on the world agenda and hundred of thousand of people have contact their mp sign petition and make their voice hear that be all genuine activism which be importantly within the bound of the law palestine action be different over five year it have conduct campaign of violence intimidation and criminal damage in one attack on business in bristol two police officer be attack with sledgehammer the officer find not only sledgehammer but whip axis and other home make weapon palestine action have attack business in my constituency intimidate the worker there last month at raf brize norton military plane be vandalise and million of damage be do such attack undermine our national security and our armed force they can never be justify applaud the home secretary for respond in the strong possible term palestine action also have track record of attack against the country jewish community in may building housing jewish own business in north manchester be vandalise with red paint and graffiti read happy nakba day later that month jewish own business in stamford hill be attack by the organisation with window break red paint graffiti and damage do to the building mezuzah in the latter case palestine action claim that the business be link to israeli defence company prove baseless this campaign of antisemitic harassment reveal the logical conclusion of its extremism the important difference between it and all the other group mention in the house be that it target specific ethnic and religious minority in our country this extremism do not help single palestinian smash window will not free palestine but it undermine the hard work of so many people who support the palestinian cause and be work towards peaceful future and it lead to an environment where british jews feel unsafe and harass that should never be tolerate legitimate protest be fundamental democratic freedom but palestinian action abandon legitimate action long time ago welcome the government swift action in ensure that that organisation can no long pose threat to our security to our business and to the jewish community as the debate open intervene on the minister and be grateful to he for give way just need an explanation hope that we will get one as to why group be always put together in these order and not deal with separately there be clearly different order of concern here want to speak solely about palestine action we live in democratic society and we have to understand where our right have come from the hon member for high peak jon pearce represent the place where in the mass trespass take place lead by benny rothman jewish activist in the communist party at that time who be demand right of access to the countryside he be roundly condemn by all the mass medium and the government of the day he be put on trial and he be put in prison he be eventually release from prison after mass protest in his support without benny rothman and those other that access to the countryside simply would not have happen at that time we can look at all the other people who over decade of our history have stand up for free speech and democracy we can go back to the chartists to the suffragette and to those who campaign to end apartheid in south africa interestingly during all the apartheid year while the british government do condemn the african national congress and do indeed believe for while that nelson mandela be terrorist they never ban the anc in britain because they be advise that it be important that there should be place where people could express that voice of hope for the end of apartheid the woman who go to greenham common to protest about the deployment of nuclear weapon there be never label as terrorist either yes they be charge with criminal trespass as many other have be indeed those who undertake direct action be well aware of the risk they take however it cross an enormous threshold to suddenly make such an announcement about palestine action which speak out against the horror of what be happen in gaza where hundred be mow down every day by the israel defence forces simply for queue for food when they be desperately hungry and their child be starve surely we should be look at the issue that palestine action be concern about as well as the supply of weapon from this country to israel which have make all that possible if the order go through today it will have chilling effect on protest quote letter send to the home secretary on june direct action be longstanding and respected part of british political history from the suffragette chain themselves to railing to strike miner to anti apartheid campaigner occupy institution and disrupt trade civil disobedience and direct action have always be necessary force for progress and justice will the right hon gentleman give way will not that letter come from bibi khan the chair of north london council of mosques and muhammad uddin from newham muslim forum on behalf of the london council of mosque that be concerned about the chilling effect that this piece of legislation if agree today will have on the right to protest as whole my last point hope the minister can reply to this if he get the chance be that legal action be be take there will be hearing in the high court this friday about judicial review of this case can it be make clear that the order will not be put into force until all legal avenue have be exhaust and that there will not be temporary imposition later to be withdraw if there be successful legal action we need to know that all democratic avenue have be fully explore in this process today push to proscribe palestine action non violent direct action group as terrorist organisation be disastrous turning point of historic proportion it risk undermine exist prosecution case against activity by palestine action activist and be legally dubious human and civil right organisation lawyer and un expert have all speak out against the misuse of terrorism law call the move unjustified and warn of chilling effect on protest and advocacy generally especially in relation to the defence of human right and international law in palestine we have already see the chilling effect on protest palestine solidarity campaign have be prevent from protest outside parliament this evening with police place restriction on the demo and push it far down whitehall for hundred of year protest outside parliament have go ahead limit dissent in this way should concern we all and we have see that in the last couple of week in relation to the terminally ill adult end of life bill abortion and the empty welfare cut the question that member of this house must ask ourselves today be whether non violent political group should ever be designate as terror threat if palestine action be proscribe this week will she give way no will not by the weekend anyone with branded shirt or bag could face terrorism charge amnesty international have flag that if palestine action be proscribe this week even meet their lawyer to discuss intervene in judicial review proceeding could see its member fall foul of counter terror legislation those be all example of potential ground for prosecution under counter terrorism law if palestine action be proscribe which could come to constituent who be not member of the organisation and have never engage in direct action the scope of what we be talk about be insanely broad will the government really demand that we vote to criminalise our constituent in that way proscribing palestine action today would set dangerous precedent for future government misuse of counter terror law it would be the first group proscribe mainly for serious damage to property and the first proscribe direct action group proscription be neither necessary nor proportionate we already have sufficient criminal legislation that have always deal with this when necessary and the home secretary have provide no impact assessment as no or no significant impact on the private voluntary or public sector be foresee however we have receive no reassurance about how the proportionality test have be apply or whether unintended impact on the wide pro palestine movement be consider by the home office and the proscription review group indeed we have hear from civil right group that there have allegedly be meeting with representative from the israeli government and arm company such as elbit but none with human right group whether or not member of this house debating and voting on this statutory instrument today agree with the method or aim of palestine action we should all be able to agree that lump palestine action together with the other two obscure group to ensure that it be proscribe be disgraceful manipulation of parliamentary procedure search hansard see that neither of the other two group have be mention as they be so obscure this manoeuvre be transparent and it show that the government know just how shaky this proscription be today they come for palestine action if this measure be pass today who and what will be next look forward to the minister answer the concern we have raise particularly about the three organisation be group together let start by put on record that know at least two people who have participate in palestine action protest but that be not why be speak today this be about fundamental principle this be chilling moment for british democracy let we be clear about what be happen political protest group be be silence be it not hugely ironic that this be be do today give that this morning hundred of woman mp include the home secretary celebrate in westminster hall the anniversary of equal vote for woman victory win by the suffragette direct action protest group have three key point first it be clear overreach to conflate direct action with terrorism secondly this will have chilling effect on the democratic right to free speech and protest thirdly it be utterly cynical of the government to wrap up the proscription of palestine action with the proscription of two other clearly terrorist group the terrorism act make it clear that strict proportionality and necessity test must be meet before any group be proscribe but this decision on palestine action be not necessary or proportionate as amnesty international and other have make clear there be ample criminal law that can be use to respond to direct action protest network such as palestine action it may have engage in criminal damage its supporter may break into airbase it may have be charge with offence such as violent disorder and aggravate burglary and it may have carry out action that absolutely do not condone indeed condemn the attack on property in stamford hill which may understandably have stir up genuine fear and find the word speak by one of its co founder at rally in the aftermath of the october hamas attack absolutely horrific but that do not make palestine action terrorist that bar be and should be extremely high it be commonly understand internationally to involve the use or threat of violence against civilian to instil fear whereas the stated aim of palestine action be to prevent war crime crime against humanity and genocide it be not just the member and supporter of palestine action who be be silence but by association million of member of the public this proscription represent grave risk to the free speech and protest right of those who be rightly concerned that genocide be happen in gaza on this government watch million of people in this country be active whether online or in their community in campaign to end the uk complicity in that genocide there be clear risk that proscribe palestine action will criminalise people who for example share social media post and there be potential for imprisonment for up to year this proscription interfere with the fundamental right of member of the public to protest against the government policy and it be clearly disproportionate in the light of the action of the group be also deeply concerned by the home office utterly cynical decision to wrap up the proscription of palestine action with that of two other group that undeniably meet the terrorism test this have clearly be do to make it extremely difficult for mp to vote against the motion want it on record that and my green party colleague absolutely oppose the proscription of palestine action and we will oppose any similar attack on the civil disobedience that be such proud part of uk history let we compare the charge against palestine action with those against the maniacs murder cult and the russian imperial movement run paramilitary training camp produce guide on how to fatally attack somebody and white supremacist neo nazis organise in support of satanism be clearly terrorist act whereas proscribe palestine action appear to be purely political move unworthy of democracy supposedly commit to human right no wonder there be significant opposition to this move across parliament include from the former lord chancellor and justice secretary lord falconer it be massive distraction from the continue horror in gaza that palestine action want to bring to an end as do many in the chamber order call nadia whittome want to make it clear to members that the order we be vote on be not about whether we support palestine action political position or protest method to vote against this motion member do not have to agree with the group at all they can still support hold it criminally liable for its action the question be whether it should be proscribe as terrorist group place alongside the like of al qaeda islamic state and national action it be fitting that this debate take place on the anniversary of woman win the vote on equal term with man thank in no small part to the suffragette the suffragette carry out direct action far more extreme than anything those in palestine action have do but today their role in change history for the well be commemorate whatever we think of its action palestine action be part of similar tradition with the target this time be to stop the genocide in gaza it be unprecedented for government to ban civil disobedience protest group in the way that they be attempt to today but what be not unprecedented be protester break into military basis that have never before result in proscription proscribing palestine action would be draconian overreach it would threaten the fundamental right to peaceful protest it would set dangerous precedent that could be use in future to further silence dissent while diminish what the terrorism act be mean to prevent be the mp for newbury where we have greenham common which be now peaceful but have cruise missile greenham common peace woman break into the base and attack jet with hammer and they be prosecute under criminal law they be hold to account do the hon member agree that under this government even greenham peace woman could have be consider terrorist organisation agree entirely with the hon member un expert urge we not to do this they state that they be concerned at the unjustified labelling of political protest movement as terrorist hundred of lawyer have write to the home secretary warn that proscribe palestine action would conflate protest and terrorism amnesty international and liberty have both express deep concern senior civil servant have brief that there be disquiet among home office staff about the decision and have call it absurd it be important to remember that this proscription would affect not just member of palestine action but anyone who support they donate to fundraiser or post positively about the group on social medium would be commit crime we risk criminalise huge number of our constituent regret our be deny the opportunity to vote separately on the proscription of palestine action the other two body be neo nazi organisation whose proscription wholeheartedly support this group together of organisation that so clearly do not belong in the same category demonstrate again why we can not allow this proscription to go ahead have no choice but to vote against the order must say that never think the day would arise when as non lawyer would be advise government of lawyer that they need to be sure of the legal basis for what they be do as say in an intervention on this subject on june it would do the country and the government no favour if they be to lose in court challenge to the process of proscription because whereas the secret sabotage of plane would certainly have be an act of terrorism lead to proscription the fact be that this be performative act that these people announce they have do official report june vol my question for the government be this will they at least adopt belt and brace policy when it come to the prosecution of the people who do that terribly irresponsible and wrong head act of sabotage those plane will they also prosecute they on the basis that they have do criminal damage and have attack the force of the crown and thereby do something that border on sedition otherwise by use the wrong aspect of the law to pursue people who do some very bad thing indeed fear the government will end up score an own goal and these people will walk free with court triumph under their belt although it be justify by the unacceptable behaviour of the perpetrator be not convince that the policy that the government have adopt will stand up in court when there be plenty of other legal method that could be use to deal with this form of extremism it be extremism but it do not in my opinion pass the threshold to be classify as terrorism in the legal sense if have be able to accept the minister offer to have word with on privy council term before the debate thank he for that offer and be sorry that be not able to take it up he may have be able to tell thing about palestine action that would have convince that it cross that threshold however if the minister be not able to say those thing in public there may be very good reason why he be not then suspect he will not be able to tell they to the court either nobody can accuse of be soft on anti militarist extremist group but say to the government with the good will in the world that they must adopt legal belt and brace policy when it come to prosecute this group and not rely on this proscription alone because fear that see trouble ahead from friend place on record my full support for the proscription of maniacs murder cult and russian imperial movement they be vile murderous and fascist cult and their place on the proscribe list be justified and necessary however it be precisely because we must take terrorism seriously that we must draw clear line to put palestine action direct action protest group in the same category as those murderous extremist organisation erode the credibility of our legal framework and risk undermine civil right proscription must be use judiciously conflate protest with terror be dangerous step that undermine the freedom that our counter terrorism law be mean to protect there be adequate provision in our criminal law to deal with any criminal activity but we be be ask to proscribe palestine action under the terrorism act to treat civil dissent whether or not we agree with it as extremism be concern shift and we risk cross line hundred of lawyer include king counsel and human right advocate have warn that such move be not hallmark of democracy we hear early today that united nations special rapporteur have express serious concern about the measure but we have not hear about the huge implication that the proscription will have for some of our community who risk be criminalise simply for show support for palestine under this proscription people could face prosecution for something as simple as wear badge share post online or attend peaceful protest the question for the house be do we really want to become society where non violently express solidarity or even speak out could be interpret as terrorism that will only further fuel fear and repression local anti racist group could suddenly find themselves under suspicion whole community could be class as suspect not for what they do but what they stand for there be numerous example of that which do not have time to set out today my hon friend the member for leeds east richard burgon have already eloquently set out number of example that frankly should send shiver down the spine of all hon member this be not the way forward non violent protest which our democracy be mean to protect now risk be label as terror the legal basis for this proscription be unsound the democratic consequence be severe and the moral cost be frankly unacceptable let be clear it will disproportionately target campaigner and minority community and set precedent that reach far beyond this one group today it be palestine action and tomorrow it could be climate activist we be stand on slippery slope proscribe protest group be not strength urge this house to defend our hard win right and civil liberty conflate protest with terrorism be not democracy therefore put on record that will not support any proscription of palestine action rise order can squeeze in one more speaker if they be brief come to this country as child it nurture educate and embrace love this country for so many reason but for two reason more than anything else suspect the first be for its sense of fairness and the second be for the freedom to express how we feel democratically that be why speak specifically about palestine action when say that if we proscribe this organisation under the terrorism act we will for the first time in this nation history outlaw domestic protest group as terrorist organisation britain have proud and often hard fight tradition of civil resistance we remember with reverence the suffragette who be brand as criminal for smash window but be now celebrate as hero of justice we remember the civil right movement in which protester occupy street and break unjust law to dismantle segregation we remember the global campaign against apartheid which include ministers in this house where people of conscience defy authority trespass and disrupt in the name of end brutal system the very freedom we hold dear today vote for woman racial equality and the end of apartheid be bear not from man and woman in suit in this establishment but from people out there it be that tradition that we be about to disrupt today this decision which have be rush through parliament in matter of day and bundle with unrelated foreign neo nazi group and debate for mere minute be reckless abuse of process it deny parliament the gravity of deliberation that this issue so badly demand the proscription have already be condemn by vast range of people from sally rooney to lord falconer and that will continue even bad this statutory instrument risk criminalise anyone who support sympathise with or even publicly praise the aim of palestine action it open the door to the prosecution of journalist filmmaker campaigner and politician for do nothing more than express solidarity this be orwellian dystopia on steroid let we ask ourselves honestly if we set this precedent who will be next history will judge harshly those who choose silence in moment of moral testing urge my colleague not to allow this dangerous step to go unchallenged do not allow home secretary in moment of political expediency permanently to expand the reach of anti terror law into the heart of domestic protest do not let this house be the one that shrink the boundary of freedom of expression we owe it to those who fight so hard for our freedom dare to dissent and refuse to be silent let we summon their courage now urge colleague to vote against this proscription and to protect our democratic tradition and our right to protest be grateful to all those who have contribute to this debate the proscription of these three organisation affirm the uk zero tolerance approach to terrorism to be clear these proscription will not affect anyone legitimate and lawful right to protest whether it be about palestine gaza or anything else will the minister give way the government have to take action when palestine action have orchestrate nationwide campaign of property damage feature attack that have result in serious damage to property and cross the legal threshold will the minister give way will not give way will the minister give way order think it be clear that at this point the minister do not wish to give way he have until pm so let we see how this progress these attack have result in serious damage to property and cross the legal threshold from direct criminal action into terrorism member have use violence against people respond at the scene of attack and have be charge with series of serious offence include violent disorder grievous bodily harm with intent and aggravate burglary which be an offence involve weapon this order would degrade their harmful activity it will also reduce the threat particularly to vulnerable individual from mmc violent content and it will reinforce our support for ukraine and our commitment to counter extreme right wing terrorism in europe on point of order madam deputy speaker mr be on my foot this be very tight debate that have to conclude at pm the minister have time he may wish to take your intervention shortly be your point of order really relevant right now it be madam deputy speaker let explain want to know whether if this order go through and go out to the demonstration that be mobilise at the moment to say that be oppose to this will be prosecute that be not point of order the minister may wish to respond he have few minute in which to do so but that be not point of order be happy to respond directly to the right hon gentleman point of order the process of proscription require this house to agree such action should the house do so later this evening it would then go to the other place and it would be for the other place to agree the action or not it would then be for the home secretary or myself to sign an order and that order would then become law at midnight on the night it have be sign will the minister give way on that point be not go to give way to the right hon gentleman what if oppose it tomorrow what if suggest it be wrong order minister continue thank you madam

proscription of the maniacs murder cult and the russian imperial movement but we be prevent from do so by the cynical way in which the government lump together those two clearly terrorist organisation with palestine action which we could not support can you please advise and the other mp who just vote no if there be any way that in future proscription order for unrelated organisation could be vote on separately so that each mp can apply their own critical assessment of whether each group have meet the test of proportionality and necessity that be require for terrorism proscription thank the hon

corporate businesses and franchisees regulatory environment motion make and question propose that this house do now mather speak long before be bear chesterton say that big business be now organize like an army it be as some would say militarism without the military virtue heaven know what he would say if he be alive now as global corporation have such influence on all our life yet it be the small and medium sized business in my lincolnshire constituency and in constituency across this country that be the backbone of our economy they also provide the particularity the colour and shape of the place that each of we call home those small and medium sized business reinvest in the community of which they be part and provide opportunity for local people we all know they from our daily experience as customer but we also know they from the representation they make to we as members of parliament today speak in the interest of those small business those entrepreneur those people who devote so much of their time skill and energy for the common good for the national interest and the common good drive all that do in this place small and medium sized business employ up to people make up about of business but just think of the influence and effect of the other when sme be accuse of wrongdoing or even of break the law they often have little in the way of resource to defend themselves so they be at the mercy of powerful regulator and the caprice of giant competitor in contrast the big multinational company which have come to dominate too much of our economy have army of compliance officer lawyer and spin doctor to bat away legitimate concern the fear that many of we in this chamber have about two tier justice run parallel to our certainty that there be two tier economy faceless heartless multinational firm often have little in the way of root here and many tech firm use such rootlessness to justify decision to pay little if any tax corporate behemoth have grow ever large ever more dominant in their sector ever more detached from their customer and ever more determined to bend rule and evade justice in recent year we have see profiteer by for example the major supermarket which very often give their supplier primary producer such as the farmer and grower in my constituency raw deal we have see they distort the food chain yet take advantage of the disruption bring by the pandemic and the war in ukraine indeed the pandemic exacerbate the power of greedy globalist follow research on big firm the trade union unite have highlight that average profit margin have soar by compare with the pre pandemic period in the profit of the large company in britain increase by about compare with pre pandemic level contrast that if you will madam deputy speaker with the plight of small business which face ever great cost and ever more unfair competition from their giant competitor what of the claim of the enthusiastic globalist that the world would be well place as result of their activity do you remember the globalist those people who be addict to modernity and change who have really benefit in an economy in which standard of living be fall productivity have stall and the state grow ever big in the face of rise worklessness it seem to that the only beneficiary of globalisation be few people at the top of those corporate business we need not monopoly but multiplicity of business such as start up firm local firm and firm that innovate and engage in new activity in the economy rather than cement exist practice let we give those business what they need which be great freedom while the big corporate monolith need to be regulate so that they do not exploit the marketplace they dominate think for moment of the bank have vision of banking hope you might too madam deputy speaker root in sort of dad army approach captain mainwaring figure commit to his community in close touch with his customer and care about the business they run that be not just fiction in my young year well remember go to bank as young man and ask if could borrow to buy an old car be student at the time the manager bit like captain mainwaring in character invite in give glass of sherry interrogate for half an hour and eventually say yes think we can probably lend you the imagine that scene now at well you would have an online connection with someone remotely situated you would get car for quid though john think my right hon friend be refer to the he still owe from the day when use to work for he the point be that nowadays the connection between customer and supplier have become at well detached and at bad remote as say now you would have conversation with some remotely situated person who know nothing about you or your circumstance and probably care less will my right hon friend give way will happily give way be it about the yes without interest agree with my right hon friend also agree about something else which be that people do not realise that the really big global multinational for example amazon do not really make their profit on what they sell they hold your datum and that be what they really sell subsequently that be where they make their money and their profit you derive no income from that datum but they make lot of money off the back of it to try to break that process down and make thing more local we have to start with what we have all be complicit in which be the idea of get something for nothing it be not for nothing there be cost my right hon friend as ever make an apposite comment the trading of datum by big business have become business in itself in the way that he set out by contrast we need firm to practise responsibility not parrot slogan and virtue signal they concentrate power and wealth with little regard to the community in which they sit or even the country in which they be situate commend the right hon gentleman he be friend to we all in this chamber and we all love he because of the wisdom he bring to it he be also good friend to northern ireland say that because he will be very pleased when he hear about what we be do in northern ireland the northern ireland well regulation strategy require department to undertake and publish regulatory impact assessment when consider new policy proposal or amendment to exist policy that may impact on business and to carry out microbusiness test to assess the impact on business of few than five employee do he not agree understand what we be do in northern ireland that with increase regulation must come increase co operation to secure well business which benefit we all the very thing he be try to achieve as ever the hon gentleman make an apposite and worthy contribution to our consideration simply say this to the minister the government have lot of power in all kind of way they certainly have the power to regulate the kind of unfair practice have begin to set out but they also have power as customer government procurement have never under successive government be use as well as it might be to support british business and in particular british small business my challenge to the minister be to look at that again let we look at how the government as huge customer of all kind of business can support small and medium sized firm decade of non intervention drive by the mistaken belief in the triumph of liberal economic have result in extraordinary number of foreign takeover of british firm it be also matter of who own these corporate giant and overseas company that own our critical national infrastructure the government recently approve the vodafone three merger and the latter company be own by hong kong base conglomerate wonder how closely the competition and markets authority look into the owner and leadership of three parent company the ck group and wonder whether that group have tie with the chinese state perhaps the minister can inform we tonight this merger must not become yet another corporate bonanza for shareholder at the expense of our national interest and the common good seek this debate in particular follow meeting with constituent who be previously vodafone franchisee along with other from across the country be mindful madam deputy speaker of legal case involve those vodafone franchisee have take advice from the table office and amend my speech heavily as result however do think it be important to set out some of the context in the broad term that have describe which relate to the behaviour of large company that adopt the franchise model congratulate the right hon gentleman on secure this debate refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests in particular my trade union membership wonder whether he share my view that the merger between vodafone and three will have real consequence for both pricing for customer and job loss in britain that be certainly the risk think merger more generally need to be look at closely it be why we have the competition and markets authority and why these thing be indeed consider in the term have describe more recently of course as my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis will know as former member of the intelligence and security committee of which remain member the government introduce other legislation in respect of security large business merger and all kind of similar and related matter it be important to gauge the national interest in all kind of way when one consider business activity rise however will say no more about that as it would be digress from my main theme and can see an eagerness to intervene give way to my neighbour be most grateful to the right hon gentleman for give way he make powerful case about the difference between small business entrepreneur franchisee and the big corporate do he share my concern that franchisee suffer the risk of what be essentially corporate bullying from the mega company the like potentially of vodafone and that they do not have any form of umbrella regulatory comfort entity such as the british franchise association may sound effective but they be actually toothless in the face of such corporate bullying have work closely with the hon gentleman as ever he and be on the same page here he be absolutely right that franchising can be use as method to exaggerate the power of the business at the heart of the franchise and to weaken the position of franchisee my assertion be that that be common and be particular in the case of vodafone rise will give way to the hon member for north durham luke akehurst and then to my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith congratulate the right hon gentleman on secure this important adjournment debate like he have meet vodafone franchisee in my constituency particularly the chester le street former franchise holder whom meet again today be grateful to the right hon gentleman for set out the legal advice he have receive on the ongoing case and will therefore be careful about what say think there be major corporate that treat their franchisee very badly they sign they up on one set of term one rate card and then change the goalpost and then when people dissent and complain about that they find their franchise withdraw and lose their investment after they have put great deal into that corporate giant think this be matter that will in the near future require ministerial attention thank the right hon gentleman very much for bring this to the house attention give way to my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green need not detain my right hon friend for long but very much support the union position on this as think this be wrong at the time without stray into the issue of the bid we should consider organisation such as ck from china it now have link with and control over uk power networks northumbrian water wales and west utilities and eversholt rail the network it have now be intriguing which be hugely around the power and communication network all of those be now fall into the hand of conglomerate that have nothing to do with the uk but that be link to government of different country this be the big problem we face it be not that we do not like big business it be just that so often now they operate from outside our legal empowerment be grateful to my right hon friend who take great interest in these matter and that be precisely why pose the early question to the minister about how closely he and other have look at that merger will say no more about it than that but it do seem to to be legitimate question to ask be those thing consider in this particular case and how be they generally consider if my right hon friend be right that there be threat that result from this under exist legislation and regulation it be perfectly possible for the government to become involved in these kind of commercial affair will the right hon gentleman give way will give way once more and then will make little more progress may put on record that do not use the term right hon in my early intervention on the right hon gentleman and wish to correct that also the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith make very important point about big business that operate outside the uk perhaps in some case abuse their position on light note may encourage he to join trade union would be happy to supply he with membership form be again grateful to the hon gentleman it seem to that there be mood across the house tonight that more must be do this minister as an experienced member of the house will have gather that that mood could easily from this small beginning become crescendo that might endanger the very safety of his office and the government as whole so let we hope that this be the beginning of journey for both the government and the minister towards regime that counter the very thing that have be describe by member across the house will the right hon gentleman give way because be long stand friend of the hon gentleman will certainly give way to he but then must make progress be very grateful to the right hon gentleman who do the house favour in his work tonight should first declare an interest as have close relative who work for the competition and markets authority do not wish to comment on competition and merger though would like to ask the right hon gentleman to join in support the government work believe that minister be shortly to do some further work to offer great support to small business in term of open up government procurement and in other matter like the right hon gentleman in my own constituency be keen supporter of small business and my own small business competition have provide great deal of recognition for business whether local florist those repair small musical instrument people provide other service and indeed many other form of small business so do want to commend the broad thrust of the right hon gentleman work tonight although do not want to comment on the cma be most grateful for the hon gentleman support during the pandemic the uk government introduce the business rate relief package which allow business with commercial lease to claim relief on their business rate that be design to help firm with physical store compensate for lost footfall during the lockdown and it be an essential lifeline to those small business this automatically apply to business through local council from march to june the relief be with no cash cap and ratepayer with more than one property be entitle to relief for each eligible property franchisee be eligible to receive this relief and it would have be automatically apply to store operate by company such as vodafone and not through the franchise programme it be worth note that some corporation that benefit from that scheme such as tesco although hold no candle for tesco generally have since return the money to the government the question be how vodafone use that money do it achieve its original purpose would be interested to hear the minister answer to that question or be it redirect in some way that be out of tune with the government intention and the proper purpose it be worth note that that be available not only to vodafone but to all those organisation that have franchise wonder how other organisation handle the matter and how that compare with the circumstance surround vodafone the important thing to consider as we debate these matter be that the franchisee be small business owner with family this be important to they business rate relief be of huge significance and make meaningful difference to people as intend by the chancellor at the time my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak the government state purpose for business relief be to assist small business to carry on trading at financially difficult time when profit in brick and mortar shop be much reduce the question be be that the reality the fact that the government later introduce cap on the relief indicate that it be intend to help small business those to whom make great difference not to subsidise large globalist corporation with hundred of store and access to other type of relief what be the minister assessment of how that kind of funding be use during the covid pandemic too often franchisee payment from those who franchise they be cut drastically and with little or no explanation contract be often terminate with just few day notice and store repossess with little notice often without valid reason for do so leave debt and loan to be repay with no income franchisee claim that they face fine and clawback that be grossly disproportionate to the error in question in some case the error that lead to fine be the result of failure in major corporation system yet the financial burden be often unfairly place on franchisee communication raise serious concern though make be often unanswered and press issue be ignore for long period of time leave franchisee without support or resolution to their problem moreover it have emerge that whistleblower have warn series of senior vodafone executive that score of its franchise store owner face financial ruin what step be the government take to regulate corporate business relationship with their franchisee as say we be not speak of powerful business with deep legal department and balance sheet to absorb loss but ordinary people mother father son and daughter who see an opportunity when they become franchisee to build meaningful business of their own under the banner of global household name and to make difference to their family their community and the town in which they be situate people put their saving their home and their reputation on the line because they believe that franchise agreement with company such as vodafone there be other too would be safe and secure last month the competition and markets authority confirm the merger of vodafone and three will the minister confirm that the matter of the problem with franchisee be discuss ahead of that merger be approve indeed more broadly can such merger really be say to benefit the british public give that it be forecast to cost uk job and that evidence from overseas show that country with few mobile phone operator tend to charge high price to consumer will the minister confirm what step the government be take to investigate allegation of inappropriate use of government relief during the covid pandemic specifically in relation to business with franchisee will the minister confirm that all allegation of misappropriation of government relief scheme intend for franchisee should be investigate as part of the inquiry into covid by the covid commissioner will the minister urge bank to show leniency and support to those franchisee face financial distress and will he commit to look afresh at the lack of enforceable regulation govern franchiser conduct key lesson from the post office scandal be that we must not allow the sophisticated power of corporate body or the impression create by an impressive balance sheet to persuade we to ignore the voice of less powerful individual who speak out many franchisee have give up stable job some have take out personal loan and some have remortgage their home they train staff open store serve customer and be tell by the big business that they be partner but when the going get rough when the commission cut come with little warning when franchisee performance plummet due to decision beyond their control and when store be repossess with inadequate notice they be leave out on their own high and dry no lifeline no dialogue just silence from the corporation that they once trust can not believe that this minister do not feel as do about corporate malpractice about greedy soulless heartless firm that act irresponsibly and hide behind the high wall of their substance government have duty not only to promote entrepreneurship and business but to protect entrepreneur and ensure that business do not take unfair advantage of their staff we must call time on the era of corporate giant use legal structure not as framework for partnership but as shield for avoidance for avoid responsibility and decency brand that trade on their reputation and public trust must be hold accountable for the action that they take that cause real harm we must move away from globalist faceless corporate model that have enrich few and towards different kind of economic order in which we shorten supply line encourage small and medium sized business and understand that economic must serve civil purpose call that fraternal economic an economic in which community and economic activity be bind together in common cause we can build that kind of economic future but it require government to know when to step forward to support business and when to step back and not suffocate entrepreneurship that future be within our grasp but it will require this government perhaps any government to think afresh about the power balance between large faceless business and small entrepreneur they be ordinary people like most of we guess who simply want to get on and do the good for their family and their community know which side be on be on the side of those people because know that they make so much difference in my constituency and across the whole of our kingdom in the usual way thank the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes for secure this debate have cross sword with he when our position be reverse approach this debate with particular wariness not least because he have assemble very distinguished cross party group of member to participate in this debate we hear from not only the right hon gentleman but the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith my hon friend the members for stockport navendu mishra for north durham luke akehurst and for read central matt rodda and the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice each of they make important point very much agree with the open remark of the right hon member for south holland and the deeping about small and medium sized business be the backbone of our community they be important they be fundamental to the strength of each of our constituency the government be determined to do much more to support our sme go forward that be why on the point make by my hon friend the member for read central we will publish strategy for support sme the right hon member for south holland and the deepings be right that we as country should do more to celebrate our entrepreneur and to champion their interest they be brave they be risk taker they create wealth and they make all our community well and rich we be determined to encourage more people to come forward as entrepreneur to take risk and succeed and to grow business we have already take number of measure to support sme the secretary of state for business and trade have already commit to establish business growth service inspire by the us small business administration that be why one of the outcome of the spending review be two third increase in the capacity of the british business bank the vast majority of that funding will go to help tackle the considerable challenge that sme face in access the right form of financial support the right hon gentleman rightly raise the issue of access to public procurement for british sme be sympathetic about the need to open up public procurement to sme again we will have more to say on that in the small business strategy when it be publish shortly cabinet office colleague be very much work in this space too the right hon gentleman also rightly raise the matter of the difficulty that small and medium sized business face when legal issue arise again we will have more to say on that in the small business strategy shortly towards the end of his remark he make powerful link to an appalling miscarriage of justice the scandal of how the post office treat its sub postmaster there be many lesson to learn from that hope that he will take confidence from the government determination to do that when he see the green paper on the future of the post office which we be seek to bring forward be sure that the whole house appreciate the work that sir wyn williams be do to draw conclusion about what go wrong in the scandal and about what more we need to do to learn the lesson and ensure that nothing like that ever happen again thank the hon gentleman for the way in which he be respond there be close parallel between the way the post office be construct its business arrangement and the connection between independent post office and the centre and the matter that describe will he ensure that his small business strategy include something on franchising that be really important part of get right our approach to regulation on the relationship between small business and corporate giant have already give flavour of what might be in the small business strategy will leave the right hon gentleman to wait little long if may he will have to forgive before he see the strategy in full let come to the substance of the right hon gentleman concern he rightly and understandably mention the experience of number of franchise operator who allege mistreatment and be badly let down by vodafone during covid no one in the chamber will have fail to have be move by those story have read number of they in correspondence from colleague on both side of the house there be without question serious allegation be level at vodafone as the right hon gentleman say and as be sure he will understand be unable to comment on ongoing legal dispute but will respond on behalf of the government as good can give the ongoing nature of the case until now there have not be sustain concern about the quality or effectiveness of the self regulation of franchise in general however recognise that this case have raise concern across the house and will track very carefully what happen in this case the final outcome and the conclusion of any court case as hon member will no doubt be aware franchising be grow in the uk and it make big contribution to our economy at just over billion annually accord to the late british franchise association survey the franchising industry be cover by the same general protection in law as other business and will come on to some of those in moment in addition the franchising industry also effectively self regulate through the british franchise association which have code of ethic and the quality franchise association which provide code of conduct on the whole as the house will recognise there be significant advantage to self regulation great flexibility and responsiveness and low cost be the minister aware this be my understanding from the franchisee that vodafone leave the bfa and walk away from its self regulatory framework and code of conduct my hon friend will forgive but will not comment on the particular circumstance of vodafone and its relationship with franchisee in general or those former franchisee who be bring court action however note his comment have work with the minister on number of issue relate to his ministerial role and he have always be helpful and proactive as he be represent his majesty government do he feel that there be need to legislate on this issue and that the code of conduct simply do not go far enough also as my hon friend the member for north durham luke akehurst have just say there might be case of large corporation opt in and out as and when it suit they as say recognise that this case have raise concern across the house about the quality and effectiveness of the legislation that govern franchisee and indeed other business and about the arrangement around franchisee and their relationship as say up to now we have not have significant representation that the quality of regulation of franchise be not adequate however recognise the concern across the house that this case have bring up and as result will track very carefully how the court case unfold be note the advantage that on occasion self regulation bring they include freedom when it come to contracting individual and business have the right to enter into agreement and set their own term free from unnecessary government interference that freedom allow franchise agreement to be tailor to individual need people can set up shop more easily on the high street or elsewhere with the power of big brand behind they on the whole self regulation also allow the franchise industry to set standard and guideline base on deep industry specific expertise it allow the industry to adapt more quickly to market change too it be my understanding that the franchise agreement be the main instrument govern the relationship between franchisor and franchisee those agreement normally cover key issue such as fee territory right contract duration and dispute resolution mechanism the government of course encourage anyone enter business contract such as franchise to seek independent legal advice before agree to the term and condition lay out in those agreement have talk little bit about self regulation and its benefit and allude early to the fact that there be exist protection in law that cover all business include franchise for example under the misrepresentation act anyone who have enter into contract as result of misrepresentation may be able to rescind the contract and claim damage misrepresentation be false statement by one party to another that induce that person to enter the contract ultimately it would be for the court to decide whether misrepresentation have occur and what the remedy would be there be other form of legislation too include the unfair contract terms act which may apply to business to business contract that reference the application of reasonableness test but that again be matter for dedicated legal advice the minister be absolutely right of course contract law be well establish and business contract be enforceable in the way that he set out but the problem with franchising be that it be hierarchical relationship that create kind of dependency the franchisee be dependent on the large business so there be an in build advantage if that large business be inclined to be permissive in the way that it apply the term of the contract or even vary its term the parallel draw in my speech be with supermarket and primary producer the supermarket have so much power that the primary producer be implicitly weaken in that commercial relationship the right hon gentleman make very interesting speech with series of interesting analogy and have note those and the point that he make as have say will track this particular court case and its conclusion always try to make myself available when hon and right hon member want to discuss particular issue that be pertinent to my brief and as thing unfold make that offer to the right hon gentleman too should stress again that only the court can really decide on the application of contractual term it be absolutely right that affected business seek independent legal advice on the particular circumstance of their situation as the right hon gentleman will be fully aware legislation can not prevent wrongdoing it can deter and it can punish but only after the event it be important for company obviously to conduct business fairly we already have rule that encourage this whether in relation to criminal offence of fraud audit requirement or prompt payment reporting which my department have begin to strengthen and on which we will publish further proposal shortly be sure the right hon gentleman will agree that investor and the public expect and deserve access to truthful reporting from our most important business on their finance and related issue this be critical for trust and ultimately it be critical for economic growth that be why through the audit and corporate governance reform bill we be develop legislation to uphold standard and the independent scrutiny of company account while ensure real accountability for company director section of the companies act already require company director to frame regard in their decision make to wide range of stakeholder interest that include the impact of the company operation on the wide community it also require director to have regard to the desirability of the company maintain reputation for high standard of business conduct this requirement apply to company business transaction include the treatment of franchisee large company must report annually on how their director have comply with these requirement take together the section duty help to provide assurance that company be run responsibly and that director be mindful of the impact of their decision making beyond the company and its shareholder the right hon gentleman touch on the additional regulation of franchise and the wide franchise model as he will know this government be dedicate to implement an ambitious regulatory reform agenda in march we publish our action plan for regulation outline change to streamline rule and regulation to support growth while that plan include clear commitment to cut regulatory administrative cost for business by it also include commitment to strengthen accountability for regulator that include simplify their duty to ensure that the regulatory environment focus on growth investment and crucially transparency our modern industrial strategy also include an ambitious package of regulatory reform that will support our growth drive sector and the wide economy but as we state at its launch that be not the end of the journey it be just the beginning where there be change that we can make to increase the uk economic resilience and channel support to the most productive part of our economy we want to continue to work with member across this house to implement they in conclusion let thank the right hon gentleman and other hon member who have participate in the debate franchise regulation be complex and difficult issue and as have say this particular case have raise concern across the house as promise will continue to look closely at how the case develop and ultimately what conclusion be reach be happy to continue conversation about this case and its implication outside the chamber question put and agree to house adjourn defer divisions competition that the draft enterprise act mergers involving newspaper enterprises and foreign powers regulations which be lay before this house on may be approve diane abbott jack abbott debbie abrahams zubir
