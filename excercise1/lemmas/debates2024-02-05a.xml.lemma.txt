first welcome the right hon gentleman support for this action he ask series of question which will rattle through be the action effective yes they hit the target be all the target hit again yes we be still carry out surveillance to find out the exact impact but think we can be very confident that all the relevant objective be reach we combine very closely with our us colleague and sometimes interchange some of those target with they the right hon gentleman will have note that on this occasion we be involve in drop munition on more target than previously so we carry slightly great weight than before the right hon gentleman ask whether the action be successful and rightly point out that what we be see be rather more sporadic the attack include on hms diamond and on merchant shipping have continue but in much more ad hoc fashion it be perhaps relevant that there have be no attack use multiple different weapon at the same time which we see for example on january the degrading will have have some impact on that will come back to the right hon gentleman comment about the prime minister at the end want to set the record straight the right hon gentleman ask about operation prosperity guardian the simple answer of course be that none of we know how long it will need to continue for but we want it to come to conclusion as quickly as possible we utterly reject any notion that these continue attack by the houthis be anything to do with the situation in gaza the houthis be opportunist pirate who be use situation to their benefit few year ago they do not even support hamas but suddenly they want to be their great champion they be over kilometre away from gaza they be simply use the situation to their advantage and it be wise for the house to not over link the two none the less the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to about the need to see humanitarian truce and sustainable ceasefire that be the government policy we be work extremely hard to try to achieve that include through discussion that the prime minister the foreign secretary and myself be have just yesterday be have those discussion in the middle east the right hon gentleman ask about raf flight the issue be not get the aid to location have be work very closely with the cypriot government for example on how we can increase the amount of aid the single big problem remain get the aid into the country we have some success with get kerem shalom open but what we really need to see be ashdod open in order to route that aid to kerem shalom and straight into gaza the government and will continue to push for that route but the problem be not the flight take off it be the aid get in finally turn to the fact that it be myself as defence secretary stand at the dispatch box rather than the prime minister the first thing to say be that it be the secretary of state for defence who actually have legal responsibility for these action who sign off the target and indeed the legal authority technically it be who should be stand here other than for the first couple of round where the prime minister be deal with something new and it be therefore very appropriate for he to be at the dispatch box the wide point that would gently make to the right hon gentleman though be that the prime minister be in northern ireland today do incredibly important hear from sedentary position the suggestion that we should have be recall yesterday but unsure whether that would have be entirely practical it be entirely appropriate that the prime minister be in northern ireland would have think that the house would welcome the fact that that historic breakthrough have be mark by the prime minister and it be very appropriate that be here today to explain the activity of saturday night to the house although it be clear that the houthi attack have not end as the shadow defence secretary say there do appear to have be difference in the cadence the mass attack that we see on january for example have not be repeat partly because the houthis ability have be degrade however we be always look at other mean include route via the united nations and at the wide picture of for instance the peace treaty between saudi arabia and yemen all those element fit into the way in which we be apply pressure to try to bring the situation to close debbie abrahams tahir ali fleur anderson jon
