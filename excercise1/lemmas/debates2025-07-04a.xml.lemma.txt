delighted to present this bill for its third reading begin by state how grateful be to all the members from across the house who have engage with this bill especially during the public bill committee it become quite clear very quickly how passionate every committee member be about animal welfare and we have huge amount of contribution with many take the opportunity to name check their own pet from home think have hear every cat name during my year in clinical practice but have to say that be really impress by the imagination of the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter who reveal that her cat be name clement catlee and mo meowlam my many year in veterinary practice work both in winchester and in romsey in your beautiful constituency madam deputy speaker as well as around the rest of country have show just how deeply the people of this nation care for their pet they be companion and they be sometimes sole companion to people who live alone have lose count of the number of time especially during covid that we be treat animal and someone would say have see anyone else for month and my dog or my cat be my only companion pet be absolutely vital for many people mental health especially when we have an epidemic of loneliness pet be sometimes part of the antidote to that my constituency be the home of canine partners the organisation that provide canine companion for individual with disability just want to reflect on the positive effect those dog have on the people who care for they there be so many fantastic organisation like canine partners another one be the cinnamon trust if person end up go into hospital for an extended period of time the cinnamon trust will take care of their pet for they and give it back to they when they be discharge that take away so much of the worry my partner emma and have two dog frank and moose frank have be mention before in parliament because manage to wish he very happy birthday recently he be pug cross border terrier think the good way to describe how he look with his undershot jaw and his big buggy eye be quirky admit that he get mixed reception one liberal democrat member see picture of he and call he ugly which be horrendously offend by hon member shame it be awful shame we be at one of my friend house for dinner recently and one of their child look at frank and say frank be really ugly the other child say you should say that because he might have be in an accident it be possibly genetic accident but want to make clear on the record that beneath his appearance he be gentle and love companion and he bring smile to the face of everyone who see he know that many other member as well as people across the country will feel as strongly about protect animal welfare as and other vet do pet like frank and moose have such profound impact on our everyday life and happiness and it be crucial that we do all we can to ensure dog like they be protect from the cruel practice involve in pet smuggling all of the pet who have be mention in this chamber and other who have not be be close to our heart and serve to remind we of the importance of this bill although my pet and yours madam deputy speaker alfie and alfie and luna alfie and luna they be cockapoo be sure they keep you very fit although our pet and all the pet of the other hon member who be in the chamber today be well care for and have love home that be not the case for all cat and dog in the uk as vet have see the devastating consequence of puppy smuggling it be unimaginably cruel to separate puppy and kitten from their mother at very young age and then bring they across border in substandard condition where they be sell for maximum profit by unscrupulous trader who prioritise profit over welfare thank my hon friend for introduce this bill which know mean lot to the great number of my constituent who have contact they be particularly concerned about the condition that puppy be smuggle in but also that many animal come into this country illegally bring condition that we have eradicate here or have crop ear and tail they be very keen to see my hon friend bill pass but can he assure we that more can be do in future to make sure in particular that we stamp out those illness very much appreciate that intervention from my hon friend yes one important part of this bill which will come on to be biosecurity there be lot of disease that we do not see in the uk that can affect human as well such as rabie and brucella canis there be also disease such as distemper that affect other dog we do not see those disease in the uk but there be risk of they come in and become endemic my partner emma who be here today be an epidemiologist at the university of surrey study disease such as rabie in dog and the risk of they transfer across border it be very live issue those who purchase an animal be often completely unaware of the smuggling process which be devastating when people go to buy puppy they be completely unaware that there be reasonable chance that it have be smuggle in from abroad my hon friend be lay out clearly the need for change number of my constituent include ann from bredbury shannon from marple and ashley from high lane have be in touch to ask to support he in his endeavour people be stagger that some of these practice be not yet outlaw do he agree that some of his proposal in the bill be close loophole that people already expect to be close that be an insightful intervention from my hon friend yes most people be shock at the sheer scale of puppy smuggling the dogs trust do study look at one of the online platform with puppy advert and up to of those advert turn out to be for puppy that have possibly be smuggle in from abroad in the last month one in five vet say they have treat animal that they believe have be smuggle from abroad this be not niche issue it be systemic issue within the pet trade and these loophole need to be close thank the hon member for introduce this fantastic bill which do important thing for animal welfare sadly my constituency have problem with dog on dog attack which be truly distress to their owner the overwhelming majority of dog owner in my constituency be incredibly responsible and keep their dog under control at all time but tiny minority be do great deal of damage do the hon member have any thought on what we could do about that dog on dog attack be huge issue it largely come down to socialisation when they be puppy it be make lot bad during the covid pandemic when people could not attend normal puppy training class and puppy could not walk and meet other dog or have normal training regime will also come on to the problem of dog have illegally crop ear when their ear be cut off because dog communicate by body language and part of their body language be ear position if they can not move their ear they can not communicate in normal way to other dog that they be not threat and they be more likely to get into fight and difficulty it be the same if their tail be cut off and they can not show whether they be happy sad angry or confident when owner buy new puppy often they do not realise that it have be smuggle and take from its mother far too soon that can cause lot of medical issue and other disease such as parvo virus it be not unusual for someone to buy new puppy and within the first week or two have to go to the vet repeatedly with very sick animal whose problem be often quite hard to diagnose sometimes these disease be fatal there be few thing more heartbreaking than family who within few day of ownership not only have an expensive veterinary bill but have lose their new puppy thank the hon member for introduce this important bill which support he talk about the impact of disease that puppy might have when they be bring in do he agree that there be also disease that have potential impact on human health often for the veterinary surgeon or nurse who be look after they for example disease such as brucella canis could lead to miscarriage for lady if she be look after one of those puppy while pregnant know that the hon lady speak with authority as her husband be vet thank she for sit on the committee and for push the bill through she also have private member bill on animal welfare she make an important point that have be consume the veterinary profession for the last couple of year lot of dog bring in from abroad have disease call brucella canis which can affect human it can cause infertility and miscarriage obviously if dog have be illegally smuggle in owner might not be aware of the risk because they assume it have be bear in the uk it be huge human health risk as well just last night be still receive message from veterinary colleague about treat animal that they strongly suspect have be smuggle in because of the type of illness that they be see that be why we be strive to end those practice by deliver the measure in the bill the bill close loophole in our pet travel rule that be currently exploit it do so by reduce the number of animal permit per non commercial movement from five per person to five per vehicle include vehicle on board train or ferry and to three per person for foot or air passenger careful consideration have be give to set these limit balance the need to disrupt illegal trade with minimise the impact on genuine pet owner to underpin this only an owner not an authorised person will be permit to sign declaration that the movement of dog or cat be non commercial crucially the bill place duty on the government to use these regulation make power to deliver three key measure ban on the import of puppy and kitten under six month old ban on the import of heavily pregnant dog and cat that be more than day pregnant and ban on the import of dog and cat that have be mutilate raise the minimum age at which dog and cat can be import will ensure that very young animal be not take from their mother too soon separate puppy or kitten from its mother too young have huge implication for its health and welfare thank the hon member for bring forward this very important bill the point about very young animal be really pertinent in my family we have two kitten they be bring into our house at an appropriate age and we can see the importance of their first relationship after birth one of my constituent own ferret and meet both those ferret at civic event in my constituency of watford they clearly have personality and it be really important that this bill seek to protect they yes ferret be some of the most quirky and engage creature you can ever meet great personality have to say hate they come into the consult room because you can smell that they have be there for several hour afterwards but they bring lot of joy and pleasure to the people who own they we anticipate that trader may respond to an increase in the minimum age for import puppy and kitten by increase the number of pregnant dog and cat that they import the evidence from stakeholder suggest that even at present trader be import very heavily pregnant dog and cat in order to benefit from their trade as soon as the puppy and kitten be bear because it be much cheap and easy to bring in an animal before it give birth than to try to move whole load of puppy we know that some dog be be take back and forth they get pregnant again and then be bring back to give birth it really be abuse of these bitch they be basically puppy factory the transportation of heavily pregnant dog and cat be dangerous to the health and welfare of both the mother and the offspring especially in heatwave give the heat inside van when they have few pregnant dog in the back so it be paramount that we remain on the front foot and use the bill to prevent this practice become commonplace the bill will raise the minimum age at which cat and dog can be import to ensure that very young animal be not take from their mother too soon and that we can age puppy and kitten more accurately currently the minimum age be technically week but it be very hard even for vet to accurately age animal by the time they get to six month old they have lose all their deciduous tooth their baby tooth and have mostly adult tooth so we can be much more confident about their age raise the minimum age will be much well for their welfare but it will also help tackle the criminal business model because the demand be for puppy not dog that be over six month we hope that if people can not bring in dog at six month old it will take away the incentive to try to get they across the border come to mutilation which include ear cropping the declawing of cat and tail docking it be very cruel and should not be tolerate for anyone who be not aware ear cropping be when someone cut dog ear off to make it look more aggressive it often happen to breed such as xl bully and dobermanns it have be illegal in the uk for more than decade since think people be still perform the procedure in the uk without veterinary supervision and probably with no anaesthetic and then claim that the dog have be bring in from abroad because it be still legal to bring they in from abroad receive message last night from about dozen vet say that just in the last couple of month they have treat dog that have clearly have their ear hack off in the uk and that now have infection and need the rest of the ear amputate this be go on now the great thing about close that loophole be that there will be no excuse for own dog in the uk with cropped ear and no one will be able to claim that such dog have be bring in from abroad one of the great beauty of this bill be that it apply to scotland too do the hon gentleman agree that it will make the prosecution of ear cropping relate case easy in scotland for the benefit of our wonderful dog clarity about the fact that there be no excuse for have dog with crop ear should make prosecution and enforcement of the law lot more straightforward will read out message that receive from veterinary colleague last night just see for repeat med check this week crop doberman import but clearly be very young and owner be not give any passport or paper he have his ear crop supposedly do abroad before be import but be probably do in the uk lovely bright dog until anyone put hand towards his head when it will explode with aggression big enough dog to be life threaten if child approach he now exist near permanently muzzle and dose up on prozac it madden frustrating and pitiful all at the same time cut dog ear off with no anaesthetic be obviously physically harmful but it can also affect the dog psychology for the rest of their life so they will not let anyone go near their head it be quite interesting we know that dog love to be stroke particularly on their head and study show that both human and dog cortisol level go down when human pet dog the relationship be mutual and symbiotic deprive an animal of that type of relationship for the rest of its life be really upsetting what be the point in own dog if you can not even stroke it it be real shame there be no reason to mutilate an animal in this way it be cruel practice only carry out for aesthetic reason and the bill will help we to close that loophole for good the bill be amend in committee to allow the appropriate authority to exempt pet owner from the new requirement in article and of the pet travel regulation in exceptional and compelling circumstance this aim to ensure that the new measure will not disadvantage protect group such as assistance dog user it will also provide flexibility in emergency situation such as case where genuine owner can no long travel within five day of their pet for example because they have medical emergency know that have cause some concern and reassure hon member that it be intend for use in limited circumstance which must be exceptional or compelling exemption seek will need to be consider on case by case basis and the government have provide reassurance that no blanket exemption will be grant finally in committee the bill be amend to remove the power that would have enable the secretary of state to make consequential change that might have be require as result of change that the bill make to the pet travel rule and correspond commercial import rule further consideration of the legislation have take place since the bill be introduce and we have great confidence that no further consequential amendment will be require should far change to the pet travel scheme legal framework be need the government may be able to make they use exist power in other legislation the bill will play pivotal role in disrupt the cruel pet smuggling trade share objective of member from across the house it have be joy to see the house unite on animal welfare and to see the commitment to work together across party to end puppy smuggling urge all member to support these crucial measure thank the hon member for winchester dr chambers for bring forward the bill and for all his work to get it to this stage we should also thank the former hon member for north devon who understand bring forward the bill in the previous parliament it do not quite get through parliament before the general election it be good to see propose legislation move from one parliament to the next and have cross party support the hon gentleman represent winchester madam deputy speaker you and share relationship as be romsonian and you represent my parent but one of my first job be in winchester in the esso garage by peter symonds college so know the hon gentleman constituency very well that be the job that get through university and earn money in the summer holiday one of my proud achievement be be give the opportunity to step up and take on the night shift which be double pay for student that be very exciting unfortunately lose that job because fall asleep on my shift and someone steal the carwash while be asleep yes be demote back to daytime shift but winchester always have place in my heart it be great relief to know that two member of this house sabotage their petrochemical career quite early on have job in garage as an year old can not remember the brand make the fatal mistake of fill up car salesman brand new car with diesel when it be an unleaded car that be why never rise to the top of british petroleum should state for the record and for colleague in hansard that be not my hon friend the member for bracknell peter swallow as be suggest early this week for those online be not my hon friend the member for weston super mare dan aldridge either whom be quote as be this week nor be member of much bad version of one direction that idea go viral this week thank to one of my former labour colleague who temporarily make twitter famous be very passionate member of the labour animal welfare society and would like to thank the society for all its hard work during the election period on this campaign when we put out social medium post and speak to resident right across the political spectrum it be very clear that there be real support for change and much tough animal welfare measure the conservatives when in government fail to take action on collar on ban import from trophy hunting fur and foie gra on ban snare and other inhumane device that be already ban in wales and scotland and this be really critical for every pet owner on the theft of pet it be really positive to see these measure now come forward on my hon friend point about social medium do he have view on the importance of have dog in your social medium during general election campaign it seem to be an almost compulsory element of many of the campaign be involve in include mine surely the bill be critical to ensure the good nature of the animal appear in those social medium post completely agree be candidate for month and for long while run doorstepdogs every week take photo of my favourite dog that meet on the doorstep unfortunately have give up on that maybe should bring it back that be very good point about social medium one reason why there be such an interest in dog with cropped ear be that lot of influencer on instagram and other social medium platform pose with dog or show that they have new dog with cropped ear many people be not aware that it be mutilation they think it be how dog ear normally look that drive demand for dog that look like that we will be run stop the crop campaign to try to get influencer and company that use crop eare dog in advert to stop do that so that cropping be not normalise among the general public thank the hon gentleman for raise that point it be fantastic to hear about that campaign and would fully support it but there be also positive in the world of pet on social medium follow an account southend dog training which have help with free advice to ensure that dash my little chorkie full name dash potato evans reader sit walk and do not lick so many people every time we meet they he do not come out with on the doorstep because while be try to talk about serious policy issue he be more keen to get in the house and explore in all seriousness the bill be really important it close loophole and stop the shameless exploitation of dog cat and ferret as learn from the clerk as walk in ferret be include in the bill because of their alignment on rabie categorisation it be fantastic to see really well rounded bill of this nature it will stop puppy be strip from their parent and smuggle into the uk under the age of six month and it will stop heavily mutate dog be bring in as well as heavily pregnant dog who just become puppy farm be at food conference in northampton yesterday and when tell people there that be come in to parliament today to talk about puppy they think it be little strange but explain the loophole and they be not fully aware of what go on it be really important that we take this kind of action to close those loophole first must confess that be feel increasingly guilty for not have mention my cockapoo brora since everybody else be mention their pet she have be social medium star she pose in scotland football strip just before the last championship the hon gentleman make good point about people not be aware and need reassurance when we buy brora five year ago remember it be on my mind that we have to be careful because there be lot of people sell puppy on the internet apparently genuinely have hear from constituent who buy puppy unaware of the puppy trade and then face the sort of issue that my hon friend the member for winchester dr chambers mention do the hon gentleman agree that it be important that the public take away from this bill an awareness of those danger could not agree more it be critical that we do more in parliament to raise these issue also welcome some of the minor amendment make in committee which strengthen the bill far and will reassure people particularly in the limited circumstance in which the bill may have unintended consequence it be the story of my life that be dog lover and an animal lover every time come home from parliament dash be there wait for very fortunately he come with when come down to london and he come with back to northampton it make my life so much well as you say to come home decompress the hon gentleman be do marvellous job but he have use you number of time as indeed have other member in their intervention while be on the subject of intervention it be fascinating for personally to hear about the social medium account of everybody dog but could we please try to keep intervention within scope of the bill thank you madam deputy speaker you make good point as be say when come home and see dash it be great opportunity to decompress agree with the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine that that be such valuable part of own dog in closing want to thank number of organisation that have help and other to really understand this issue four paws battersea and the countryside alliance have provide great briefing and have help and other to understand it today be victory for common sense and animal welfare one way or another we will make sure that we improve animal welfare right in this place congratulate the hon member for winchester dr chambers on introduce this important bill it be an absolute honour and privilege to speak on this subject have speak on animal welfare in two westminster hall debate in the past month and it be an important topic to speak about on the anniversary of my election so be grateful for the opportunity be also an animal lover know that all right hon and hon member present be extremely well informed so the fact and information will share be not for their benefit want to use this opportunity to provide some education for community across our country and to share the message far afield beyond this place as mahatma gandhi say the greatness of nation and its moral progress can be judge by the way its animal be treat we often say we be nation of animal lover and today be test if we legislate we must legislate like one cruel practice like smuggle pregnant animal or separate young animal from their mother at an early age violate all level of mercy these act cause unnecessary suffering and must be stop have research and have information provide by my team find the scale of the issue staggering between and dog import under the pet travel scheme rise by many of those be illegal or misclassified commercial import single journey from romania to the uk be over mile puppy as young as week be transport in cramped filthy van we have hear about cropped ear cruel thing to do to any animal more than dog with cropped ear be now estimate to be in the uk population result of the legal grey area that we hope the bill will address pay tribute and express my gratitude be sure on behalf of the house to the many charity and organisation that look after animal welfare and ensure issue be bring to the attention of this place and that be on the ground help battersea dogs trust countryside alliance and many more that be local regional national and international it be important to share some of the key issue around biosecurity and health risk many smuggled puppy and kitten arrive in the uk without the core vaccination require to prevent rabie distemper parvovirus and other life threaten illness these animal be often too young to have receive their vaccination or to have develop any immunity that be dangerous for they and also pose serious public health risk to our community and domestic pet population the current system allow these animal to enter the country with minimal scrutiny create perfect entry point for zoonotic disease those that can jump from animal to human will share two or three case study from battersea milo six month old dog rescue by battersea have be brutally mutilate his ear be hack and crudely stitch shut with cotton thread which have be leave to fester that be not just illegal it be deliberate torture masquerade as aesthetic enhancement we need to tackle the glorification of mutilate animal on social medium or any other platform that do not make it clear to the people view that it be not the natural state of the animal it have be mutilate that be an important point that hope through this debate will become more well know to give some more example sunny ray and sky three cane corso puppy be traffic over mile from romania they be just week old under the legal import age and unvaccinate mutilate and force into cramped stressful condition their ear have be crop and their tail dock all illegal here but still allow under import loophole snowy heavily pregnant dog be smuggle during the final of her pregnancy in breach of current law she endure the journey in squalid dark and suffocating condition without adequate food or water these journey not only traumatise the animal but endanger the life of unborn puppy and the mother carry they do not have much experience of the importation of animal into our country until my preparation for this and previous debate be aware that in my constituency there be an illegal trade of puppy which be keep in small cramped cage outside until they reach the age when they can be sell these cruelly treat puppy can be sell for thousand and thousand of pound hope that part of the work we be do on the bill can also look to address that on the exploitation of loophole we have hear that the current pet travel scheme design for holidaymaker have be systematically abuse by organise puppy trafficker breeder mislabel commercial sale as personal pet movement to sidestep import rule veterinary check and regulation smuggle heavily pregnant dog be deliberate move allow trafficker to appear legitimate by show the puppy with their mother deceive buyer into think that the litter be breed responsibly in the uk these be not one off case this be organised animal trafficking often international in scale that thrive on weak legislation poor enforcement and consumer deception without the bill we be effectively enable profit from pain through loophole ride system that be ripe for abuse on constituent engagement on this issue through battersea alone over people across constituency have contact their mp to urge they to support the bill this be groundswell of support that cut across party line while have only have one email from constituent directly about the bill have have over email in this parliament from constituent call for strong animal welfare protection this speak to powerful public mandate people be demand action to end the suffering of trafficked animal and uphold the uk reputation as leader on welfare pass this bill be the right and compassionate thing to do when one think of dog and their close relationship with human good place to start be literature great novel about our relationship with dog be white fang by jack london great american socialist writer when it come to cat can do no well than natsume sōseki the great japanese writer who write series of novel about cat observe their human master with great wit and intelligence as boy have three dog or rather my father do they be pistol poins and muttley my dad believe that dog should be name after shakespearean character hence pistol and poins but the balance of power shift in the family and then we have muttley the hanna barbera dog though we draw the line at huckleberry hound something very important about the dog be that they be all stray they have great emotional difficulty in be able to trust human because they be mistreat when they be young that be why the hon member for winchester dr chambers be right to emphasise the real damage that cruelty to animal can do the next door neighbour have two cat butch and cuddles and the clue be somewhat in their name they be stray cat butch take long time to trust the next door neighbour and my family and but he do trust we now if animal suffer cruelty when they be young it cause long term psychological damage be delighted that the bill extend to scotland this house should not be afraid to legislate for the welfare of people or animal in scotland so commend the hon member for winchester for seek to legislate for scotland it be very important to my constituent we have the dogs trust in broomhouse in my constituency which my good friend councillor lalley take to visit the people there do huge amount of good work with stray dog may take moment to mention dobermann rescue base in my constituency which also do fantastic work be sure my hon friend will join in commend its work will join my hon friend in commend the work of that dobermann charity dog like dobermanns and german shepherd have certain reputation but they be very kind love and loyal so commend work that be do to help dobermanns there be great deal of support in my constituency for the bill which have many important element restrict the commercial importation and non commercial movement of dog cat and ferret into the uk on the ground of welfare be an important objective as the bill be implement which hope it will be we must redouble our effort to bring to people attention how wrong the importation of these animal be the hon member for winchester mention campaign on social medium and he be entirely correct to do so the scale of the problem be large people be import these animal for commercial gain and it involve great deal of cruelty there have be rise in the market for pregnant dog and cat to be bring in the hon member be right to talk about the mutilation of animal people have know for decade if not long that the mutilation of animal tail docking and so on be cruel and wrong and should not be take place in this day and age it be utterly barbaric the bill be very important for public health as the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed say dog that have not be test for disease will not be able to come here and it will help to fulfil labour party manifesto pledge on animal welfare it will also improve enforcement have some experience of that from talk to former colleague and the bill will make it much easy to enforce certain element of exist animal cruelty law for example on the mutilation of dog that be very important mention have be make of dog on twitter feed during the general election campaign admit that during the campaign and for many month beforehand too have hobby of take picture of dog and post they on twitter have get out of the habit so thank the hon member for winchester for remind that it be quite pleasant thing to do it be probably well for my constituent too they probably find it much more interesting than my political comment and other interesting observation may have they may in fact come to the view that be more perceptive and expert on dog than on politic although hope they will not find that out for another five year or so as vet the hon member for winchester speak from position of real expertise he outline why the bill be important and he be to be commend for bring it to the house rise to support this vital bill and commend the hon member for winchester dr chambers for bring it to the house as all member will know animal welfare be major concern for our constituent and nowhere be that more true than bolton west the bill have be long await and be delighted that this parliament will finally deliver where previous parliaments be unable to deliver we be nation of animal lover and it should be point of pride that to reflect that we strive to have the tough animal welfare protection anywhere in the world my mailbox and postbag reflect the animal welfare concern that have and that we have hear during the debate dean constituent of mine in daisy hill email to say accord to respondent to the cats protection cats and their stats cats survey of the cat that be obtain in the month precede the survey be from abroad the importation of cat and dog with mutilation such as declaw and ear cropping lack of vaccination and health check and dangerous transport condition present significant risk to animal welfare we know that the uk biosecurity be compromise by pet smuggling give that animal may carry transmittable disease such as rabie and tapeworm which put both human and animal at risk the rise price of cat in particular pedigree mean that illegally import cat be become increasingly lucrative for criminal cats protection statistic show that of the cat obtain in the past month be pedigree for the first time more pedigree cat than moggie be acquire in month period the bill be vital opportunity to put in place the measure to tackle pet smuggling that could not complete their passage in the last parliament will my hon friend join in thank the volunteer across cats protection and at edinburgh dog and cat home for the work that they do every day to keep rescue animal safe do he agree that those charity need our help and support and that the bill will help to amplify the work that they do will also put it on the record that have two rescue animal cat and dog who both live to year of age sadly they be no long with we but for the sake of hansard want to mention their name cannie and roohi my hon friend be absolutely right to talk about the critical work of animal welfare charity across the country they can make such difference diane in ladybridge email to say this bill be major step forward in improve the life of animal she be delighted that it will make it much hard to exploit pet travel rule to illegally traffic puppy and kitten breed in horrific condition overseas into the uk she also note dog and cat involve in bad breeding whether they use for breeding or breed poorly themselves do not have fair chance in life they more likely to have health problem and poor socialisation mean they can struggle with life as pet be really pleased that the bill will finally close loophole to address the issue of dog and cat with illegal mutilation such as cropped ear or dock tail and help to bring down demand for those feature we have speak about the social medium impact it be incumbent on we as parliamentarian and figure in public life to continue to drive public awareness about why those procedure be mutilation and the adverse impact they have on the animal and frankly society as whole be really pleased that the bill will make it much hard to exploit pet travel rule to traffic illegally puppy kitten and ferret breed in horrific condition overseas into the uk sadly these activity can involve gang who be associate with serious organise crime which be personally keen on tackle during my time in parliament by bring in tough restriction we can protect animal welfare and also cut source of criminal income an issue that one way or another continue to raise in this house while cat and dog be overwhelmingly the most popular pet in this country it would be remiss of as northern mp not to reference the humble ferret mention by my hon friend the members for watford matt turmaine and for northampton south mike reader ferret be northern icon on that topic our other northern icon oasis be today reform for their first gig in year to conclude have listen to my constituent on the vital importance of protect animal welfare it be fair to say that both they and be mad fer ret congratulate the hon member for winchester dr chambers on bring forward this bill year on from the general election it be nice to have one of those day when there be sequence of bills that we can all get behind and support and that should do great good for animal in this country and hopefully for some of the human as well when give my maiden speech highlight that my predecessor and in keep with convention say something nice about he be both vegetarian and that animal welfare be cause that be close to both of our heart if we look at most of his time in office we can see his extensive effort around animal welfare my contribution have be far more limited in part because of the number of constituency issue that feel need to take priority during that time but be pleased to be here today to support this measure to improve the wellbeing of animal recall write question my predecessor ask that slightly relate to today debate and it be in relation to the importation and exportation of reindeer from the united kingdom thank to that question we be now aware that in and in there be two import of reindeer and one export of reindeer presumably santa sleigh have separate licensing arrangement in the united kingdom import control have significant role to play in my constituency crawley constituency be home to gatwick airport and its animal reception centre give people the important ability to relocate with their pet and also to bring more exotic animal into the united kingdom local authority also have significant role to play in these process during my time as councillor see number of request for permit for exotic animal result in somewhat confusing conversation about why someone really need full sized crocodile in the middle of housing estate that licence be not approve the hon member for winchester be to be commend for bring forward this bill and the house be privileged to benefit from his extensive professional experience in understand the important role that the bill will play in prevent animal abuse and hopefully enhance wide animal welfare we be nation of animal lover and we should feel proud that the legislative framework in this country be already world leading despite all the measure we have in place think member would agree give the range of correspondence we get from our constituent that there be probably more separate campaign on animal welfare than on any other policy area that have certainly be my experience it be important that we do not rest on our laurel we must accept that the job be not do and that as technology move thing forward additional measure will need to be put in place to improve animal wellbeing the issue of social medium and animal abuse online have be raise in the debate and the hon member for winchester outline the role that influencer have to play in addition there be far too many group online that be dedicate to animal abuse constituent of mine have attempt to shut down such group but rather than be support by social medium company in try to address the problem they have instead find themselves report by the perpetrator of the abuse and have face have their own account shut down and be leave without the support they need to bring the network of abuse to an end the bad example of that type of animal abuse that be aware of be bring up with in constituency surgery and they relate to the torture of baby monkey which be choose because when they be put in baby grow people can convince themselves that they be baby although that be clearly illegal already the current requirement on social medium company to act be insufficient will not burden the house by inform hon member of the thing that now know about what happen to those monkey all can say be that after my constituent leave spend some minute deal with the tear about what have happen to those monkey we must do well around this and very much hope that move forward we be able to do so enthusiastically support the bill but we can not rest on our laurel meta must be make to answer for not act to bring an end to animal abuse on its network and for its active profiting from the advertising that appear on those network advertiser must be make aware that part of what they be pay for when they advertise on facebook be the maintenance of animal abuse network hope advertiser think more carefully about that in the future be proud to speak in this debate as the member of parliament for portsmouth north seat do not hold this time last year but proudly hold today although technically not for year until

bill strengthen police power so that they can do their job more effectively specifically it give the police power of entry and allow they to seize and detain dog and to collect evidence change that farmer in my constituency have specifically tell be necessary the bill will also increase the penalty and we hope in turn the deterrent against livestock worry the fine be currently cap at maximum of that will go up to an unlimited amount to reflect the severity of livestock worry from an animal welfare standpoint as well as the economic toll an attack can have on farming farming have diversify and therefore the scope of livestock require protection have increase be delighted that camelid such as alpaca and llamas will now be protect under the bill anyone who have drive down country road such as those in my constituency of chester south and eddisbury will know that farmer move livestock in recognition of that the bill include road and path as location where an offence may take place

aphra brandreth say it be fantastic to see this legislation bring in by party that be not in government with cross party support declare that be member of the national farmers union food and farming fellowship have be fortunate to visit number of farm across the uk to hear at first hand from farmer from range of speciality can say that the bill will be fully support across that community particularly in northamptonshire the nfu do great work to represent our fantastic farmer number of whom meet yesterday at food event in northampton as we launch the northamptonshire good food plan they speak of the challenge particularly of work across border with the police because their farm often do not fit within normal police boundary and say they want more government support for the rural economy the bill go some way to help to achieve that be really pleased to see the expansion of the definition in the bill and commend the hon member for chester south and eddisbury and the bill committee for ensure that we get that right in particular the inclusion of alpacas and llamas be really positive as we be see more and more of they rear in northamptonshire it will be positive to continue to review that as farmer diversify into new way of maintain food supply and the environment and ensure the long term sustainability of farming bill such as this should continue to be adapt and evolve through successive government meet farming colleague relatively recently who tell about mauling incident that happen on his land it be shocking to hear about the direct impact on he and his staff who discover it and the fact that the police struggle to take action because of the lack of power to undertake thing such as forensic it be positive that the bill be increase the relevant power particularly on the capture of dna from dog to ensure that perpetrator can be bring to justice it be grim thing that continue to happen year on year and we must take positive step to change it the bill be also very well time in northamptonshire the new police fire and crime commissioner danielle stone have recognise that rural crime have be neglect in recent year she have launch rural crime survey and have number of roundtable and panel with farmer across the county we now see farming and the protection of rural community front and centre in her police action plan northamptonshire be home to the large town in the uk northampton but also acre and acre of beautiful countryside which be use for both arable farming and rear herd and grow crop it be great timing to see the bill come through before the summer not just my police fire and crime commissioner but police commissioner across england will recognise and support the bill as positive step forward when read the bill and listen to some of the observation in committee find the expansion of the provision to road and path quite interesting for the record my uncle be the former president of the ramblers association and he repeatedly remind of the right to roam campaign whenever see he at family do it be positive that the bill expand the definition to include road and path because it set clear requirement when someone access land particularly in somewhere like northamptonshire where so many public footpath run through farmland to protect farmer and set clear boundary for those walk their dog or undertake more nefarious activity it be also positive to see the recovery of cost in the bill that be big step forward that will deter people and serve as reminder to many people who may be impact by the bill overall the bill take really responsible and balanced approach and commend the hon member for chester south and eddisbury on her work as we have hear today from the many dog owner in the chamber dog owner be generally responsible but when thing go wrong and someone do not take that responsibility seriously there must be measure in place for the police to step in and farmer to be protect so be really pleased to see this bill it do not take heavy handed approach as couple of constituent have write to about it strike the right balance and fully commend it and thank the hon member for bring it forward thank the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth for bring forward this bill which be immensely popular with local farmer have meet with the nfu and its membership repeatedly over month if not most of the last year and it be always one of the first thing they mention to commend she for her sterling work and for the collegiate way in which she always conduct herself include in this matter it be fantastic that we be extend protection to alpaca and llamas no one want to see attack or worrying and include both those definition be really important and strengthen the law appropriately be incredibly impressed that the bill cover path and road the hon member for chester south and eddisbury think her constituency be the most beautiful in the country but of course it be not even the most beautiful in cheshire because mine be well one of the really beautiful thing do recently be go to goostrey rose festival last weekend we have new path in goostrey and they be use incredibly regularly by dog walker but they be on farm boundary this legislation be so important for cover path like those have be on farm with family in the aftermath of dog attack and it be terrible be not here to demonise dog owner we have so many considerate sensible countryside love dog owner in my constituency and know the hon member for chester south and eddisbury be not either we be here to make sure that the overwhelming majority of people be leave in peace to go about their everyday life in both the farming community and the dog own community they be often one and the same and to make sure that rural crime be properly prosecute gps theft be another major component of rural crime in my area our local police and crime commissioner dan price have be do work on this and the hon member for chester south and eddisbury have be involve in it it would be great to get an update from the minister on that want to take moment to thank the nfu which have lobby extensively on this issue be on its food and farming fellowship and have learn great deal from it also thank the farmer in my constituency for continue to feed we and for look after the countryside so well rise to support the bill and commend the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth for bring it to parliament want to make some brief remark about what be sometimes perceive as tension between those who wish to responsibly enjoy the countryside and both the economic toll and the harm do to livestock by livestock worry since be elect to this place have be strong champion for expand responsible access to the countryside across england and wales my hon friend the member for northampton south mike reader mention the right to roam campaign commend the hon member for chester south and eddisbury because this bill shin light on the fact that most of we who wish to go into the great outdoors and enjoy our wonderful countryside whether that be in cheshire or on the wonderful west pennine moor in my bolton west constituency do so responsibly but those who do not ensure that their dog conduct themselves in considerate manner will feel the wrath of these measure particularly welcome that because there be balance to be strike between farmer and those who look after livestock in the countryside and those who want to enjoy our great outdoors with that in mind want to touch on couple of point on extend the provision to include camelid there be number of alpaca and llama at farm in my constituency include smithills open farm member may think they look rather incongruous on the great west pennine moor but assure they that they be incredibly popular both in term of the opportunity to walk they around the moor and with school visit want to touch on couple of point that the minister may pick up on relate to the opportunity that present themselves outside the criminal law to push for great responsible enjoyment of our countryside particularly in respect of increase investment in promote awareness of the countryside code will read out some of the provision in the code to make people aware think they be principle that everyone in this place can rally around do not feed livestock horse or wild animal do not cause damage or disturbance leave no trace always keep dog under control and in sight dog poo bag it and bin it take your litter home and most importantly be courteous be nice share the space with other that should be the golden thread that run through all our time spend in the countryside it be worth put on the record that the uk rank the low of european nation with regard to nature connectedness and out european nation survey the uk be in term of physical activity so there be great work to be do to provide access to nature but also on enjoy it and break down some of the barrier to opportunity nevertheless commend the hon member for chester south and eddisbury for bring forward the bill very much appreciate the concern she have raise around livestock worry she have be champion for that cause ever since she get elect to this place commend the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy for praise her daughter in the chamber it be very important to praise child my aunty mary who move from newcastle in the blitz to become schoolteacher just north of here in london would always emphasise to how important it be to give child confidence in their ability and their quality we be talk early about dog and david hockney so it would be remiss of not to mention elizabeth blackadder very fine printmaker from glasgow and one of the united kingdom most famous artist she be real pioneer in revive printmaking in scotland in trongate we have the glasgow print studio project ability currently have an exhibition of art by people who have disability and mental health issue it be wonderful exhibition if any member be go to glasgow they should go to that exhibition because it be absolutely wonderful it be beautiful exhibition the bill do not apply to scotland because it be criminal matter and criminal matter be devolve to scotland in the constitutional settlement but this be an important issue in scotland there have be some discussion about the lack of prosecution for this sort of offence it be important that these offence be prosecute because farming be an important part of the british economy and the scottish economy know that well because as complete townie who get very uncomfortable if there be lack of car and noise marry into family of farmer my wife family be dairy farmer on the solway firth which look over into cumbria where the bill will apply and have very important impact as sheep farming be very important in cumbria do not think my lovely father in law andrew be particularly impressed with my farming ability help in the milk parlour do not go very well and apparently the fence put up be not straight enough he generally think be incompetent in the farming area think now after year of marriage it be come up to our wedding anniversary on july he think be kind of all right as husband and father but have not check this week my wife aunt and uncle elma and sam be sheep farmer sheep farming be very difficult way of make money it be hard work farming be hard hard work whatever kind it be farmer have to get up very early to look after the animal they have to protect the animal and pay for the veterinary bill and so on it be tough job do not think we should underestimate how important this bill will be as signal that this house support farmer and take into account their concern these be hard job farmer be steward of the countryside across britain obviously glasgow be the most beautiful place in the world but would not wish to get into dispute about where the most beautiful part of cheshire be because cheshire be beautiful farmer be an important part of stewarde the countryside across our family of nation which be so important to we and this bill be important for farmer farmer be important for the british economy not just the farm themselves but our brilliant farmer who help to supply restaurant and shop create the great revival of british cooking and cuisine that we have see in our lifetime so this bill be very important and hope that the scottish government look at it carefully and perhaps review the lack of prosecution of these offence now should say something of the bill itself because it be important have cover the important constitutional aspect of it that it do not cover scotland but clause be key there be limited scope for the police to seize dog for prolonged period of time even when they be cause danger it be be afraid regrettably common for dog that have be seize to carry out further attack pende the trial of their owner give the police the ability to seize dog for long period of time will therefore prevent those repeat attack commend the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth for address that in clause it be an important provision and she be quite right to include it as recover lawyer have at time have an interest in the investigation of crime of course whatever the legal system it be necessary to have sufficient evidence broadly to convince judge or jury to convict someone rural crime be particularly difficult in that regard the reason be self evident when we think about it as complete townie it have take bit of time to spot the self evidence of it my hon friend consistently refer to himself as complete townie description that would apply to myself too of course the fact that we reside in urban area do not in any way mean that we be unconcerned by the fortune of our fellow parliamentarian who represent agricultural area or indeed their community who play vital role in sustain we the importance of food be something often speak about for as much as we focus on whatever the lead industry be of the day society fundamentally come down to the question of whether we can feed and house ourselves covid in particular drive forward the point that the agricultural system in this country be vital my hon friend intervention typify his many thoughtful contribution he make an important point think all of we who live in city towny like have great yearning for the countryside in my constituency we have tollcross park which be wonderful park recommend that everyone visit it there be city farm in the park which house llamas and alpaca to which the provision of the bill extend they be protect by it would not want to sully this debate with political point but simply point out that the snp council regularly threaten to close that farm tollcross also have some wonderful rose garden which the council do not look after particularly well which be real disappointment to my constituent they be right to be disappoint turn back to the bill the investigation of crime in the countryside be difficult as there be not lot of people about there be no cctv and there be very few witness if any clause allow for the collection of forensic evidence which will be very important in link the dog to the animal that have be attack and the owner and in facilitate the prosecution of these serious crime and bring about justice it be fair to say that my hon friend the member for crawley peter lamb raise very important issue the improved power of entry and search in order to look for sample and take impression from dog teeth impression and so on assume be very important too again they make investigation of these crime easy it be important that we investigate and prosecute the crime if we do not the law will just sit on the statute book unenforce ignore and otiose if we do not have the enforcement mechanism we be waste our time in the house so the hon member for chester south and eddisbury be right to include they in the bill we do not want to waste our time everyone in this house agree that crack down on these terrible crime be very important be particularly pleased that the bill deal with road and path have help my father in law on many occasion utterly incompetently with thing like move animal around somewhat like my career in the petrochemical industry when put diesel in the unleaded car it be not something be cut out for know that animal can be attack and worry on road and path it be also right that attack livestock be deal with differently from worry livestock have probably say enough about the bill but let say finally that be pleased that camelid be to be protect by it llamas and alpaca be beautiful animal as mention we have they in the tollcross city farm they be well worth visit the bill recognise innovation in britain agricultural sector as it look to move to new product of course alpaca and llama be not just important as animal but good source of very fine wool for clothe anyone who have be to peru will probably have be approach on number of occasion to buy an alpaca jumper they have lovely soft wool it be important that we extend these protection to that important innovation in the farming industry can not speak highly enough of the bill or of the hon member for chester south and eddisbury for bring such an excellent well draft piece of legislation to the house like everyone who have speak so far congratulate the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth much like the constituency of my hon friend the member for glasgow east john grady crawley be an urban constituency on the plus side suppose that mean get to avoid the bunfight over who have the good rural constituency we undoubtedly have the great urban constituency we be not necessarily know for our farm in crawley we have fairly tight boundary around the town but people be often surprised to find that we do have they because the safeguard land between the urban area of the town and the airport be currently only usable as agricultural land we be not allow to build anything else there need to take that up with ministers in due course in order to try to release it for much need economic and housing space do my hon friend agree that it be vital to have farm in build up setting in order to give connection to people who perhaps do not have the good fortune of be able to get out into the countryside to enable they to understand how crucial farming be to this country and also frankly so that they may enjoy livestock in responsible manner agree with my hon friend have any form of green space in close proximity be vital psychologically we will be discuss the space industry soon and research undertake by those in the space industry show the huge psychological boost that people get from be close to green space it be worth bear in mind that farming be not necessarily the good representation of natural england when we in this place talk about housing development worry because all too often people become obsess with the notion that england be suppose to be land of roll green field the reality be that this country be densely forest and substantial amount of biodiversity have be remove to make viable area that be now open green field in the government housing programme we should look at such area as brownfield land on the basis that they be not what natural england be suppose to look like in many case new housing development will have great level of biodiversity none the less integrate farming alongside other form of industry be an important part of develop well rounded community be familiar with such farm in part because when be member of west sussex county council many year ago not enough year ago give my experience of be county councillor we buy one of those farm it be view as fantastic idea on the basis that the land would in due course be develop into runway and we would make an absolute killing out of it regret to say that even if the development consent order come through right now it would still be farmland and it be not the site of the propose runway that be another of the county investment that have not really play out as plan the national wealth fund which the government be focus on building to be fair on work do by the previous administration have real focus on help local authority to make sensible investment do my hon friend agree that give the various saga that we have see thurrock and solar for example or interest rate swap by hammersmith and fulham back in the day that be very sensible objective for the national wealth fund order the hon member for crawley peter lamb will be sure be speak to the dogs protection of livestock amendment bill be fight my way back to it madam deputy speaker just to address my hon friend point have be local authority leader for quite some time understand the pressure on council to make such investment if their income be be reduce in other way clearly however many lesson have have to be learn hope that the fund will provide opportunity to use public money far well if member will please allow to get back to the substance of the bill will proceed with all due haste my constituency be surround by field and consequently the provision that affect those area also affect my constituent we have livestock in the constituency particularly in the nature centre in one of the town main park it have just be rebrande as tilgate zoo but for long time it be the nature and rare breed centre where have spend many happy hour in various capacity it be where get marry that be high point it be where be bite by turkey at the age of two that be low point be sure it all balance out in the long run be afraid we do not have any alpaca or llama although would love we to get some we be suppose to be roll out different country exhibit as time go on be remind that alpaca and llama be no laugh matter the inca empire never develop the wheel the entire empire be build off the back of alpaca and llamas as such they be worthy of great respect what we do have however be sheep and cow but some pretty harrowing thing happen to the livestock at the nature centre in one case sheep be set on fire while it be still alive although the bill do not directly deal with that the mentality behind the disrespect of such animal be worthy of note far more often dog have be set on the animal or at least people have not be in control of their dog we eventually have to remove the sheep entirely from the publicly accessible area in fact we go bit far than that because the local authority own the park we also have problem around the main lake where we keep find that cygnet and baby duckling be be maul by dog that have come off leash we take the decision to implement public space protection order mandate all dog owner to keep their dog on lead in those area to try to reduce the risk to other animal will be honest and say that it be not well receive we be re consult on it now but suspect it probably still will not be desperately well receive the big problem around these issue be that people love their dog and they think their dog could never possibly do anything wrong be certain that they be right about that in the overwhelming majority of case but there will always be situation where an owner will not be in control something will happen and other pay the price people be put at risk or we lose animal despite have voluntary provision in these area experience show that these be insufficient to the task of require people to keep their dog under control the provision need to cover all the case they can not just deal with the odd exception it be really important that the bill put in place provision to enable the police to take appropriate action to monitor investigate and resolve situation where livestock have be affect but it be not just about put provision in place we have habit sometimes of produce regulation but not allocate resource and if we do not allocate the resource we do not actually produce any well outcome big concern of mine be that if we create law that we do not then enforce we encourage lawlessness in the long run we should have sufficient regulation that we be capable of enforce and be prepared to enforce in order to maintain the value and meaning of the law to our constituent this issue be not just about animal welfare while it be tragic when incident occur than affect livestock it be fundamentally matter of economic as well the point make to my hon friend the member for glasgow east this be an industry these be people livelihood and as we be well aware from debate in this place over the last year they operate on extremely tight margin and these people can not afford the kind of loss that this abuse can cause it be important that there be system of regulation in place to enable the industry to operate effectively into the future because this be not simply about what happen to the industry agriculture be matter of national security for all of we as an island we have have to learn this lesson many time as country we have always have to import some food from overseas and there have always be trade as far back as the neolithic age we import certain amount of herring from scandinavia we see very clearly in world war two the impact on society as whole when boat be able to disrupt the trade system with the empire and convoy and sailor have to put their life at risk to ensure that people would survive this country make effort at the time with campaign encourage people to grown their own food and effort have be make since to try to create large enough agricultural sector in the united kingdom so that we will always be able to feed our population the development of buffer stock system over the war ensure that market fluctuation do not drive people out of business and they continue to operate on some level to this day the impact on our national security be drive home to we during covid when those who be work throughout the food distribution sector be designate as key worker it be regrettable that we as society have row back from realise that people in these logistical and retail role play far more fundamental role in our day to day ability to survive than many of the role that we choose to promote in society ultimately we need law that be go to support those in this industry to thrive in summary agree with the proposal in the bill and have attempt to get through my speech at the fast possible pace to make that point call the shadow minister thank my hon friend the member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth for introduce the bill which have enjoy wide support from member across the house the hon member for northampton south mike reader remind we of the need to keep control of dog on path and country lane the hon member for congleton sarah russell stress the importance of these improve protection for her farmer as they be for farmer in somerset the hon member for bolton west phil brickell emphasise the need for responsible access to the countryside about which agree the hon member for glasgow east john grady tell we about the need for strengthen police power the hon member for crawley peter lamb take we on gentle country ramble in his speech and tell we that his constituency be entirely urban and he know little of farming let tell he not to worry because he be clearly eminently qualified to be labour next secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs he could scarcely know less or do bad than the current incumbent pay tribute to those group that have long champion this reform they include the national sheep association the rspca the british veterinary association the national farmers union and the all party parliamentary group for animal welfare as have already mention once today britain be nation of animal lover and the conservatives be proud of our record in government of far improve britain world lead position on animal welfare this bill follow in that proud tradition because livestock worry be blight on our countryside and blight on our farmer in recent survey by the national sheep association of respondent say they have experience dog attack on their livestock in the past month one in of those respondent say that they have experience between and such attack which be truly appalling these attack cause distress and injury to livestock and in the most extreme case they can cause the death of animal that be not only traumatic for farmer but it can be expensive too nfu mutual datum show that insurance claim for dog attack on farm animal exceed million in farmer have enough to worry about with this government new family farm tax without the additional burden of attack on their livestock by dog the bill make several improvement to exist law first it introduce vital distinction between livestock worry and attack this change will help to strengthen enforcement where serious harm have occur clause expand police power to seize dog they reasonably expect to have be involve in such offence this important amendment help to close exist legal loophole and ensure swift police action to prevent further harm clause empower police and veterinary professional to take sample or impression from wounded animal or suspect dog to aid criminal investigation this change will make it significantly easy to gather evidence and bring charge the national farmers union have rightly champion the measure note that many livestock worrying incident go unreported due to lack of confidence in enforcement the possibility of use dna testing could be game changer for successful prosecution and urge the government to support further research and work with police force to implement the result clause allow officer with warrant to search property for dog believe to be involve in an attack this be crucial power to ensure justice be serve and will help end the widespread perception among farmer that little can be do once an attack occur another major improvement be the inclusion of road and public path within the legislation scope livestock be often move between field use country lane under current rule if an animal be attack outside field the burden unfairly fall on the farmer this bill correct that and rightly place responsibility on dog owner to always control their pet near livestock the bill broaden the definition of livestock to include camelid such as alpaca and llamas which be increasingly part of rural enterprise particularly welcome that clause especially on behalf of establishment such as the animal farm adventure park in berrow in my constituency the bill introduce many essential enforcement power that will allow our police to crack down on worry but we must not forget about prevention responsible dog ownership be key the previous government working group bring together police stakeholder and welfare organisation to improve education on how to keep pet and livestock safe in wales drop in livestock worrying incident between and have be credit to outreach campaign dog training course and effective rural crime team we must continue to amplify educational message such as those in the country code call on the government to make sure they continue that vital work and to look at how we might far encourage responsible dog ownership my constituency have large farming community and have see at first hand the impact of livestock worry on my constituent recently meet austen lockyer who farm in my constituency he tell that he struggle when irresponsible owner allow their dog off lead on public footpath through his field treat they like recreation ground and worry his sheep know the bill will be comfort to he and those like he and that we be act to shift the burden of responsibility to dog owner be pleased to have support the bill since it be introduce and through committee and it be pleasure to stand at the dispatch box and confirm that the opposition support the bill in full urge colleague from all party to support the bill and to bring an end to the scourge of livestock worry in rural community it be privilege to speak on third reading express my gratitude to the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth for take the bill through the house really be not go to get party political on this day of unity when we be all in so much agreement however the shadow minister the hon member for bridgwater sir ashley fox have prompt to do so and who be to turn away such an invitation it be marvellous that he think the bill be such good idea and that he be fully supportive of it say gently to he that his party have year in which to support bills like this and the animal welfare import of dogs cats and ferrets bill that we debate early it be quite interesting to hear he try to defend the previous government record at defra we all know that every single river lake and sea be fill with sewage be more than happy to discuss the record of the previous government will return to my tone of unity thank everyone who contribute to get the bill to third reading and everyone who be involve in committee have be brief on how much support the bill be show in committee so thank all member from across the house for their work in that thank the hon member for northampton south mike reader for mention his membership of the nfu food and farming fellowship and the support of the nfu completely agree with he on the difference that capture dog dna will make to enforcement it be important that that be adopt and develop be tempt back into get political again agree with my hon friend that rural crime be neglect for year under the previous government but we be start to take it more seriously thank my hon friend the member for congleton sarah russell for engage frequently with the nfu and represent its view as well as those of farmer across her constituency agree with she that it be important that the bill cover path and road as well will not get involve in the debate on which be the most beautiful constituency how could madam deputy speaker when you and know that yorkshire be god own country thank my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell for talk about responsible access to the countryside when we enjoy the beauty of nature it be crucial that we all obey the countryside code hope that all member promote the code across their constituency my hon friend also mention the bagging and binning of dog poo that remind of when attend the filey folk festival and one of the most amusing song have hear for long time which be about the dog poo tree the song be dedicate to all those people who go on walk collect their dog poo in dog poo bag and then hang the bag on the dog poo tree at the end of the walk it remind we all to not just bag it but take it away with we on that point go to the hardingstone village fair this weekend have pop up surgery want to thank the constituent who come to tell about the dog poo epidemic in hardingstone she ask what the government go to do to help confirm that we will make sure that council have the power to address this issue and that will raise it with west northamptonshire council to make sure that it take action it be clearly impact resident in the village of hardingstone completely agree that it be incredibly unpleasant as always it be only minority of people who fail to take away their dog poo be grateful to my hon friend the member for glasgow east john grady for the tip on visit the beautiful print art in glasgow hope that his father in law be impress by his support for this bill if not by his ability as farmer congratulate my hon friend on his wedding anniversary on july my hon friend the member for crawley peter lamb talk about the psychological boost that we get when we be near nature he be completely right it be such positive feeling to be out in the wild always talk to my local yorkshire wildlife group about the importance of tangle where some people see mess other see biodiversity and nature we get the most nature where there be tangle of different plant grow we get very little on mowed lawn we get nature where we see weed different habitat and different area for specie to grow and develop be convinced that this be reason not to do as much gardening we be then support biodiversity and the need for tangle member have also mention the importance of plant more forest and talk about how we can raise the amount of biodiversity on our new estate all of which completely agree with the minister mention forest want to congratulate trees for congleton which have just plant its tree in congleton it set out few year ago to plant one tree for every citizen in the town and it have achieve that think that be quite remarkable be delighted to join my hon friend in congratulate trees for congleton thirty thousand tree be an incredible achievement and let we hope it keep go the number of livestock keep in the uk have nearly double since the dogs protection of livestock act be pass and there have be large increase in dog ownership the national sheep association survey indicate that of respondent have experience between one and incident of sheep worry in the last month that highlight the urgent need to modernise the legislation in order to address this issue on average respondent report four sheep death per year due to sheep worry by dog an increase on previous year and one respondent report sheep kill in single attack these figure do not account for miscarriage of lamb or for the other secondary impact of livestock worry the behaviour of dog that chase attack or cause distress to livestock can have devastating outcome and result in injury or death which can have detrimental impact on farmer livestock worry can also have wide implication such as lamb be aborted and flock of bird be smother that demonstrate how harmful such incident can be it be clear that we need strong measure to attack livestock worrying and the devastating effect on farmer and livestock and this bill will deliver these measure the government recognise the distress that livestock worrying can cause animal and their keeper all report crime must be take seriously investigate and where appropriate take through the court so that perpetrator receive the appropriate penalty this bill amend the dogs protection of livestock act which underpin livestock worry offence and enforcement and will summarise the three main area that the bill will address before go into more detail on the measure the bill will primarily focus on three area it will modernise the definition and scope of the livestock worry offence by extend the location where an offence may take place to include road and path and it will expand the species scope to include camelid which be commonly find it will strengthen police power include power of entry the seizure and detention of dog and the collection of evidence to improve enforcement and as deterrent it will increase the maximum penalty from fine of to an unlimited fine those three key area will strengthen the legislation and deterrence around livestock worrying and attack on livestock the bill will broaden the location where an offence may take place to include road and path dog and dog walker be commonly find walk on road and path and this new measure will help to protect livestock when they be be move for instance cow go into milk parlour or sheep be move across the field that be an important new protection the bill will extend the specie protect by the act to include camelid such as llamas and alpaca the british alpaca society estimate that there might be as many as alpaca own by member in england and further own by non member the bill will also amend the wording of the offence of livestock worry so that attack livestock be deal with separately from worry livestock attack be part of what be more widely describe as worry in the act however the term worry can dismiss the severity of some offence reframe the act so that attack be distinct from worry well highlight the violent nature of incident involve attack on livestock the new police power will be huge help to the police the primary focus of the bill be to strengthen those power to enable the police to respond to livestock worry incident more effectively they include extend power of seizure modify entry power and introduce new power to take sample and impression from livestock and suspect dog furthermore in survey carry out by the national sheep association in of respondent agree that there be an urgent need for additional police power it be generally unheard of to get of people to agree on something the police can currently only seize dog find or suspect to have worry livestock for the purpose of identify the owner the police have limit power at their disposal to address reoffende when the same dog be find attack livestock repeatedly or the same owner have several dog that worry livestock under this bill if the police have reasonable ground to believe that there be risk that the dog could attack or worry livestock again they have the power to seize and detain the dog the dog can be detain until an investigation have be carry out or if proceeding be bring for an offence until those proceeding have be determine or withdraw we hope this power will address the issue of reoffende and dog owner who disregard the law and will help to address the most serious instance of livestock worry the bill will also introduce power to enable the police to take sample and impression from dog or livestock where they have reasonable ground to believe that the dog have attack or worry the livestock and that sample or impression might provide evidence of an offence the sample or impression could then be use as evidence to support prosecution sample may be retain until either the police investigation into potential offence have finish or court proceeding have finish or be withdraw finally the bill will extend the power of entry under current legislation the police can enter premise only for the purpose of identify the dog owner the reason for extend the power of entry in relation to this offence be to ensure that the police can collect the necessary evidence to prosecute these crime the bill will extend police power to allow the police to enter and search premise with warrant to seize and take sample from dog if there be reasonable ground to believe that an offence have be commit the expand power of entry will allow the police to seize item that may be evidence of an offence for example dog collar or towel with blood on it these power be important for improve the conviction rate and reduce the prevalence of reoffende so that we protect our respected farmer from the horrific consequence of livestock worry in the light of our improvement to enforcement mechanism to allow the police to deal with and investigate incident of livestock worry more effectively we hope that livestock owner or bystander will feel encouraged to report more incident and will know that the report will be take seriously the bill will also increase penalty the penalty be currently set at maximum fine of the maximum penalty will be increase to an unlimited fine to act as deterrent the court will determine an appropriate fine amount in line with sentencing guideline that take into account the seriousness of the offence and the financial circumstance of the offender the court can already impose compensation order on an offender require they to make financial reparation to the victim for any personal injury loss or damage result from an offence compensation may be order for such an amount as the court consider appropriate have regard to any evidence include any representation make by the offender or prosecutor there be no limit on the value of single compensation order hand down to an offender and the bill will not change that survey carry out by the national farmers union in find that in england the midland be the worst hit region by cost with dog attack on livestock cost an estimate it be follow by the south east where the cost be an estimate farm animal in the south east of england worth an estimated be severely injure or kill in dog attack in that be up on the previous year furthermore the national sheep association find that more than half of all respondent feel that increase fine punishment and seizure power would reduce sheep worry incident of course many responsible dog walker enjoy the countryside without incident dog owner have responsibility to ensure that their dog be keep safe and under control the countryside code highlight that it be good practice to keep dog on lead around livestock it say that visitor should always check local sign as there be location where they must keep their dog on lead for part or all of the year we recognise that there be careful balance to be strike between protect the wide public and their livestock from dog attack the freedom that people enjoy when they be walk their dog and of course the welfare of those dog include their freedom to exhibit normal behaviour the new police power that the bill will introduce will ensure an effective response to report case they be vital measure that will help improve enforcement and protect the livelihood of our valuable farming community countryside access come up the bill would cover scenario in which the person in charge of the dog cause it to attack livestock that have stray on to road or path the act protect livestock that may have stray from one field to another if it be agricultural land as define in the act subject to certain exemption and offence the countryside code encourage people to check local sign and leave gate as they find they the public right of way guidance highlight the responsibility of landowner regard waymarke and sign include the responsibility to use sign to warn people of danger that be not obvious the welfare of livestock be the responsibility of the owner and they must take necessary measure to protect their livestock owner of livestock should of course take reasonable care to see that their livestock do not stray there be common law duty on anyone who keep animal in field next to road to take reasonable care to prevent their escape in order to avoid damage this private member bill focus on deliver the great impact by improve the police power to investigate and support conviction let say in answer to question ask that it will not be an offence to fail to report an incident we would always encourage dog walker to be responsible in such circumstance by bring an incident to the attention of the livestock owner and the police so that the owner can ensure that the injure livestock can receive the care or treatment they need that be important for welfare reason it would be difficult to enforce legal reporting requirement on other specie be protect sheep be specifically protect from dog at large because they be most susceptible to distress in the presence of dog and be prone to abort their young when distressed primary legislation could be consider in future to add other specie if necessary that point be raise by one of my hon friend the countryside code highlight that it be good practice to keep dog on lead around livestock and we would encourage this practice to ensure that dog and walker be keep safe it be important to note that the bill will not amend section of the act which set out an exemption to section for guide dog owner of guide dog will remain exempt from criminal liability if their guide dog be at large in field or enclosure where there be sheep however the offence of chase or attack livestock apply to guide dog and the owner of the guide dog would be commit an offence if the dog chase or attack livestock ultimately it remain for the court to decide what can be consider guide dog recognise the strong public support for animal welfare in this country as reflect in the volume of correspondence receive by my department and the sustained engagement from stakeholder key stakeholder include the livestock and farming sector the animal welfare sector the police and the veterinary sector have be engage in respect of these measure apologise to the bill promoter the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth for be late

bridget yes agree there have be support from the scottish government and we have be work in co operation how the bill will be implement by the scottish government be core part of the amendment without

amendment seek to remedy that oversight and ensure that the scottish government be able to implement the bill in their own devolve legislation so that scottish elector may benefit in time for the may scottish parliament election it be unfortunate to need to make technical amendment this late in the process of parliamentary scrutiny particularly give that the error could have be identify some time ago but be glad to be able to assist the scottish government with this matter commend the amendment to the house congratulate my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert on

election elector in england be also give the option to use the online service to apply for postal or proxy vote for all other type of election that they can participate in unfortunately the same can not be say for voter in scotland and wales as it stand voter in scotland and wales face fragmented system in which they may apply online for postal or proxy vote for uk general election but still rely on fill out paper form for their local council or devolve parliament election the bill enable that inconsistency to be end in short the bill will allow for the extension of the same online application option to voter in scotland and wales for devolved election the goal be to have the measure in place ahead of the devolve election schedule for may have emphasise this before but again stress the importance of devolution the responsibility for local election and election to the scottish parliament and senedd cymru be rightfully devolve to the respective nation the bill have be draft to ensure that devolution be respect with the proposal have be discuss with ministers from both the scottish and welsh governments alongside support from those government the bill have enjoy cross party support

that the voting rule be harmonise will she outline how that benefit voter at eastbank primary school and eastbank academy in shettleston in my wonderful seat would imagine it mean they will get an extra day off school for the election which most kid enjoy the bill enhance democracy last year when the general election be call it be quite tricky for scottish voter because there be tight time window the bill will allow people to apply more easily for access to ballot if they be go to be away on holiday it have also be welcome by the electoral sector which recognise the benefit of expand streamlined and secure system this be testament to what can be achieve when we work collaboratively across government and party in the interest of democratic participation as my hon friend the member for glasgow east john grady mention hope the bill will proceed through this house and swiftly move to the other place and urge member to support its passage today congratulate my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert on get this bill to its third reading and get both side of the house behind it although note that there be no snp members in the chamber be proud member for an english constituency but we in newcastle under lyme have see the benefit of system that defend and support the franchise and ensure that people be able to have their say as such want to gently contribute to this debate to give my support to my hon friend and encourage colleague to get behind the bill democracy be important it be so important that we discuss the bill ensure that people up and down the united kingdom include in wales and scotland be able to hold their elect politician to account to ensure that their decision reflect their view we do so on the first anniversary of this labour government that speak very much to the power of the vote the bill be about ensure that people have as much support as possible to vote to have their say to shape the future and as say to hold their elect representative to account at local and devolved level in scotland and wales use to work for welsh mp and live in scotland and also work for scottish mp before my election to this house so well recall the challenge and experience my hon friend be the member of parliament for the wonderful place of newcastle under lyme do he agree that the purpose of the bill be to bring some much need consistency to vote arrangement across our family of nation voter in newcastle under lyme newcastle upon tyne or the wonderful newcastleton in scottish borders should all be able to vote in reasonably consistent way my hon friend make an important point be an english mp we be talk about scotland and wales and my wife be from northern ireland our four nation be very much represent in my short contribution to this debate have see personally the ease of the postal and proxy vote system love to vote in person but those in the west midland labour party be hard taskmaster and encourage we to vote by post so that we can be knock on door see my hon friend the minister beat torys where and when we can however make it easy to vote for people who have health or family issue or who be call away for work and the rest be vital we have see the consequence the threat to our democracy of people not think that politic represent they and their issue and do not involve or include they we must think about what we can do to neutralise those concern and those fear as my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert have do so brilliantly in her bill notwithstanding her technical amendment which be support by the house it speak for itself be grateful to you for call madam deputy speaker be here to support my hon friend before get the train home and look forward to the bill successfully pass its third reading commend my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert for bring forward the bill which rise to support it seek not only to modernise our democratic process but to safeguard the right of every citizen across the devolved nation of the uk at its heart the bill be about strengthen participation and ensure that no one be leave without voice in our democratic institution in particular it seek to streamline and clarify the mechanism for absentee voting by post or by proxy in the scottish parliament and in the senedd cymru election to align they more effectively with the broad uk framework while respect the integrity of the devolved power the right to vote be the bedrock of our democracy but right be meaningful only if it can be exercise in practice too many voter across scotland and wales especially those in rural area student those with disability and military personnel have face avoidable barrier to postal or proxy voting inconsistent regulation and outdated application process have lead to confusion and delay and the result be that people be prevent from participate in our democracy they may be serve overseas or temporarily relocate for work or on caring duty for love one play vital part in our society or our economy yet they be penalise for it by be unable to vote the bill reform be sensible and pragmatic and aim to standardise the application procedure for such vote improve the accessibility and transparency of the system but keep it inclusive and fair be well assure that in do so the bill do not seek to override or diminish the autonomy of the scottish parliament or senedd cymru but rather offer legislative framework that can be adopt in co operation with they it should be see as an opportunity for collaboration chance for all corner of the uk to work together to improve the democratic process for every voter voter in aberdeen should have exactly the same confidence in the integrity and accessibility of their vote as my constituent in aylesbury have uniformity strengthen rather than weaken our union and our democracy want to make wide point about the context we have see decline in voter turnout in recent year especially among young and transient population think that stem from the wide challenge that we have in society of young people and people more broadly feel bit disillusioned and disengage from politic my hon friend mention the lack of enthusiasm for vote among some young people that be real problem in scotland do she agree that one potential explanation be the catastrophic decline of education standard the insolvency of university in scotland and so forth that may be contribute to decline in voter enthusiasm agree the education system play big part thank my hon friend for make that point which bring to related point recently run work experience programme for fantastic group of to year old in aylesbury and ask the student to come up with idea for what more the government could do for young people in this country one group come straight to this point of politic democracy and law thank the young people in that group ruqaiya begum jacob mcnorton munashe ndoro georgia bolland and alex foster for their suggestion their ask of the government be that we give the school curriculum much great focus on voting system political awareness civic engagement the rule of law and human right they be spot on and we have great discussion about how that should help to increase understanding engagement and participation in our democracy share my hope that our manifesto commitment to lower the voting age from to in general election will help to do just that really hope that we as government will take that forward as quickly as possible thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert for bring forward this important change do my hon friend the member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith agree that we need to continue to have the conversation about what democracy mean to people and that create consistency in the voting system aid that conversation do agree it be exactly that if we be go to rebuild trust in democracy that have to start with election and with voting system that people have faith in we have discuss the urgent need to rebuild engagement and trust in our democracy that be fundamental and the bill which will make absent voting more user friendly and dependable be really important concrete step forward urge colleague across the house regardless of which party or region they represent to support it and help to ensure that no voter anywhere in the uk be absent from participate in our democracy simply because they be absent on polling day thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert for introduce the bill and welcome the opportunity to raise issue of fairness and equality in the uk democracy we have see in england that absent voting by post or proxy have empower thousand of people to make their voice hear even when life get in the way whether in the form of illness work commitment accessibility concern disability caring commitment simply be away on holiday or in the case of my city serve in another country no one should be force to choose between voting and the demand of everyday life so it be only right that voter in wales and scotland have the same protection and access we must not allow postcode lottery when it come to democracy as my hon friend the member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith note if we as government be serious about strengthen trust in politic we must make voting easy not hard on that note of make voting easy it would be remiss of if be not to welcome the government move to allow the veteran id card to be use as valid voter identification that be really welcome by many portsmouth north resident who have serve our country it be absolutely right that those who have serve our country be not exclude from democratic participation due to id restriction many veteran particularly those who be old or more vulnerable tell how they face real challenge access approve form of id so recognise the veteran id card as valid be small but significant step towards honour that service and ensure their voice be hear in the ballot box although the bill do not address voting age want to place on record my strong support for extend voting right to and year old across the whole of the uk to ensure fairness whether in absent voting or by age young people in scotland and wales already vote in devolve and local election and it be time young people in england and northern ireland have the same voice across all election the bill be step towards fair and more accessible democracy it be step we must take congratulate my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert on bring forward the bill devolution have be an interest of mine for very long time it be the topic of my master dissertation and my first job outside politic so be thrilled to be back deal with it all again as member of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee the bill remind that one of the main argument in favour of introduce devolution be to free up parliamentary time it be consider bizarre that there we be in the late century when devolution be be debate with feudalism still in scotland because no government could possibly find the parliamentary time in the uk parliament to try to resolve those issue and other issue of concern to resident in scotland that highlight the importance of produce body that could grant that time to consider those issue and many other issue on local basis of what could be the good for resident in those area the fact that these measure be come via private member bill continue to highlight the importance of try to secure well parliamentary time for different part of the uk for the issue that matter to they and the importance of devolution to ensure that matter of relevance for scotland wales and northern ireland and hopefully for england in due course be address note that the amendment continue with that approach empower devolve government ability to implement change in their own way it highlight how it remain entirely possible for the nation to have the right power to deliver for their citizen in the right way without have to engage with all the problem that would come with any approach to independence so long may that approach continue be glad to see the consultation that have take place with devolved administration as believe consent be an incredibly important part of the process of ensure that our devolution settlement operate well believe that that be critical technically as unitary system we have parliamentary sovereignty in this place and the uk parliament can still legislate unilaterally in these area but if the devolve settlement be to survive every part of the united kingdom must be prepare to play their role in that partnership can not claim to be fan of the elections act which bring many of the provision into place during my time in local government be the chair of the working group that the local government association set up to go through the provision in the bill which be assist by representative of return officer and representative of electoral service administrator it would be fair to say that their view of most of the provision be wholly negative in the context of what the bill seek to do and many of the argument do not seem to make huge amount of sense at the time none the less we do produce number of cross party conclusion regrettably they be not adopt by the lga until far too late in the process to have have any viable impact the aspect in the bill be believe positive they should help to enable great access to absent voting for resident in scotland and wales and hopefully avoid some of the confusion that arise as country we have an increasingly confusing set of election arrangement many different type of electoral system be employ there be different age arrangement in different place and there be different rule around this that and the other when people think that one set of rule be in play and in fact give particular context there be another that create grow problem with confidence in our electoral system although it be challenge it be important to our democracy that as far as possible the general public understand how the system operate how they select their governor and how they express their voice that be critical part of the uk retain genuine democratic accountability the more that can be do to harmonise arrangement across the entire united kingdom and to ensure that there be much simple approach to people express their view to we the great the level of confidence in the system have two different set of arrangement around cast vote can not do much to encourage people to engage in the process the very low level of turnout at the last general election which be year ago today suggest that there be issue that need to be address in how we try to engage people in the process and encourage they to participate one big problem be that if we do not have viable system to enable people to cast their vote take into account people differ capacity to attend polling station we risk have bias in the system in favour of one set of group and against another young able bodied people and those who be less busy will be in well position to participate and submit their vote mean the electoral system will gradually move in favour of only part of the population that will deliver outcome in those election that may result in the system no long act as voice for the whole of society only part of that society we be all aware of some area where that already happen where there be high turnout by some group relative to other group result in they have preferential status in our electioneering the more that can be do to make it as easy as possible for people to cast their vote the great the likelihood that we will have more representative sample of elector participate in the system and that all our different institution will genuinely represent the view of constituent within the country and consequentially within policy conclude by congratulate my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith on introduce the bill it be an important step towards address many of the issue and hope further step will be forthcoming to increase great accountability and democratic participation in our democracy be oblige to my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert for introduce this important piece of legislation for hon member who do not know edinburgh north and leith the word and be very important in the name of that constituency leith be quite separate from edinburgh it be separate city and wonderful city too have many fond memory of be in my hon friend constituency because study in edinburgh and be involve in the children holiday venture charity which be still go strong student would take child who have be refer by social worker out swimming ice skating or away to the countryside for the weekend love my time with that charity know as the students in pilton in my hon friend seat the bill tackle the important issue of trust in politic in way it be mechanistic in that it look at mechanism for voting but trust in politic be damage if people feel that they can not exercise their right to vote because they have be exclude by be disabled on holiday or for other reason people trust in politic be damage if they feel that they be prevent from vote for reason that they quite properly view as be archaic and anachronistic these issue be raise with during the last general election campaign as it take place during the scottish school holiday we have different school holiday date in scotland they start early because our harvest be early not very important in glasgow east where there be no farm whatsoever people feel exclude from voting because they have go on holiday and the arrangement do not run as well as they ought to have do the bill give the scottish and welsh governments concurrent power to introduce regulation to enable application for postal and proxy vote for the devolved administrations to be make online use the government digital service that will make it easy for my constituent in carmyle wonderful mining village to vote the bill also align postal voting renewal cycle this be confusing for but postal voting cycle in scotland be not align and postal vote be very important for many people that will help for example postal voter in mount vernon who can not get to mount vernon primary school to exercise their right to vote that be important for confidence in democracy other example of divergence be set out well in the explanatory note which be pull together by my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith and the relevant department it be important to minimise divergence in this area and harmonise the rule because people will question our democracy if those in for example wishaw and tollcross speak about it early with its wonderful park be subject to different rule from say relative in northumberland newcastle corby or london that have be the subject of comment in report by the electoral commission and the electoral management board for scotland which do much important work in scrutinise election rule understand that pacac also take an interest in it it be important that these rule operate effectively so that for example constituent of mine in calton and bridgeton voting perhaps at bridgeton library sacred heart primary school or dalmarnock primary school can cast their vote it be important that those body keep this under control the bill result from close work with the uk government and the scottish government the secretary of state for scotland have put lot of work into ensure that the government work together where possible for the good of people in scotland my hon friend have highlight pacac work scrutinise election as parliament select committee that be oversee this part of the process we produce recommendation on behalf of the united kingdom as whole give that the bill will devolve to scottish government representative more delegate legislation power around implementation do he think it be important that we have close link between our own select committees and those in scotland and wales to ensure that the right lesson be learn and implement across the whole united kingdom rather than just in any one of its constituent part that be very good point and suggest that the chair of pacac pick it up with the chair of the scottish affairs committee there be learning from what happen in scotland that we can apply in the rest of our family of nation and vice versa although would say that there be no learning that we can draw from the snp government on run health service which be in catastrophic state in scotland speak of the health service which be suffer in scotland it be important order remind member that we really ought to stay in scope and discuss absent voting in scotland and wales and not necessarily the health service do apologise madam deputy speaker be just come to the point that this bill be so important because voter need to be able to exercise their right to vote to express their view on the management of council and the government in scotland and the bill enable people to do so apologise for appear to stray slightly but it be bring to that important point with that madam deputy speaker think we have hear enough from call the shadow minister first congratulate the hon member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert on her tenacity in get this bill through its parliamentary stage it be timely that the hon lady have today on the first anniversary of an election that might care to forget but that she will definitely care to remember for the rest of her career make such great change to our democratic structure through our bill if she have achieve this much in the first month for one look forward to see what she will achieve in the next four year would like to genuinely congratulate she on behalf of the official opposition and members across the house on the way she have conduct herself in get this legislation on the statute book her constituent will also quite rightly be proud also want to take this opportunity to wish member across the house happy first anniversary although technically the anniversary be tomorrow we be all tired in the early hour of that morning for it be am as remember wish happy anniversary to all new mp across the house on their first anniversary of serve in this place look forward to work with they on cross party basis over the next four year and maybe beyond rise be just about to refer to the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee but will let he go first wish the shadow minister happy anniversary too well thank the hon gentleman my friend for what know be warm and genuine congratulation be about to say that even congratulate the hon member for newcastle under lyme happy anniversary on his election be still utterly convinced that while he be the most sartorially elegant mp on the labour the whip on duty the hon member for bury south christian wakeford who have not even bother to wear tie be somehow shout shame say to the hon member for newcastle under lyme that be still convinced that deep down he be secret conservative and we look forward to see his slow conversion to this side of the house over the next four year wishful thinking be all will say madam deputy speaker be very proud of my labour party membership card thank you very much thou doth protest too much think we will just keep it to the fact that the hon gentleman be the most sartorially elegant member of the labour parliamentary party and would be grateful after this debate if he could tell where he get his tie by the way also want to say happy anniversary to those of we who survive the last election too especially my hon friend the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew who be sit on the front bench next to welcome the minister be in her place the conservative completely agree with her remark on the amendment that be table it be perfectly straightforward and we support it in rare moment of cross party unity we completely echo what the minister have say and therefore we do not need to say much more on that will just pay tribute to the four back bench contributor for their remark the hon member for newcastle under lyme have say he be make habit of beat conservative but let we just see what happen in four year time will not predict what will happen at the next election as say early he be genuine friend and genuinely like his engage contribution to many debate in this house they be always back up by the principle aim he have in any area of policy in this house long may that continue the hon member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith give great speech she set out the full scope of the bill clearly and how it will make tangible change to many people who live in scotland congratulate she on that even though the hon member for portsmouth north amanda martin be from rival city down the solent from think she make an excellent contribution she make important point on the change to the legislation to ensure that veteran card can be use as official id for voting represent many veteran in my community particularly naval veteran as know the hon lady do with the home of the royal navy in portsmouth north and know that that be vital change that be be make it be commitment of the previous government think it be fair to say that parliamentary time run out so we be unable to do that so be pleased that that the new government take that forward the hon member for crawley peter lamb be right to share his expertise on devolution and give fascinating historical context for this bill remember be in the stag head pub on the university of southampton campus in when he be chairman of the university labour society and be chairman of its conservative association for transparency will declare that it be lot small than the labour society be not sure whether he ever imagine that we would share chamber today as we see from his speech he be fierce defender of democracy fierce supporter of devolution and passionate defender of his belief and principle wish he well go forward be very grateful to the hon member for his kind remark give that we be talk about democratic engagement and encourage great participation do he agree that there be few well way of encourage people to engage with the system than get they into student politic at university my hon friend the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew just say that he could not think of anything bad but absolutely agree with the hon gentleman see something very special in he when we battle together he be in the year above though hon member might not think so from look at he absolutely agree that university can be at the forefront and heart of early democratic engagement and can shape people view and political compass be perfectly willing to say in this house that my politic or year ago be very different from my politic today that be down to the genuinely open nature of debate in this chamber and most importantly on university campus be feel bit leave out because the hon member for glasgow east john grady regularly intervene on other but have not intervene on he give staunch defence of the bill in some particularly pertinent area and talk about other area that be maybe not so pertinent will watch he over the next four year wonder how many school in his constituency he have mention in his first month in this house will the hon gentleman give way as if could not thank the hon gentleman for his kind word have spend lot of time with he on the planning and infrastructure bill committee know that the charming way in which he present his submission would enhance people trust in politic include those vote at calton parkhead parish church hall be oblige the hon gentleman never let down hope he do not say that within earshot of the leader of the opposition but can promise she on the floor of the house that she have nothing to worry about from like he will carry on engage in debate in this house where we do not agree we can do so in nice polite and respectful way we be talk about enhance democracy for the people of scotland through this legislation the way that member have conduct themselves today serve as lesson on how people should conduct themselves be not talk about any specific party the bill be welcome and make the necessary provision to ensure that where there be divergence the whole of great britain share democratic value be bring into close practical alignment it support the unity of our democratic system while respect the devolved nation identity the conservative party will always look to bridge the gap between the constituent national community that make our country so vibrant in my role on the opposition front bench spend much of my time fight against what perceive to be the government repeat attempt to strip local people of their agency and voice have have disagreement with the hon member for glasgow east on the planning and infrastructure bill but this bill be refreshing frankly it be relief to be able to support the work of the hon member for edinburgh north and leith who have bring forward bill that empower rather than undermine our citizen specifically we welcome the provision that make it easy for people across scotland and wales to participate in election this bill honour the principle that democracy should be accessible to all not privilege for the few that be principle that we on the conservative benches will always defend as know the minister do through her role accessibility be vital but so too be security protect the integrity of our election and guard against fraud or interference be core responsibility of any government minister must take decisive and proactive step while modernise and reform our system to prevent malign influence whether domestic or foreign we do not have to look for long to see instance of electoral interference from foreign state and non state actor indeed most recently it be report that dozen of anonymous pro scottish independence account allegedly operate by iran islamic revolutionary guard corps have go silent since israel launch strike on iranian military and cyber target on june the account which seem to use fake scottish identity to spread anti uk sentiment be identify by clemson university researcher as be part of suspect foreign influence campaign that example be one among many and it illustrate an important point that we all must take seriously that be why welcome the government state commitment to work closely with the electoral commission and other to protect the integrity security and effectiveness of uk election and referendum urge they to ensure that this be not just rhetoric but reality it be right to note that the bill build on work by the previous government include the elections act which take important step to strengthen the security of our democratic process introduce requirement such as digital imprint on online campaign material and enhance transparency in political funding those be much need reform and it be shame that legislative consent be not give to those measure in the bill now mitigate the effect of that decision as the hon member for edinburgh north and leith say the inclusion of identity verification for postal and proxy vote application be another necessary measure to close off vulnerability in our system there must not be mismatch between how people register by post and how they do so digitally these be technical detail but their impact on the integrity of our electoral process be profound we must not allow inconsistent standard to become weak spot in our democracy because we can be sure that our adversary abroad would use those to divide we and cause chaos in any way they can this bill represent sensible and timely move to enhance voter access and uphold the integrity of our electoral system by align absent voting procedure in devolve election with those across the rest of the united kingdom it help to modernise and safeguard our democratic process for the future crucially it also empower voter in scotland and wales by make participation in election simple and more accessible must reiterate what say on second reading urge the government to abandon their plan to water down voter id requirement they have find it within themselves to make turn in other area today we be legislate to make voting easy for people while maintain adequate security but we can not also have the government water down voter id requirement which would reduce security in our voting system on that rare note of disharmony during an afternoon of unity congratulate the hon member for edinburgh north and leith again on the constructive and inclusive approach that she have take look forward to see this legislation on the statute book let we see whether she bring more legislation forward over the next four year to make real difference in this country congratulate my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert on all her fantastic work and on ensure there be cross party support for this bill echo the point that the shadow minister the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes make about her ability to make such an important change so quickly we be celebrate it be year since the general election commend my hon friend the members for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for aylesbury laura kyrke smith for portsmouth north amanda martin for crawley peter lamb and for glasgow east john grady for their excellent speech which highlight the importance of this private member bill they also point out some of the change that we have already make for instance be proud to have introduce the veteran id card while in government there be also specific proposal in our manifesto to reduce the voting age so that and year old can vote the government share the commitment of my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith to this bill which will give people in scotland and wales the same choice for manage their voting arrangement for devolved election as they already have for reserved election many of we will remember time when absent voting in the uk be still govern by excessively restrictive criterion elector have to provide valid reason such as illness travel or occupational constraint to qualify for postal vote similarly proxy voting be limit to those with clear impediment to attend the polling station this change in when postal voting on demand be introduce in great britain allow elector to freely apply for postal vote that change be quickly embrace by the electorate in the general election there be significant increase in the number of postal vote issue compare with previous election and by the figure have more than double by over million postal vote be issue across the uk now that elector have be give the choice to vote in way that good suit they and their need it have become clear that there be significant demand for flexibility in how people exercise their democratic right while it be less commonly use the option to vote via proxy have also remain viable and necessary alternative for many elector across the country in measure be introduce to verify the identity of postal voter they add layer of security to the process and ensure that elector could have confidence in the system these include the requirement for voter to provide personal identifier such as their date of birth and signature when apply for and return postal ballot the introduction of the register to vote service in give elector the ability to go online and make their application to vote without need to submit paper application that change much like the change to absent voting have prove extremely popular with the electorate in over of all application to register to vote be make use the online service with less than take the traditional paper route the modernisation of our electoral system through the change have just lay out have prove popular with elector time and again the bill relate to the online absent vote application service which as have be point out go live in october as result of the need to modernise the way in which elector apply for their absent vote give the enthusiasm that elector have show for the freedom to decide the method by which they cast their ballot and the clear preference for use online service to apply to vote it be no surprise that the new online absent vote application service have also prove popular unfortunately as we have hear voter in scotland and wales can use the new online service to apply for postal and proxy vote only for reserved election such as election to the uk parliament the benefit of extend the online absent vote application service to devolve election for elector in scotland and wales be clear it will allow people in scotland and wales the option of apply online for postal or proxy vote for devolve parliamentary and local election or of apply through traditional paper application in scotland and wales voter who wish to apply for postal or proxy vote in devolve parliamentary or local election must still complete paper application form and submit it by post as we have hear this bill seek to give elector in scotland and wales the same choice as other over how they apply for their absent vote for use in senedd cymru scottish parliament and local election as my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith have say the scottish parliament and senedd cymru will hold their parliamentary election in may it would be hugely beneficial both to voter and to electoral administrator in scotland and wales alike if access to the online service be make available in time for those election there be great deal of enthusiasm from the scottish and welsh governments about the benefit as be make clear to in my meeting in cardiff this week with the scottish government minister for parliamentary business and the welsh government cabinet secretary for housing and local government as my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith say the bill have be welcome by those work in the scottish and welsh electoral sector my official work closely with the electoral administration community and as such can say with confidence that the bill will deliver clear benefit for both elector and administrator in particular by remove the need for duplicate application to be make for devolved and reserved absent vote that mean less time for elector spend make application and less time for administrator spend processing application we will continue to work closely with the scottish and welsh governments include on technical aspect of the bill implementation the change in the bill represent just one of the way that this government intend to encourage electoral engagement and participation as have mention we will also lower the voting age give year old and year old the right to shape their future at the ballot box we will set out plan to far strengthen the integrity of election and encourage participation in democracy we be work in partnership with the electoral sector to bring about the change in this bill and the many other change we be seek to make be grateful to my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith for her tireless work on this important bill be also grateful to the shadow minister for his and his

friday to speak in support of it thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith once again for her work and look forward to work with colleague to ensure that the bill pass hope very much that member will support the bill measure and ensure that it advance to the other place with the leave of the house call tracy gilbert to wind up with the leave of the house thank you madam deputy speaker and thank member from across the house for their contribution and support today in particular thank the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes for his very kind remark it show how we can work across the house with kindness and mutual support which be very grateful for thank my team for the work they have do to support during this first year and for help to bring this bill forward along with official from government departments without their support would not have be able to bring the bill to the house look forward to the continued support of hon member for the bill as it pass through its stage it be apt to be speak today when year ago today we be all await our fate to see whether we would be make the journey to this place put on the record my thank to my constituent in edinburgh north and leith for enable to secure my place in this house thereby enable to take forward this piece of legislation it will enhance democracy and encourage participation for all our constituent across the whole of the uk look forward to the bill receive support to enable it to pass to the other place question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass space industry indemnities bill third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time will start with short summary of the bill which will amend two section of the space industry act to provide legal certainty that all spaceflight operator licence must include limit on the amount of the operator liability to the government under section of the act the reason for that be that under international law applicable to space government include the uk be liable for damage to property or death or personal injury cause by space activity section pass on that liability to spaceflight operator and require they to indemnify the government without legal certainty over cap much need investment in the uk space industry which be critical for defence and civilian purpose will be hold back and that investment will go elsewhere that be the purpose of the bill to encourage vital investment in our space sector of which we should be proud realise that parliamentarian in this place have not always be enthusiastic about space when the soviet spacecraft luna reach the surface of the moon on september the foreign secretary selwyn lloyd who go on to be speaker of this place react with great enthusiasm he say do think many people be terribly interested in the russian rocket despite it be historic harold macmillan on the other hand be much more enthusiastic when armstrong and aldrin be wait in the lunar module and we have have man on the moon harold wilson say we must all be fill with profound sense of wonder and admiration in witness this historic event in fact the uk play an important role in that space mission and uk industry be involve too there be somewhat of stooshie scot word for row about the failure of the british ambassador to attend the launch and his letter in the national archives explain why his explanation basically boil down to the fact that he have be to one previously and that once you have see one space launch you have see they all it just go to show that the importance of the special relationship be nothing new but it do cause somewhat of stooshie of course nothing in be as important as newcastle united win the inter cities fairs cup my hon friend just talk about the importance of the space sector to so many of we and indeed to the whole of the uk will he join in welcome this labour uk government investment in the space sector in scotland yes the uk government have invest in orbex in forres in the north of scotland it remain important to give grant to early stage company because they can not get the equity and debt funding that more advanced company can so welcome that important investment the space sector and satellite be central to almost everyone day to day life when we tap in and out of the underground on the way home or when we purchase thing that rely on satellite technology space be also key focus for the national wealth fund as confirm by lord livermore who be financial secretary to the treasury and john flint the chief executive of the national wealth fund when we discuss the fund at the treasury committee this week space be an important future business for britain and an important economic opportunity another reason why it be important to invest in space be for defence it be critical to the defence of the united kingdom if we have vibrant space industry in the united kingdom that will support the technological innovation we need to defend our country and our ally as we move into much more difficult foreign policy context be sure my hon friend will be aware of the role that the starlink system have play in ukraine in enable the frontline operation of the ukrainian army for very long time gps be the main determinator of whether trident could arrive at its destination it strike that in some way the technology our ability to put thing into space and what we be put up there will be what absolutely determine the nature of warfare in the century do my hon friend agree my hon friend make an important point the uk government have commit to invest in defence and in advance in tech defence as we develop defence invest in space be utterly critical and central to that it be matter of some regret that scottish company that invest in military matter be not fund by the scottish national investment bank or scottish enterprise because they have the view that we should not invest in defence even though it will create job and be important for defend the north of scotland which be where my mother come from and which be now very important for defence be an mp for glasgow which have rich history of innovation and an incredibly promising cluster of space expertise my seat have the fantastic university of strathclyde recently meet professor malcolm macdonald from the university who be the director of the centre for signal and image processing and the apply space technology laboratory he outline to with great enthusiasm and knowledge the amount of innovation in the space sector in glasgow and across the united kingdom this be critical industry that we must invest in and for which we must create the condition of investment around people work in the space sector across the uk so this be big opportunity let turn to talk about precisely what the bill do albeit with four word it seek to limit space operator liability emphasise that spaceflight activity be heavily regulate by the uk civil aviation authority for safety there be day to day scrutiny of their safety from an expert safety regulator the caa be one of the good regulator in the world so we be concern with small risk that be reduce to the very minimum extent possible by very strong regulatory regime one of the reason why our family of nation have great advantage in space be that because we be right at the end of europe we have great place to launch because we do not launch over big urban area if we go right up to shetland there be nothing for hundred of mile there be treaty under international space law and the uk government have long stand legal liability for damage cause by uk spaceflight relate operation despite the space safety regime there be residual risk that thing go wrong and the uk government face claim the uk government can make claim against operator which take place under section of the act that be quite proper operator have to assume and bear risk and the government need to ensure that operator can pay out on claim make against they as we be quite rightly adopt cross party spirit today commend the previous government on their work on space law which be why the regime under the act make provision for space operator to put in place compulsory insurance the business have to insure themselves and be regulate by very competent regulator the question be what happen if claim exceed the amount of insurance that can be put in place on sensible basis that be really what we be address here the current legislation do not require the civil aviation authority or the government to include cap in the licence it make it optional section of the act provide an operator licence may specify limit on the amount of the licensee liability under section in respect of the activity authorise by the licence the critical thing that my bill will do be quite simply to swap may for must and as consequence the word any in section be change to the that be consistent with long stand government policy that the liability should be limit there be clear document policy that it be limited however the problem with document policy as oppose to statute as recover lawyer go back to my legal career here be that government policy be ultimately much easy to change than statute we can have claim for legitimate expectation and breach of those but that be very difficult class of claim to run and there have not be huge number of successful case of that sort in the court it be difficult area of public law business quite properly say you could change this policy and expose our exist investment to additional risk business could also fairly go and look elsewhere for investment investor will not invest in the same way in the face of lack of statutory protection so the critical thing the bill do be to include statutory protection it require the government to cap the liability and encourage people to invest and that put we on par with our principal competitor nation for space investment so four word to the bill with two swap but it be absolutely critical for the future of an industry that could be brilliant for the united kingdom and all our constituent for year to come do my hon friend agree that the space sector give our country and indeed to the world sense of possibility and innovation he talk about the four word in the bill buzz lightyear provide we with another four word to take inspiration from to infinity and beyond my hon friend make an excellent point as she do regularly the space sector create enthusiasm for young people when meet young student at the university of strathclyde could see that it have engender excitement about the future and that be good thing draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests speak on this bill as the chair of the all party parliamentary group for space congratulate the hon member for glasgow east john grady on have such massive effect on the uk space industry by change just two word in the space industry act his bill be perhaps one of the most sublime bills relate to the space sector that have see it be truly incredible that we can have such change to our industry we have have space sector in this country for many year and it have be quite successful as we have hear it be currently worth about billion year and employ about people but the sector potential be absolutely enormous the expectation be that by the global space sector will be worth trillion and it be the ambition of this country at some point to get about of that sector that would be billion year of economic activity so it be incredibly important the hon gentleman make important point about the space sector and all the exciting thing we can do beyond the kármán line in space importantly for those scottish members present we will see the most symbolic part of the space sector to the north of unst in the shetland island hopefully before the year be out launch from british soil that be genuinely very exciting our whole economy can benefit the hon gentleman be help to open up an opportunity for the city of london which for long time have be financer of innovation trade and many different thing importantly it have be one of the big wholesale and specialist insurance market in the world by change two word in the act the hon gentleman be not only unleash spaceflight licensing for the uk but unleash yet more opportunity at lloyd of london on top of that as we see more space business come to locate in the uk because of that opportunity we will see even more opportunity such as space company be list on the london stock exchange bond issue and whole load of corporate finance activity beyond that there will be yet more activity in the legal sector for example the bill be therefore incredibly important the hon gentleman have do something incredibly simple but incredibly important and all in the space sector be incredibly grateful have small anecdote about buzz lightyear we hear mention of his catchphrase to infinity and beyond meet buzz aldrin son few year ago and make joke about to infinity and beyond to he and he turn around to and say the disney corporation never pay my dad enough for that congratulate the hon gentleman on his bill it will be truly transformational thank my hon friend the member for glasgow east john grady for bring the bill forward also thank the hon member for wyre forest mark garnier for chair the all party parliamentary group for space and for his promotion of the sector as the mp for portsmouth north strongly support this pivotal bill which will unlock further growth in our already thrive regional space cluster it will ensure that operator take responsibility but critically that their liability be limited as we hear from my hon friend that statutory provision will bring we in line with our competitor portsmouth and the wide hampshire region be increasingly central to the uk space ambition through initiative such as space south central we be part of the large regional space cluster in the country which generate more than billion annually and employ more than people in portsmouth our university small and medium sized enterprise and global industry leader work in close partnership to pioneer satellite application mission design and advanced technology the bill provision to offer limited government indemnity to commercial launch provider be critical it will lower barrier to entry de risk new venture attract investment and enable orbital mission from uk soil that be not just theoretical it have real implication for portsmouth space sector let highlight some of the potential beneficiary in my city the university of portsmouth institute of cosmology and gravitation be actively design small satellite mission from earth observation cubesat to lunar radio probe its space mission incubator and cosmocube project be prime example of innovation that stand to gain from accelerated launch capability the university also host the south coast centre of excellence in satellite applications part of the satellite applications catapult which support business in satellite development data drive service and ai application the indemnity will provide confidence to those sme enter into new orbit venture in the private sector global giant such as airbus defence and space operate from portsmouth hilsea facility its multimillion pound oberon reconnaissance satellite contract with the ministry of defence sustain local job role that will be bolster by more robust uk space launch ecosystem it also provide fantastic apprenticeship opportunity for young people hampshire base firm such as qinetiq bae systems lockheed martin and airbus be deeply integrate into space innovation and locally into our community with the bill indemnity framework these organisation university and company alike will gain access to fast mission approval and great capacity to adopt emerge uk launch provider with result include new job expand contract strengthen regional growth and win for my city let we consider the bill impact more research lead satellite such as cosmocube could be develop and launch from cornwall or scotland but portsmouth business will be able to contribute all the way from design to orbit portsmouth science technology engineering and math pipeline from utc portsmouth through to the university mission space programme will benefit enormously from real home grow launch activity that will inspire student help retain talent and create new high tech career path charity and public service will also benefit space enable monitoring application power by datum from low cost satellite could support coastal management environmental protection and emergency response in my maritime city it would be remiss of not to mention the charity that be trustee of stemunity which have fantastic reception this week and by work with number of other charity and public and private sector company have introduce young people to the world of space this be not just technical fix of four word it be strategic piece of legislation that can help cement portsmouth place in the uk space age and indeed the uk in the world by reduce risk for our inventor thank my hon friend the member for glasgow east john grady for bring forward this important bill it be fantastic to see space make in today programme to debate it many of the contribution have be out of this world interruption be sorry madam deputy speaker the bill be timely and necessary measure to sharpen the uk competitive edge in what be undoubtedly one of the most strategically important domain of our time have almost complete my first year on the armed force parliamentary scheme have see at first hand that our security rely not only on land sea and air but increasingly on the space domain and our asset in orbit satellite communication earth observation and precise navigation form the backbone of military operation but also of our civil economy will come back to that later as my hon friend the member for crawley peter lamb point out in his intervention any disruption up there have immediate and profound consequence to operation down here we know at first hand that china and other nation be take leap and bound in its drive to dominate the space domain so anything we can do to strengthen the uk space economy be critical before come to this house be very fortunate that my team support client such as defence equipment support in negotiation around the space domain in particular provide well commercial and buy support which be critical so have see at first hand the complexity of this emerge market and how the public sector need to keep up to date and respond to the demand and the ask of the private sector and drive growth just down the road from in harwell project complete by my former firm in the national satellite test facility receive million of new investment by the public sector through the science and facilities technology council that show that when we unlock investment it be not just about the asset that end up in space but about the big chunky complex engineering construction opportunity that be open up in place such as the oxcam corridor where my constituency sit through that work have see how the private sector be poise and hungry to drive forward the next wave of space innovation what be hold we back generally be not technology talent innovation or the drive for growth but regulatory uncertainty despite the fact that the bill relate to only four word as my hon friend the member for glasgow east say it will make big difference the space industry act lay the groundwork for the modern commercial sector we have in space commend the previous government as we be debate in spirit of collaboration and co operation across the house for their work on that and for the space industrial strategy which be publish later can see echo of that now in the industrial strategy and know that when the defence industrial strategy come out later in the year space will be front and centre of that as well it be positive that we can build on some of the good work do by the conservatives without know what financial exposure firm might face if an accident or an incident occur company hesitate to invest insurer demand eye water premium and ultimately we lose manufacture contract to other jurisdiction the simple but powerful adjustment make by the bill change the law so that the indemnity limit for each operator licence be not optional but mandatory each licence must spell out the licensee maximum liability this be an essential risk management mechanism and it mean that company know exactly what they be sign up for it also allow they to secure insurance in predictable way in the construction sector we have lot of unpredictable insurance post grenfell and particularly post industrial shock so know how for commercial business insecure insurance and unpredictability of insurance be important the government new industrial strategy be really positive for the space sector in my constituency the bill will stimulate job and growth it specifically recognise that the government will be invest in research and development for the space industry through the cambridge growth company which will drive new opportunity for my constituent when we consider this issue we must also remember the wide stake be enjoy my hon friend speech on space must declare that prefer to have my foot firmly on planet earth but none the less be enjoy his contribution have be advise that man be from mars and woman be from venus where do my hon friend think those on the second opposition bench be from be sure they be work hard in their constituency right now where they be from not where they be where they be from do not know but be sure they be work hard in their constituency right now will keep the collegiate relationship we have here today but thank my hon friend for that comment be talk about international impact as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on international trade and investment think the bill be very positive step forward to help drive investment as we see country such as the us luxembourg australia and japan change their regulatory regime we need to keep that front and centre do say would briefly mention the civil economy as we have minister from the department here today regulatory certainty matter see that the sustainable aviation fuel bill be come forward but note that the fuel strategy be also very important one in five of my constituent work in logistic so it be critical that we see certainty in all sector of the department for transport will conclude by say this space be no long the preserve of big government agency alone we see lot of innovation as my hon friend the member for portsmouth north amanda martin say in relation to her constituency there be fierce commercial competition and lot of opportunity the bill will ensure that whether we be explore near space planet exoplanet exomoon or even go out far into space we support the british economy and get the space industry grow will try to keep my remark brief start by congratulate my hon friend the member for glasgow east john grady on make many fine contribution today and still manage to find time to pass his own bill this be an area of personal interest to make the terrible choice year ago to go into politic but most of my family be scientist my grandfather be professor sir robert boyd who be often describe as the father of british space science my dad still work in the sector the pace at which the industry be progress be quite remarkable when spacex and virgin galactic first come out think to myself how on earth be these company go to make any money at all but they could certainly see the future in all of this as have be set out the opportunity present by space be vast and legislation need to keep pace ultimately it be question of risk risk will always be part of the process as it be in every part of life it be perfectly possible to manage it in way that make it viable to undertake various activity the bill in its four word set out to resolve that address liability and insurance issue to enable the viability of the uk space industry which surely will be see as vital area of economic growth in time to follow and of national security as have be discuss no doubt the discussion of risk may arouse concern from the general public but for the average person the risk be vanishingly low most object send up into space be far too small to survive re entry frankly huge satellite pose far great risk to each other now through what be know as kessler syndrome where one knock into another and that set off cascade that destroy all the satellite in low orbit make they completely unusable the risk of an individual be hit by space debris be less than one in trillion rocket can blow up they be very similar to missile but they tend to be limit to small range of place which consistently be remote and follow path unlikely to pose risk to people property the industry have to have an approach to risk but from an individual perspective we should not in any way be worried as have be highlight the civil aviation authority which happen to be base in my constituency play significant role in that it do fine work in this area in addition to general aviation the bill manage these risk well it be vital part of how to deliver an economy of the future for the uk and be delighted to support it call the shadow minister it be great pleasure to speak again on the bill it be short bill it replace just two word but one with substantial implication the meat of the bill if can call it that be to replace may with must will briefly refer to some of the excellent contribution be relieve to have hear many few revolting pun than in previous debate on this subject nevertheless couple slip through start with the sponsor of the bill the hon member for glasgow east john grady who set out the commercial need for the change to the act he make the sensible point that government policy be easy to change than statute if we be not sure of that before this week one should just ask the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer to understand that it be easy to change policy than it be to change legislation my hon friend the member for wyre forest mark garnier be the chair of the all party parliamentary group for space which make he eminently well qualified to speak in this debate be ponder my own qualification and the good could come up with be that play rugby for team call the space cadets when be at university that be about as close as could get to the space industry my hon friend rightly make the case for role for the city of london he mention develop opportunity for lloyds of london listing bond issuance and subsequent legal support the hon member for portsmouth north amanda martin highlight the role of portsmouth and the wide hampshire space cluster she say that it be just four word that need to be change in that sentence she double the size of the bill the hon member for northampton south mike reader reflect on space development in the context of defence and on commercial opportunity be hold back because of regulatory uncertainty he be right to highlight that regulatory certainty matter finally the hon member for crawley peter lamb say he be the grandson of the father of british space science which presumably make he the son of british space science we can not complain about inadequate consideration of the bill the first attempt to enact the change be introduce by the former member for woking jonathan lord and we have second reading of very similarly word bill on february unfortunately that bill be lose in the parliamentary wash up session as result of the general election be call later that year be pleased that the incoming government have through their inspirational back benchers be able to introduce private member bill in very similar term second reading be quite long time ago back on march this year but since then the bill have be through committee and undergone robust line by line consideration be pleased to report to the house that the word must have not be alter in committee wonder whether definitely should or really ought be posit by member but in the end we have the same wording as on second reading we now come to the remain stage no doubt to an enormous sigh of relief from the industry and perhaps little bit of frustration about why it have take so long to change just two word in an act that receive royal assent back in as personal observation question whether the private member bill route be appropriate for legislation that have such significant commercial impact the industry have be wait we have hear from speaker after speaker about the commercial importance of change may to must and yet it have take seven year from identify the original problem to effect solution we need to really think about that because this bill be important and delay have have cost the uk space industry generate billion for our economy there be at least business involve in it some job be directly employ by the space industry and with the supply chain that number increase to no doubt those figure be out of date as it be grow industry we have strong demand for uk commercial spaceflight that lead to the original regulatory benefit arise out of our brexit freedom to have dynamic regulatory environment it have give we genuine economic commercial advantage over our european friend and neighbour because we have be able to have more dynamic approach to regulation however that have be put at risk because of the difficulty in calculate potential liability other have already go through the legal nicety of the space industry act so do not propose to go through those line by line as would normally suffice it to say the legal duty of space operator be to provide insurance for their operation and that be require under the act that bring corollary obligation to make calculation to potential exposure if someone be make an actuarial calculation of the risk to which client be expose an insurer they need to undertake calculation of the scale the quantum of that risk this be where the regulatory uncertainty have play its part although it have be repeat in this chamber and elsewhere that it be and remain government policy to have an indemnity beyond certain level of liability the uncertainty be that the legislation do not require the government to do that section give the civil aviation authority the regulatory authority in this case power to set an upper limit to provide clarity this bill turn that power into an obligation which be quite right we have have fun debate and be very pleased that the legislation be near the end of its legislative journey but we collectively need to stop and think this be an uncontroversial change with cross party support support growth industry and yet it have take five month to progress from second reading to the remain stage that be simply not good enough we collectively need to think of way in which we can get this kind of legislation accelerate launch into space be never straightforward and this bill be no exception it have an initial flare out on its launchpad before the last general election and since then it have have an excruciatingly slow reconstruction and review but it be finally ready for launch and wish it well hope it release many further launch across the united kingdom thank my hon friend the member for glasgow east john grady for promote this short but important bill want to get far into newcastle united inter cities fairs cup win in but do not think today be the day thank all who have contribute to the debate thank the hon member for wyre forest mark garnier for his chairmanship of the appg for space thank my hon friend the members for portsmouth north amanda martin for northampton south mike reader and for crawley peter lamb thank the shadow minister the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for his support as well he mention pun attempt pun in the house the other day and mr speaker remind to stick to the day job will not try to emulate my hon friend the member for northampton south this industry be so important and it will be go forward it have already be say that it contribute billion to the uk economy and it be already employ people right across our land be pleased to confirm that the bill have the government full support we have economic growth at the heart of our agenda and we be take step to support major infrastructure and to reduce bureaucratic red tape in regulatory framework to well support innovation and growth in the uk the minister talk about economic growth recently meet mongolian lady work at the satellite applications catapult which exist to grow the uk space sector we have hear about buzz aldrin and buzz lightyear be afraid have pun come with that in mind will the minister set out in further detail perhaps at the dispatch box now how he foresee the bill give the space sector the rocket booster it need to go to infinity and beyond today be july and there will be firework across the pond but we want rocket booster under our space industry most of europe be landlocke or should say space locked which provide the uk with unique opportunity to be launchpad for satellite produce all around europe that be the market that we be go for the industry have make it clear that hold unlimited liability will have an adverse effect on the uk spaceflight industry if the government do not limit spaceflight operator liability spaceflight company and investor might move to jurisdiction that have more favourable liability regime where operator liability be limited or that provide guarantee to meet all claim or those above the operator limit of liability such as the us or france for those reason we be pleased to support the bill with the leave of the house call john grady to wind up will keep my remark short thank all member for their support today on second reading and in committee also thank the department for transport civil servant who assist the clerk of private member bill put in lot of work to help we all with our private member bills and give thank to they as well this bill will now go to another place where baroness anelay of st johns have kindly agree to take it on and thank she for so do should also thank the hon member for wyre forest mark garnier who have be nothing but enthusiastic about this bill from the off it be good to hear enthusiasm and speak as new member or year old member it be always very helpful to have advice from member from across the chamber of course thank my team for their help with the bill thank you for your patience madam deputy speaker and also thank the voter and resident of glasgow east because it be privilege to be here represent they love every minute of my time represent my seat question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass licensing hours extensions bill bill not amend in the public bill committee consider third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time the licensing hours extensions bill propose by my hon friend the member for wrexham andrew ranger be about cut red tape and unnecessary and time consume bureaucracy for the hospitality industry and local authority when they simply want to open early or stay open later on occasion of special importance the bill will amend the licensing act to allow licensing extension to be make more quickly and simply furthermore it will make it possible to extend licensing hour for noteworthy event at short notice even when parliament be not sit such decision will be consider on case by case basis and extension will be use as and when be deem appropriate by the government with the criterion for make such an extension remain unchanged and the power rest with the home secretary the bill will make very simple alteration to the licensing act so that the negative procedure be use and the requirement for debate be remove though member can still pray against an extension if they wish that will allow extension to license hour to be process without use up valuable parliamentary time something be certain you would approve of madam deputy speaker it be extremely welcome that there have be broad support and consensus across the house for this measure whether that say something about parliamentarian and pint could not possibly say the negative procedure also have the benefit of allow licensing extension to be make in the rare event that they be need during parliamentary recess or at short notice follow the affirmative procedure be problematic when an order need to be make at short notice as we have see in the past for example at the time of the woman world cup in this summer the woman club world cup come to northampton if it be in another country this legislation would be critical because be sure that many want to see the england woman rugby team play as they will do at franklin gardens do my hon friend agree that as we see more interest in sport particularly woman sport it be critical that the government have the ability to change licensing hour without the affirmative procedure my hon friend be absolutely correct this be vital legislation it be wholly appropriate to make this alteration in order to permit swift change to licensing hour as necessary this move will ensure that there will be no such limitation in the future and that any hospitality venue will have the option of take advantage of an extension issue by the home secretary special occasion such as world cup european championship and royal wedding live long in all our memory even if we be enjoy the hospitality so enable it be only right that our pub and hospitality venue be give the opportunity to be part of the experience on those occasion my hon friend the member for wrexham and hope that the bill will pass today and will do exactly what it say on the tin especially on this day of celebration one year on from the general election as the member of parliament for portsmouth north be proud to speak in support of the licensing hours extensions bill which be sensible and necessary reform to support our struggle hospitality sector and as we have hear allow community to come together during moment of national significance the bill give the government the power to extend licensing hour across the country for key event such as royal celebration national sporting victory and commemorative day without the need for venue to go through costly and time consume individual application for portsmouth north this be more than just technical measure it be lifeline across area such as north end drayton cosham and hilsea we have see much love venue close their door in recent year yet some still stand strong at the heart of our community pub such as the harvest home in copnor the george in cosham the drayton tavern in drayton and the cross keys in paulsgrove where my mum and dad meet have fight to keep go despite increase pressure from rise cost staff shortage and regulatory burden for many of these venue the opportunity to stay open later during special event without additional red tape could mean the difference between profitable night and another loss want to highlight the role of casemate studios in hilsea although primarily creative space it support range of community event music gig and social gathering more flexible licensing arrangement will allow place like casemate to well host local talent and public event tie to national occasion without the financial or bureaucratic strain that often put they off even try this bill support exactly that kind of local community lead vibrancy have speak with business owner across my constituency know how hard they have work to stay afloat the licensing hours extensions bill remove an unnecessary hurdle it simplify the process reduce cost and give our hospitality business fair shot at success when it matter most on those big night when our country be celebrate let be clear this be not about hand out licence indiscriminately the bill rightly ensure that local authority and the police be consult before any national extension be grant mean that resident will still be protect from antisocial behaviour and decision will reflect the need of the whole community portsmouth north pub and venue be not just business they be place where people gather celebrate mark milestone and find connection this bill give they boost at time when many be struggle to keep the light on be pleased to support the bill and urge colleague across the house to do the same for the sake of our local economy our community spirit and the future of our british pub as our lionesses begin their euros campaign wish they our very good call the shadow minister be grateful to the hon member for watford matt turmaine for bring forward this private member bill alongside the hon member for wrexham andrew ranger and be pleased to confirm that the conservative party support the measure it be legislation that the previous conservative government support and we welcome its return to the house the bill change section of the licensing act move licensing hour order from the affirmative to the negative procedure as we have hear this will save precious parliamentary time while maintain full democratic accountability through the prayer procedure which allow member to object within day the hospitality sector be vital to local economy throughout the united kingdom from rural pub to city centre hotel these business need the flexibility to serve their community during national celebration when his majesty the king be crown in establishment across the country want to mark that historic occasion the current process make it unnecessarily difficult to respond to such moment of national significance since this power have be use sparingly for national event every single order have have to pass through parliament and have do so unopposed public consultation also show strong support with back the coronation extension to licence in when this bill have its second reading put it to the minister who be respond then the right hon member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson that this be rather puny measure and that there be strong case for deregulate this whole area and for get parliament and the government out of the hospitality sector hair in relation to licensing hour do my hon friend agree that this bill be far too limited measure thank my hon friend for his intervention of course we should all strive for deregulation and would like more of it all the time that be probably bit too much to take on within the very small confine of this private member bill but it be certainly something we should strive for in order to help business across the country and definitely something would look at be grateful to my hon friend for give way again will she also include within her inquiry and her thought about ambition some more control over the negative procedure the hon member for watford matt turmaine who introduce the bill today assert that anybody who be against an order pass under the negative procedure would be able to pray against it but the opportunity to ensure that prayer result in debate be almost non existent that be theoretical rather than practical constraint one of the issue have be try to raise be order sir christopher be parliamentarian with enough experience to know that that be very very long intervention he have be here from the start he could have choose to contribute in the debate thank my hon friend for the intervention this be clearly an area that he be very passionate about if these proposal progress be sure that he will be able to feed into they well we have be hear about the affirmative procedure versus the negative procedure the affirmative procedure have prove particularly cumbersome when unexpected event arise when our lionesses reach the world cup final with just four day notice as we have hear the parliamentary process nearly prevent community from come together to celebrate even my community in scotland would have have the opportunity to do so if they have be in the same situation move to the negative procedure would allow the government to respond swiftly to such moment while maintain parliamentary oversight this change do not weaken democratic oversight at all it simply make the process more efficient the secretary of state must still consult appropriately under section and public consultation will continue as we have hear any member of either house retain the right to table prayer motion for the annulment of the order and judicial review remain available the benefit be clear parliamentary time spend on uncontested order can be reallocate to generally contentious matter by make small sensible change like this we free up valuable time to debate critical issue face our country such as secure our energy supply support rural and coastal community tackle neighbourhood crime and hold this government to account the conservative party be and always will be the party of business we understand that the ability to open for long during national celebration can provide significant and welcome boost of energy and income to our pub bar restaurant and high street this bill facilitate that in more efficient manner we support the bill because it be common sense practical measure that continue to champion the work we do in government and because it will help business and community across all our constituency in conclusion as this be thoroughly logical piece of legislation which remove unnecessary procedural step and allow the house to well focus on its primary responsibility we support it and commend it to the house rise to speak only because be not able to complete my intervention as you rightly say madam deputy speaker it be get very long the point want to make in my short contribution to this debate be that it be because of the lack of flexibility in the negative procedure that we find ourselves have to discuss the matter on third reading today if the house have the ability to amend statutory instrument and have guarantee more or less that if there be an objection to an order make under the negative procedure it could be the subject of debate there would be less concern about order be subject to the negative procedure rather than the affirmative procedure this bill have be drag through this house at great length do not quite understand the explanation for that under the bill in the narrow context of sporting event take place that result in the need for celebration that there have not be notice of at time when the house be sit accord to the bill sponsor it would be relevant only in such circumstance the government could allow licensing extension claim to move the closure standing order no as we have not yet hear from the minister be not prepared to take closure motion at this time in the light of the number of people who vote at am think it be highly unlikely that any closure motion could be carry because it would need member to support it have be speak for only two or three minute know the hon member for newton abbot martin wrigley be keen to get on and discuss his bill which know the government wish to talk out be little bit perplexed about that the negative resolution procedure would be necessary only in an emergency be quite tempt to extend my remark because the hon member for watford matt turmaine try to link the content of the bill with today first anniversary of the election of what think be undeniably the bad government this country have ever experience would we really have want to celebrate that in the pub last night be commiserate with group of conservatives in london constituency about what have happen over the last year and explain to they that they should take courage from the fact that at least we be of the way through this ghastly government my remark be entirely orient around the suggestion that those wish to celebrate would be able to do so no compulsion to do so be intend be so relieved to hear that as believer in freedom and choice think people should have the chance to go to the pub either to celebrate or to commiserate share the desire of the hon gentleman and many other in this house to promote the hospitality industry there seem to be some evidence that lot more young people be come back to drink and celebrate in pub and long may that continue in my constituency as in many other far too many good pub and other hospitality venue have close down not least because of the government imposition of extra employer national insurance and increase in the national minimum wage although the government will probably take credit for allow this bill this very modest measure to go through it need to be put in perspective at the same time they have be the author of whole lot of measure that have be very bad news for the hospitality industry across the country and in christchurch in particular be grateful to my hon friend the member for watford matt turmaine and to other who speak in the debate include my hon friend the member for portsmouth north amanda martin for their contribution thank my hon friend the member for watford for speak on behalf of my hon friend the member for wrexham andrew ranger who introduce the bill and be grateful to be speak on behalf of the minister for policing and crime prevention my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson throughout proceeding on the bill there have be high degree of consensus on the measure it contain and be pleased to say that the government fully support it recognise the depth of experience that my hon friend the member for wrexham bring to it with his plus year in the hospitality sector rightly the bill support the sector which be responsible for around million job in our country and be an important part of our local and national economy as my hon friend the member for watford explain section of the licensing act make provision for the secretary of state to make an order that relax license hour in england and wales on an occasion of exceptional international national or local significance in practice the home secretary determine whether an occasion meet the criterion on case by case basis and any order that be bring forward must specify the date and time of the relaxation such order benefit business which can stay open for long community which can come together to celebrate important event and licensing authority which do not have to process large number of individual licence extension of course it be still for individual business to decide whether they wish to take advantage of any extension but if business do wish to stay open blanket licensing extension mean that individual business do not have to give temporary event notice to their local authority save they time as well as the associate fee the bill will amend the licensing act so that relaxation order can be make via the negative resolution procedure rather than the current affirmative procedure in the past we have relax licensing hour for high profile royal event such as her late majesty the queen platinum jubilee and the coronation of his majesty the king other event of significant national importance such as the recent celebration on the anniversary of ve day and major sporting event include the final of the man european championship football tournament in and and the woman european championship this summer let summarise the benefit of change the procedure first by remove the need for business to submit individual temporary event notice and subsequently for local authority to work tirelessly in process they we will reduce the burden place on those organisation hospitality venue will also have one few administrative task to process as they prepare for event secondly as have previously mention more practical reason for make this change be that as well as be use for royal occasion for which there be plenty of notice licensing extension can be use when one of our national football team make it to the final of tournament give the nature of how these competition play out there be very little time between the team qualify for key match and the match take place in the summer of the england man team make it to the final of the delay euro tournament thankfully with the help of colleague of different party we be able to swiftly put an order in place in the three day between the semi final and the final in the summer of however the england woman team reach the final of the world cup which take place when parliament be in recess as such it be not possible to extend licensing hour change the process to the negative procedure will mean that an order can be make when parliament be in recess so that we can avoid such situation arise again history have show that there be clearly cross party support for this measure which be important to colleague on both side of the house have outline the benefit of be able to make order swiftly will briefly make some remark about how the government will consider what need to be in place when use the power we be clear that the government must continue to plan ahead so that wherever possible license hour extension order can be make in time for prior public consultation it be also important to make it clear that the police have generally be supportive of extension for royal event and that no noticeable issue have be attribute to extended drinking hour indeed many people might like to drink non alcoholic beverage which be available in almost all pub and restaurant across the country the government recognise the importance of provide the police with ample time to put in place any additional police measure that may be necessary to prevent an increase in crime or disorder in our community and we make sure that their view on these matter be hear in advance to that end the government remain firmly committed to continue to plan in advance wherever possible the power in section of the licensing act have be use sparingly and rightly so as the statutory guidance that accompany the licensing act set out it should normally be possible for those apply for premise licence to anticipate special occasion the change will apply to england and wales only once again thank my hon friend the member for wrexham and other who have speak in support of this important new measure question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass company directors duties bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time under current uk law company

the hon member for newton abbot martin wrigley on introduce the bill and on squeeze in his remark under the wire he make some important observation clearly we do not have the time we would like to explore the provision in more detail but understand that will be engage with he rise may have anticipate the hon member intervention will be engage with he shortly on the bill provision it be not bill that the government will be able to support but do want to have further conversation with he about it it be important that we recognise director duty for what they be cornerstone of uk company law

smith rise to discuss service for adult with learn difficulty and disability in hillingdon approximately million people in england have learn disability if we include those with learn difficulty that figure be even high yet too often our service education system nhs workplace and society as whole be not inclusive of their need and they be often see as an afterthought be motivate to bring forward this adjournment debate have recently have the privilege of meet many adult with learn disability and difficulty and their family in the borough of hillingdon they express to that again they feel like an afterthought as they be appal by the council recent decision to close another vital service for adult many other service have be close move or cut in recent year before turn to the specific important service that have be lose or be under threat it be important to note that of course many good organisation be work hard in challenge circumstance to provide support in the nhs the hillingdon community team for people with learn disability provide specialist support for adult with learn disability in the community and across primary and secondary care those service however be largely around diagnosis and access to medical support just one aspect of an adult need dash voluntary sector group offer range of sporting and recreational activity for people with disability all focus on encourage people to socialise but it too have struggle with decrease funding in recent year hillingdon autistic care and support provide an autism hub advice and social activity for adult in the london borough of hillingdon but the slashing of its budget in lead to the closure of the popular tea room café open to the public that offer training and work support to adult with autism unfortunately that be sign of even more damaging cut to come follow those proposal an petition sign by people call on the council not to withdraw the funding for the tea room despite that the council press ahead claim that people benefit from training and support be not good value for money disappointing sign of thing to come with council know the price of everything but the value of nothing more broadly in the area of education the park view centre part of the orchard hill college group near uxbridge have range of on site vocational opportunity the college do excellent work in challenge facility that be not purpose build recently have the privilege of meet number of their learner and staff and they show at first hand how much they have to offer our community and workplace as well as insist attend their next disco their overwhelming message be that they love their job coach holly but unfortunately there be only one holly in the whole of the college they want more work coach placement internship and job coach support yes learning be vital but they want it to lead somewhere in adult life they want real workplace experience and ideally full time or part time role the government commitment to invest more than billion into workplace support for those with disability be welcome step forward hope that the department of health and social care and the department for work and pensions will work together to ensure that this investment be also target to help adult with learn difficulty get the support they desperately need datum suggest that the employment gap for people with learn disability be still far too wide of the people access long term social care only of those with learn disability be in pay work which be shame on our society charity have previously call on the government to set new ambitious target for reduce the disability employment gap with strategic action behind it previous secretary of state for work and pensions say in march that he would set new disability employment goal but progress have be slow and hope the two departments can work together to progress that such gap be why support work placement centre for training and volunteering be vital follow the closure of the hillingdon tea room another such facility be now under threat there be strong community lead campaign to save the rural activities garden centre which provide employment opportunity skill lifelong relationship and connection to our community for adult with learn difficulty across west london conservative lead hillingdon council take the decision just last week to slash that vital service have be shock and sadden to see how the voice of adult with learn difficulty and their family have be silence in this discussion not even be allow to speak or question the decision at the civic centre we be now in this chamber and we can ensure that their voice and story be hear number of they be in the gallery with their family george be he be separate from his parent at birth due to their inability to care for he at that time he have spend year unable to eat without feeding tube and have battle self harm throughout his life after decade of struggle for specialist support four year ago george find something precious community at the rural activities garden centre where he feel value and understand since the announcement and as result of the fear that that vital support system may be strip away george challenge have again become overwhelming oliver have be attend the ragc for year and have complex health need he be partially sight and have severe learn difficulty and chronic kidney disease more recently he have suffer from post traumatic stress disorder oliver battle with mental health impact on his ability to do day to day task and the usual activity that bring he joy but one comfort remain the ragc there be also doug who have have the pleasure to meet he be an adult with learn disability that impact on his ability to read write and count where the private sector be unable to provide support to doug with his additional need the ragc see past what he could not do and nurture what he could it watch he transform from shy young man into confident year old with purpose after the closure meeting doug ask simple but heartbreaking question where do the staff go what happen to and my mate be also tell of georgia story before join ragc she struggle with anxiety and undiagnosed autism leave she imprisoned in her own home the garden centre help she to develop skill and build confidence and she even go on to compete in wreath make competition it be the service now under threat that transform she from someone who could not leave the house to someone who could confidently serve customer what transformation she fear the closure will reignite those same issue that she have work so hard to manage the difficulty of day to day life be often feel more acutely by adult with learn difficulty it be the sanctuary that place such as the ragc provide that make it imperative we continue to fight for their survival the rural activities garden centre make employment opportunity personal development and skill curation accessible for those who be often isolate have meet so many people from right across the community who have volunteer there gain skill and even move into permanent job as result family feel that their loved one be care for safe and nurture in this space and it have give carer and family their own ability to have respite and time to care for themselves congratulate the hon member on secure this debate he will know that the garden centre also provide an essential service to my constituent have visit the place for either or year be not clear and it be commend by the former conservative leader of hillingdon council who call it jewel in the crown that be why it have come as such shock that this conservative administration be now willing to close it with such brutality do the hon member agree that the council should even at this late stage think again and consult properly include all those volunteer and parent as well as the people who use the centre to look at wide range of option this do not have to happen now the council just need to listen to we concur completely with my right hon friend we have both meet those affect their love one and their family and we can really hear and see the value unfortunately that value be not consider in the rush decision make by the councillor will turn to the lack of consultation very soon and completely agree with he about that it be not too late and like he hope that the council think again the rural activities garden centre be another in long list of closure at the hand of the local council follow year of financial mismanagement by the leadership the modus operandi have become to cut through its crisis while the council cabinet see nothing more than line on spreadsheet behind this move be adult with learn difficulty whose life have be transform by this service and who risk lose it all as result of the council decision by its own admission it view the decision of the closure through the lens of profit failure to turn profit mean inevitable closure to hillingdon council that be the reason quote at the recent decision make meeting but should social service have to make profit to survive to it defeat the objective of those service by that logic one wonder what will be cut next by hillingdon council what other social service or school will it have in its sight this heartless approach to community service aside hillingdon council binary decision making in relation to profit be economically flawed these service be not cost they be investment in the future the national audit office calculate that support someone with moderate learning disability in residential care cost million over their lifetime with proper community support such as the ragc that drop by million we save money while give people the dignity purpose and independence they deserve perhaps the council inability to understand this basic economic principle of investment and return shed some light on why it be about to go bankrupt receive damn report from its own chief financial officer still hillingdon council dismiss the ragc as merely retail service tell that to george doug oliver or georgia tell the family who have watch their love one transform from isolation to independence that this be retail service recognise that there be similar story across the country unfortunately scatter service break up community and destroy what work for short term saving that create long term cost with our most vulnerable community always the first to feel the brunt the rural activities garden centre work its client thrive their family be support the evidence be overwhelming but evidence mean nothing without political will and political will mean nothing without adequate funding we be not ask for the impossible we be ask the council and this government to back choice and independence for adult with learn difficulty and care package and to recognise that support employment be not luxury to be cut when time be tough it be vital investment that pay dividend in human dignity and economic return for national and local government the rural activities garden centre must be save service like it across england must be protect the people who depend on they deserve nothing less than our absolute commitment to their dignity their potential and their right to belong appreciate the minister give up her time to be here today with so many press issue across the health and care system there be some specific issue hope she will take away for further consideration first and local family would like to welcome the minister to hillingdon to meet disabled adult and those with learn difficulty to hear their experience of fragmented system and council and nhs not work together as well as they could and should which hope could inform the broad review of social care take place nationally secondly the women and equalities committee report in on inequality for people with learn disability outline clearly that people with learn disability and those who care for they be the real expert when it come to their health and care need however aside from the occasional opportunity to feed into consultation far too often their voice be miss when it come to decision making at both local and national level their live experience should be well reflect in effort to reduce health inequality and improve outcome hope the government will look at how they can embed co production and meaningful engagement in decision making on care package and service and ensure that those with care package and support be genuinely consult and engage in any service change there must also be clear guidance for provider and commissioner of service about consultation and full equality impact assessment be conduct before service be change which have be woefully lack in this case thirdly the nhs year plan launch yesterday include welcome announcement about support people with health budget give people personal health plan and shift to prevention and community base work for the nhs will the minister address whether we can and should expect the same principle to lead work on adult social care support too fourthly on enable joint working the public accounts committee report in local support for people with learn disability find that people with learn disability who live in the community have patchy access to healthcare and limited opportunity to participate in the community for example by have job while the department have the policy lead for people with learn disability and care plan responsibility for their support span across government we even find that to be the case when discuss which department should respond to this debate responsibility cross the department of health and social care the department for education the department for work and pensions and the ministry of housing communities and local government in its report the public accounts committee recommend that government should set out cross government strategy for improve access to health care and opportunity for adult with learn disability to participate in the community include employment as well as how it will measure the effectiveness of this strategy hope we can return to this in future because clearly all these department bear some oversight and responsibility for this important group of the population lastly hope the minister will join in thank oliver doug george and georgia as well as all the service user and their family for build this project from scratch many decade ago plant the first tree build the first planter volunteer to keep it go in difficult time and create this amazing life change project and now also for their campaign to fight for its survival hope that hillingdon council will think again take the time to genuinely listen and get the decision right work with the community in the absence of that hope the government will prioritise adult with learn difficulty in service like this one we be elect year ago today on manifesto of change invest in people transform life chance and provide everyone with opportunity these be the thing that the rural activities garden centre and so many other service in hillingdon have do and can continue to do for countless people in the borough of hillingdon thank my hon friend the member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales for secure this debate around service in the community for people with learn difficulty in hillingdon and for champion the right of people with learn difficulty in his area welcome those in the gallery who be here to demonstrate how important service for people with learn difficulty in hillingdon be to they join my hon friend in pay particular tribute to oliver doug george and georgia for all their work in this area be aware that as member of the health and social care committee my hon friend have keen interest in health and social care matter he will therefore be pleased to know that the government have today publish their response to the health and social care committee report adult social care reform the cost of inaction be sorry to hear that hillingdon council have decide to close the rural activities garden centre but as member know decision on local service be for council to make since they be well place to understand and meet the need of their local population fully appreciate the point that the minister make but will she take advice from colleague in other departments on the follow specific point my hon friend the member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales and have be work with different group and we have seek to register under relevant legislation the rural activities garden centre as community asset which would force the local authority to properly consult with we and to engage with the wide community the council be go ahead with the decision to sell or close in advance of even consider whether it should be community asset will she help we by take advice from whichever department be relevant about whether or not there be anything we can do as government to ensure that hillingdon council abide by the legislation that be pass to protect community asset such as this one will ensure that that issue be raise with the relevant department will say little more about some of the expectation we place on local authority to shape their care market to meet the diverse need of all local people as require under the care act this government recognise the vital importance of co production and work with people who draw on care and support to ensure local authority be meet these duty the care quality commission be assess local adult social care service by publish full report and overall performance rating for each local authority hillingdon have be rat as good in the cqc recent assessment but the report also include feedback on area where the cqc conclude that hillingdon could improve it be great to be have this discussion today on the last day of co production week an important annual awareness campaign to recognise the benefit of work in equal partnership with people use health and social care provision local council should absolutely involve engage and consult adult with learn difficulty on their care plan as well as on wide decision that affect their care and support and their life in general we be committed to encourage genuine co production between social care professional local authority policymaker and crucially people who draw on care and support to design system that work well for everyone one that be fair inclusive and put people first the government
