on high street and in town centre what step her department be take to help tackle antisocial behaviour on high street and in town centre what step she be take to improve safety in town centre too many town centre and high street have be hit in recent year by soar level of shoplifting and street crime and damage antisocial behaviour at the same time as neighbourhood police have be heavily cut the government be introduce new power to tackle antisocial behaviour and shop crime and rebuild neighbourhood police on our street too often in recent year antisocial behaviour have blight our high street with people in clwyd east feel unsafe when they be out in their local community we know that neighbourhood police work in prestatyn the recent work of north wales police to combat antisocial behaviour at the retail centre have lead to positive youth engagement and criminal charge do the home secretary agree that rather than write off such offence as low level and leave community to deal with they

be not fund by the previous conservative government we be also support neighbourhood police right across the country and much strong action not just on shop theft but on assault against shop worker truly disgraceful crime as former police and crime commissioner for lancashire work very closely with the last government on operation centurion which be about really focus in on antisocial behaviour through more visible patrol and well partnership work we know that lot of antisocial behaviour be egg on by very small minority and some of the most serious crime relate to antisocial behaviour be drive by that small minority without restrict freedom ban order do not work and engagement with youth offend team do not work because they be all voluntary what measure do the government intend to bring in as part of their new zero tolerance zone that will be different from what currently exist to make it really zero tolerance the hon member be right that sometimes it be small minority who be make life total nightmare for everyone else the current antisocial behaviour injunction just be not strong enough because very often they do not come with power of arrest that be why we be introduce respect order which mean that repeat perpetrator can be ban from town centre they will have power of arrest so that swift action can be take if they be breach antisocial behaviour and crime on our high street be well tackle with visible police presence but police officer in my constituency be spend four hour round trip take those they be arrest to worthe custody centre when we have perfectly fit for purpose custody centre in chichester do the home secretary agree that open chichester custody centre would reduce the time that police officer spend sit in traffic and get they back on our

commissioner of the metropolitan police on what they be do to reduce these incident and make our street safe across london the hon member be right to refer to the issue around antisocial and criminal

agree with jonathan hall he be absolutely right our overriding priority will always be to ensure that the victim of crime get justice and we will look at how good that can be achieve retail crime what step her department be take to help tackle shoplifting and violence against shop worker what step her department be take to help tackle shoplifting and violence against shop worker what step she be take to help tackle retail crime in the last year of the previous government shop theft reach record high and we see intolerable level of abuse against shop worker leave people fearful of go to work

their crime my constituency team and recently visit shop on one of the busy high street in my constituency of the first we visit nine say that their staff have suffer attack at work and all say that shoplifting be now pretty much daily occurrence do the minister agree that extra resource and extra policing be part of the answer but that we should also be look at programme such as offender to rehab scheme one of which have be roll out in the west midland to make sure we be also tackle the cause of retail crime my hon friend paint deeply upsetting and unacceptable picture of the impact that aggressive and repeat shop theft can have on retail worker the bad thing be that we know that it be replicate up and down the entire country we can not continue like this that be why we be determined to take the action that have set out in previous answer but agree that we have to look at issue around rehabilitation for offender include treatment for addiction where appropriate bath be very popular tourist and shopping destination but it have also see the high increase in shoplifting offence between and for my shopkeeper to feel safe they want much more visible police presence in bath what can the government do for they the hon lady be absolutely right shop theft go up by in the previous year which be totally unacceptable and hear very clearly what she say about her constituency of bath that be why the neighbourhood police model that this labour government stand on at the general election be so important for start to deal with shop theft which as we have just be talk about have become an epidemic the home secretary have repeatedly reiterate her pledge to tackle shoplifting and violence against shop worker by have name officer in each community as part of the uplift for neighbourhood police speak to cambridgeshire constabulary recently which confirm that under the home secretary plan there would be one police officer to cover the whole town of st ives that officer would cover not only st ives but the town of ramsey and all the village in between woodhurst old hurst pidley warboys wistow and bury last week the policing minister would not commit to review the police allocation formula to ensure cambridgeshire receive its fair share of funding how can one officer be expect to cover such large area effectively give that cambridgeshire be likely to receive only handful of the officer say gently to the hon member that he have to look at what this government inherit from his conservative government after year during which neighbourhood policing be repeatedly cut this government be commit to restore neighbourhood policing we have say that we will bring in police officer police community support officer and special when the shadow home secretary be shout when at we be work on this as quickly as we can five month in after year of what the conservatives do to our policing shoplifting be often organise by criminal gang and norfolk police have have some success in fight they do the minister recognise that partnership such as operation wonderland which have just be launch by west norfolk police alongside the local council cctv operator street ranger and shop worker be key to tackle this crime and make sure offender be bring to justice the hon gentleman make very important point police alone can not deal with this crime we need to work hand in hand with business as well as the trade union usdaw have be very important in the campaign for the offence of assault shop worker that we be go to bring in have also meet the british retail consortium and will chair regular forum with the retail sector to make sure we be share good practice we be go to deal with the problem we have inherit call the shadow minister one of the good way to help tackle retail crime be to put more police on the street the last conservative government do just the last conservative government do just that deliver record number of police with more funding than ever before but we be not stop there this year the conservative government increase frontline police funding by million will the minister commit to matching or even improve that figure next year do not know if it be just amnesia on that side of the house but think the shadow minister need to reflect on what we actually inherit pcso cut by special down by two third and over police officer cut under the conservative administration so little bit of humility about what they have leave we with would go down very well afghan citizens resettlement scheme what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the afghan citizen resettlement scheme we be determined to honour our commitment to those who support we in afghanistan and who stand up for freedom and democracy place their own life at risk to date the afghan scheme have bring over people to safety in the uk include thousand through the afghan citizen resettlement scheme we aim to continue to relocate

the beat with few crime solve and real sense in community that more criminal be get away with it this government be determined to turn that around start with get police back on the beat and rebuild neighbourhood policing early this month hold community meeting in dinnington about the regeneration project on the high street it be well attend and people be optimistic but they be also worried about the lack of police in the area and the crime that continue to blight their town can the home secretary reassure the resident of dinnington that this government will rebuild community policing which be utterly let down over year of conservative government my hon friend be exactly right the percentage of people see police on the beat each week have drop by two third over the past year the percentage of people who say they never see the police have double that be the shameful consequence of year of conservative policing policy this government will put more police and police community support officer back on the beat local volunteer in potters bar be leave struggle on remembrance sunday to stop the traffic to allow the march to take place they be tell by the police that they lack the resource and the power to stop the traffic yet on the same day in neighbour essex the police manage to visit journalist regard delete tweet every weekend vast amount of resource pour into london for pro palestinian march do the home secretary share the despair of my constituent at this allocation of resource and will she provide guidance for next year remembrance service both on police power and the responsibility regard those march just point out to the former deputy prime minister that the state of police in this country be the policing that we inherit after year of conservative government in which they take police off the beat and in which we lose neighbourhood policing and pcso this government have make clear what the priority for policing should be neighbourhood policing include tackle antisocial behaviour and town centre crime and reduce serious violence include knife crime and violence against woman and girl we always believe that remembrance day should be respect which be something that one of his former colleague as home secretary do not respect call the act shadow minister more than non crime hate incident have be log by uk police force in the past year include against schoolchildren as young as nine for classroom insult this be estimate to have take hour of police time and undermine public trust and confidence in police the last government tighten the guidance and it have be widely report this morning that the home secretary will update it again how will the right hon lady know if her change have work what be the metric and be there target if the change do not work will she restrict investigation to take place only when there be an imminent risk of an actual crime welcome the hon member to her act role be not sure how long she be act for we have make clear what we believe the priority should be for policing neighbourhood police and reduce serious violence on our street and that should be the case across the board we should have common sense approach to police decision in every area across the country on the issue she raise the inspectorate have recently do report which find inconsistency in whole series of area we believe that its recommendation need to be take immensely seriously by force across the country online safety child what step her department be take to help keep child safe online there be nothing more important for the government than keep our child safe that be why be appal by the volume of child abuse that be proliferate online and why we be determined to act we be committed to robust implementation of the online safety act which contain strong protection for child but we will not hesitate to go far if tech company fail to play their part our investment in the national crime agency gchq an undercover online network of police officer and the tackle organise exploitation programme be support our effort to keep child safe online by target and stop the high harm and most technically sophisticated offender greatly welcome the action that the government be take but the fight against child sex abuse online be only as strong as its weak link and facebook decision to allow the encrypt sharing of image make it very weak link indeed do the minister share my anger that facebook appear to be turn blind eye while its platform become safe haven for paedophile my hon friend raise an extremely serious issue assure he that we very much share his concern the home secretary have meet representative from meta and our official be in regular contact what we say in all those discussion be very simple for year meta have be an industry leader when it come to prevent and detect child sex abuse online and what we all want to see be it continue to play that positive role and not as my hon friend fear go in the opposite direction my constituent lose his son to suicide follow exposure to an online suicide forum he be sadly one of know britons the young of whom be just whose death have be link to this one site under the online safety act the technology secretary have the power to include such small but very dangerous site under category the most heavily regulate category but ofcom have advise he against do so will the minister press her colleague in the department for science innovation and technology to include these exceptionally dangerous site in category pay tribute to the hon member constituent it be unimaginable for any parent to have to go through something like that we at the home office be work incredibly closely with our dsit colleague as the online safety act come into force to ensure that it be as strong and robust as it can be we be have those conversation daily violence against women and girl what step her department be take to tackle violence against woman and girl what step her department be take with police force to tackle violence against woman and girl what support she be provide to local organisation to help tackle violence against woman and girl the scale of violence against woman and girl in our country be intolerable and the government will treat it as national emergency as part of this mission we be bring together minister from right across government so that every department do its bit from prevention work in school through to relentless pursuit of dangerous perpetrator on top of that work we have already begin strengthen the police response to domestic abuse we will mark the next day of activism with further announcement on our work to tackle spike stalk and other vawg crime charity such as aylesbury women aid do brilliant and vital work to support survivor of domestic abuse however when these survivor interact with other public face service such as emergency or healthcare service they be not always meet with the same level of understanding what measure be the minister take to ensure that survivor of domestic violence and abuse be meet with trauma inform approach across all public service massive thank you to aylesbury women aid for the amazing work that it be clearly do be afraid that my hon friend and victim be exactly right in their assessment that be why we must have completely cross government approach to ensure that no matter where victim stand up all service take responsibility for their role in the life of those who be suffer as the hon member for stourbridge cat eccles point out coercive control be criminal offence but it be often overlook despite research suggest that it be the third high risk factor in domestic homicide in my surgery in esher and walton victim have tell that there be not sufficient understanding of coercive control in police interview particularly when other crime be be investigate what assessment be be make of the effectiveness of the roll out of the domestic abuse risk assessment dara toolkit which be introduce by the college of policing in number of different risk assessment tool be use whether dara or dash the domestic abuse stalking harassment and honour base violence risk assessment which have more historical grounding and be use more widely want the hon lady to know that it be impossible to read any domestic homicide review in our country for the past decade and not think that risk assessment and how well they be use and operate be something that we should look at will the minister join in thank the incredible staff at the sandycroft centre in my constituency who offer life save support for vulnerable people in time of crisis will she visit the centre with to hear from ceo lee mckenzie and the independent sexual violence adviser who be on the frontline tackle increase violence against woman and girl as it be very local to take particular interest in the sandycroft centre such centre be invaluable to vulnerable woman and would be delighted to visit he and lee it would be minute drive do the minister agree that local charity like jasmine house which operate in my constituency play vital role in support woman who have be victim of sexual crime but in addition to the worry of constantly try to find funding they be concerned about the impact that the government propose increase in employer national insurance will have on their ability to continue provide that help do the minister agree that they should be exempt from the change to national insurance contribution pay tribute to jasmine house as someone who apply for funding for similar centre understand exactly the funding pressure that its staff will face what the sector really need be stability the assurance of more than single year funding which the government be look at and make sure that we mitigate to ensure that there be enough topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility today be the international day for the elimination of violence against women it mark the start of day of global activism on the issue as part of the labour government safe street mission we have set an ambition to halve violence against woman and girl which hope everyone will be part of today we be set out new action to tackle the devastating crime of spiking with new stand alone criminal offence to strengthen the police response new specialist training for bar and door staff across the country and new recording measure because we fear that the prevalence be much high than have be previously think and the dangerous criminal responsible need to be catch and stop as we look forward to the festive season everyone should be able to enjoy night out without have to worry about the safety of their drink and whether they will be able to get home safely meet constituent at my coffee morning in southall green on friday who raise the constant issue of open drug dealing and antisocial behaviour in the town centre will the secretary of state work with the mayor of london to ensure that we have more police on the street of southall and london as soon as we can my hon friend make an important point we have already give the met an additional million this year on top of what it be previously allocate we also need to ensure that here and right across the country we have neighbourhood police back in town centre because that be how to tackle not just local drug dealing but antisocial behaviour and other crime that blight community call the shadow home secretary let start by offer the home secretary belate congratulation on her appointment have be minister in that department know how difficult her job be and genuinely wish she well in do it we will always seek to work constructively with the government in the national interest also associate myself with the remark she make about international vawg day international day for the elimination of violence against women and girl since the election people have dangerously and illegally cross the channel increase on the same period last year why do the right hon lady think the number have go up so much on her watch thank the shadow home secretary for his opening word think he describe his time in the home office as his good ministerial job ever give that he be chief secretary to the treasury under liz truss we can perhaps wonder why he be also the immigration minister who remind he tell the commons and the select committee that he would not rule out use giant wave machine as the way to stop small boat crossing we inherit record high level of small boat crossing in the first half of this year we have take action to fix the previous government chaos be ask the home secretary about her record be ask the home secretary why small boat crossing have go up during her time in office perhaps it be because as the national crime agency say we need deterrent yet she cancel the rwanda deterrent before it even start now we hear ursula von der leyen the european commission president ask european member state to look at offshore processing be that not why it have go up be that not why the minister for border security and asylum admit last week that she be open new hotel instead of close they down seriously what lot of chaos high level on record that be the six month of the last conservative government while the right hon gentleman be in government in fact the number since the summer be not the high on record that unfortunately be his legacy while he be the immigration minister he increase the number of asylum hotel by and increase the number of people in asylum hotel by over seriously he should not try to give lecture to anybody else at all well be go to give little lecture if you really want to attack each other can you do it before we get to topical question these question be mean to be short and sweet because otherwise other member will not get in specialist domestic abuse service such as the first step in knowsley be face an increase in demand but be have to turn people away due to lack of funding what more can minister do to support such service have visit the first step and to say that it be run by brilliant merseyside woman would be an underestimation specialist by and for service play an essential role and provide tailor support to victim and survivor we understand the challenge that the sector face in particular with the level of demand their service be currently face all decision on funding after march be subject to the spending review process call the liberal democrat spokesperson we all want to stop criminal terrorise our community whether they be domestic abuser or shoplifter target our high street live facial recognition be be roll out by our police force include on sutton high street in my constituency but we can not ignore the risk that this technology present facial recognition system be most likely to misidentify black people and woman do nothing to stop crime and far erode trust in our police will the minister introduce clear regulation oversight of live facial recognition such as that which the eu pass last april this be another area where the new incoming labour government be have to look at power and measure bring in by the previous government live facial recognition can have very positive effect but we need to consider whether we need framework around it that be why will be host series of roundtable before christmas to discuss with stakeholder the way forward on this technology the national audit office recently raise serious concern about the previous government decision to buy poor quality expensive and contaminate asylum accommodation at northeye what step be the department take to ensure that asylum accommodation be fit for purpose and represent value for money my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this issue what the national audit office find in its report be not only an appalling process of decision making by member of the previous government but grotesque waste of million of taxpayer money just like the waste of million at raf scampton in contrast the new government be determined to cut asylum accommodation cost by step up decision making reduce the backlog order gregory stafford and increase return order it be the back benchers who do not get in transnational repression by iran china russia and other unfriendly nation continue to be writ large on diaspora population in this country what be the government strategy on transnational repression and will the home secretary reintroduce the last government defend democracy taskforce to monitor incidence the hon gentleman make good point the taskforce be examine closely the threat that he raise and we shall have more to say about that shortly be sure that the home secretary would agree that good government be transparent government have be tell by her department in response to write parliamentary question that the number of crime commit by illegal migrant be not available through publish statistic be sure that the home office do hold the datum so will the minister commit to publish it in full there will be huge drop of immigration relate national statistic at the end of the week two brave woman from maltby come to my most recent surgery each tell about the horrific physical and emotional abuse that they have suffer at the hand of their ex partner they also tell that the police have ignore non molestation order which as know from my professional experience before be call to the bar be far from uncommon what step will the government take to ensure that any relevant court order be give due force my hon friend make an important point there be serious problem of injunction non molestation order and protection order not be treat properly that be why we be introduce raneem law which include strong protection order and specialist in control room chelmsford allocation of dispersal accommodation for asylum seeker be more than bed but the number find to date be about tenth of that number owe to the high demand for and high cost of private rent accommodation in the district what extra support can the minister offer council face the increase cost of housing asylum seeker we be try to co operate much more with local authority so that we can deal with these issue but ultimately the way to deal with they be to get the backlog down and get people out of high price accommodation so that we can integrate they if they be grant asylum have meet number of british palestinian family who be try to reunite with their family in gaza part of the entry clearance process require the undertaking of biometric there be no visa centre in gaza and they be unable to leave owe to the closure of the rafah crossing will the home secretary or the minister please indicate whether they be willing to introduce temporary waiver for biometric so that people can complete the entry clearance process the death and destruction in gaza be intolerable palestinians who wish to join family member in the uk must do so via the range of exist route that be available but if my hon friend wish to raise specific matter with shall be happy to meet she what step be the minister take to tackle crime in rural area as say early have meet representative of the agricultural engineers association to discuss the implementation of the secondary legislation that be require to deal with the theft of agricultural equipment and be also have meeting with the rural crime unit to discuss some of the specific however the neighbourhood policing guarantee apply in rural area just as much as in urban area which be important my constituent tracy set up the organisation change be make in memory of her grandson cameron hamilton who be fatally stab in bournemouth town centre last year tracy believe deeply in the power of education and positive activity to tackle knife crime and be campaign for youth hub in the constituency can the home secretary update we on the progress be make towards the roll out of network of youth hub and will she support tracy campaign pay tribute to my hon friend constituent tracy for campaign in memory of cameron too many young life be be lose that be why we be set up the young futures programme with youth hub but also prevention partnership to work across the country in recent week the number of channel crossing have be far high than the home office expect which be why we have see ministers rapidly approve new asylum hotel we be tell that the situation be temporary because asylum claim be apparently now be process fast and people be be move through accommodation fast too what reassurance can the home secretary give my constituent that the fast processing of asylum claim with no deterrent in the system will not simply act as massive incentive for more people to come here on small boat have to tell the hon member that unfortunately the previous government cut asylum decision make by in the run up to the election and they take away caseworker that be why the backlog be soar we have now put caseworker back in place so that we can start clear the backlog because asylum hotel be cost the taxpayer huge amount of money disabled woman be almost three time more likely to experience domestic abuse and almost twice as likely to report sexual violence do the minister agree that it be important for not only her department but the police to work with disabled woman lead organisation to understand the intersection with gender base violence and the double whammy that affect disabled woman my hon friend be absolutely right pay tribute to stay safe east one of very few specialist disability and domestic abuse charity without by and for service we simply would not be serve most of the woman in our country who need support report publish today show that hour be take up each year investigate non crime hate incident do the minister agree that confidence in the police could be restore if they prioritise their time and resource to investigate actual crime rather than hurt feeling this government have make very clear what our priority be around safe street and where the focus should be for police on halve knife crime and halve violence against woman and girl over the next decade the home secretary have also be very clear that common sense approach must be take to non crime hate incident

game in the garden on day when the prime minister be out of the country on business an important call come through that john have to take and we pause our game to this day have no idea who it be or what be say but the conversation clearly distract john so much that when he arrive back he hit the ball with such force that it bounce right off the table and hit the ministerial car from that experience can assure the house that the left hook still pack mighty punch in the year after john leave office would often drive he back to the station at newark or doncaster after his many visit to mansfield so he could get the train to london or back home to hull the insight from his frank and honest recollection of history from the blair and brown year will stay with for very long time may he rest in peace far to that point of order mr speaker when first arrive in the house it be common in the conservative party the thatcherite conservative party say to my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh to view john prescott as public enemy no it be an act that he love play into in public at least that be say outside the studio or the chamber he be friendly and helpful certainly to indeed he be almost the good possible constituency neighbour one could want john prescott be quintessentially working class hero an identity that suspect the current deputy prime minister also adopt of course he be brilliant constituency ally and forceful defender of the interest of the people of hull with the emphasis on force however he be also necessary champion of the new labour party the prime minister refer implicitly to the fact that john prescott deliver one man one vote we should remember that it be an act of huge courage for he to take on his own union ally think at about one hour notice and persuade they to support the neophyte tony blair frankly despite the snobbery of the london establishment about john prescott education it be very unwise person who underestimate his intellect he be formidable and brilliant innovator on be look at the environment secretary the environment on europe on devolution and on whole range of thing he be what we would all hope to be not creature of history but changer of history for that we should always admire he to put to one side all those grand thing he be also greatly greatly love by his family on that basis offer my condolence to pauline and the rest of the family far to that point of order mr speaker want to add my own few word to the tribute that have be make and especially to welcome the comment from my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull east karl turner which be so warm and personal john prescott great many achievement his commitment to climate change and other matter have already be speak of he be truly authentic working class hero and somebody who always attract crowd wherever he go he persevere with his famous battle bus through good time and poor one what may sometimes be miss be his commitment to devolution and the great effort he make in the north east of england where he commit to the campaign for north eastern assembly we be not successful on that occasion the referendum be not win but ultimately john legacy prevail in the devolved institution and authority that we have see ever since on personal note want to put on record my thank to john for his personal support to find myself propel on to the shadow front bench little bit prematurely and unexpectedly but he be of great support to in discharge the transport brief he retain such immense knowledge and on every single occasion he offer encouragement for which will be eternally grateful he be true giant of the labour movement we will miss he enormously but his legacy remain too pass on my sincere condolence to pauline and to all his family far to that point of order mr speaker on behalf of the scottish national party pass on our sincere condolence to pauline to john family and to his many friend colleague and comrade right across the labour movement you have lose colossus of man and an inspiration to working class people right across the united kingdom who be encourage by his example to go into politic remember come down here as new mp in and observe the labour front bench titans all of they and all know to the uk public but dominant among they be john prescott and it be john prescott the public want to hear from when he appear on the tv screen the public pay attention and listen to what he have to say he resonate with the british public who hold he in curious affection if what he have could have be bottle be sure we would all take little sup of it today will never forget where be as candidate in when that famous incident come in that the hon member for newport east jessica morden refer to who could think we all know where we be be with bunch of sixth former at husting at brechin high school and one of the senior pupil say to if it like that every day in your political life want bit of that there inspiration for you mr speaker john be huge music fan and great supporter of our music act we could never quite master the jazz that he seem to favour although maybe as tribute to he we will get round to do one of those number but it be something he completely love everyone have talk about john commitment to climate change but there be also his commitment to devolution which few colleague have mention john prescott be the engine who drive that path towards scottish parliament and the regional assembly which will be happen as matter of course with this new labour government john be part of generation that we be sadly begin to lose but he will stand out as one of the true great parliamentarian in this house of the past few decade and we will all miss he dearly far to that point of order mr speaker it be wonderful to hear all the various tribute to john and want to share my own memory of he as some have mention when it come to campaigning his big thing be his battle bus who would not love tour the country eat sweet with martin angus be sure my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner will attest to that have my own memory of john battle bus from after the election he get small group of we together and we tour london as commuter be on their way to work at around or in the morning john be on the tannoy thank they all individually for vote labour and for another five year of labour government watch people literally stop in the street confuse that bus be talk to they only to discover that it be actually the deputy prime minister talk to they be incredible john then take we all to his flat where despite have have no sleep at all he make we bacon sandwich and tea that be john at his good generous indomitable and completely unpredictable john incredible achievement and those of that labour government will stand the test of time he be the cement that keep the broad church of those new labour government together and we will always remember he for that also want to say that last year my father die of alzheimer and it be very difficult in those early day to remember the man who be before that cruel disease take he away really do hope that pauline and john family be listen to the wonderful tribute that be be pay here in this house and around the country so that they can remember the extraordinary man that john be and the extraordinary life that he live far to that point of order mr speaker first collide if that be the right word with john prescott when be shadow secretary of state for transport as he plough on with his integrated transport plan which be one of the centrepiece of the first blair administration find that some of my colleague try to treat john prescott as bit of joke that be mistake yes we tease he about his two jag and he rather love that but he be utterly sincere in what he do passionate and pretty brutal with his opposition opponent when he feel he be on top we clash again over the proposal for regional assembly great campaigner though he be he lose the north east referendum and do not think he ever really forgive for that when require however john could be great statesman he be right to insist on public inquiry into the marchioness disaster which the previous government have refuse to hold and he be right immediately to announce an inquiry into the paddington rail disaster as soon as it happen recall get one of the most surprising telephone call of my political life when have tell the conservative conference that he be right to call that public inquiry and that we should wait for its outcome get call from he to thank for that bit of bipartisanship something even he be capable of when the camera be not look pay tribute to john for that because the cullen inquiry come up with completely new safety regime for rail include rail accident investigation branch for the department for transport we have not have public inquiry into rail accident ever since because of the safety regime that he implement follow the inquiry every survivor of the paddington rail crash and subsequent rail crash be grateful to he for what he do for passenger safety on our railway if for nothing else we should remember he for that send my good wish to john family and to all his friend and colleague on the government benches at this sad time far to that point of order mr speaker will share two particular memory of lord prescott the first be from my time work for the disability charity scope we have decide as campaign team to use the general election to highlight the many obstacle that disabled people face when exercise their democratic right to vote and my campaign colleague devise the polls apart campaign which include special campaign pack for candidate bear in mind that this be in the halcyon day before email campaign pack be something of rarity we print staple and post out hundred of pack to candidate the length and breadth of the uk include one to the labour candidate for kingston upon hull east off it go send second class to our amazement week or so later reply come back say that mr prescott not only support the campaign but have write to all of labour candidate in his capacity as the general election co ordinator instruct they to take the campaign action that our pack suggest more than that when labour be elect few week later he bring forward amendment to the representation of the people act to make it easy for disabled people to exercise their right to vote have meet john prescott few year before that when work for the then member of parliament for streatham the right hon keith hill both john and keith be member of the rmt parliamentary group which be as broad and diverse as its talent be deep ask keith ahead of my remark today if he have any particular memory of john that might share with the house and he tell of one from his time as minister in the office of the deputy prime minister john and keith be due to make presentation on labour housing growth area to the prime minister tony blair in the cabinet room one morning at am at am john be still work on the presentation he decide that he need to know about the rail connection between cambridge and oxford so he phone network rail member can doubtless imagine the startled reaction of the poor network rail official who answer that call at in the morning from someone claim to be the deputy prime minister who have very specific question about east west rail link tony blair be equally amazed at am and do he tell you what the rail connection be ask the pm there be any reply go to change that now thank to the budget that change will finally be deliver fitting tribute perhaps to the work ethic energy and enthusiasm for change that john prescott exemplify far to that point of order mr speaker my condolence to pauline and all of john family at what must be truly devastating time for they david use to work in my office and he send message just after john die he be very close to his father and see he as his hero and his friend we send our condolence to all of they obviously know john in the house for many year when he be first elect along with dennis skinner they share flat in clapham do not know what go on in that flat but while they be good friend they be very different character later learn that after the last vote take place in the house dennis and john would both leave to go back to the flat but they never travel together dennis always make sure that he get there first so that he could get hold of the one television in the flat turn it on and watch the dart the snooker or whatever else john would turn up and want to watch newsnight and dennis refuse to change the channel he would say no way you watch the dart with you can imagine the repartee and the argument that would have go on between they which would have be incredibly funny in the election john offer to help in any way he could and he be fantastic we do several event together one day we start in hull in the morning with the launch of our art manifesto and then go on tour all around yorkshire and humberside in the famous bus john seem to know the owner of every fish and chip shop in the whole of yorkshire and insist on stop at every one so we have big supply of fish and chip all day long then we get to scarborough where we be do rally in the pavilion by the seafront john and get up to speak on the stage and do not think lot of the people there realise that political rally be go on they think they be just there enjoy the sunshine and then these two guy get up on the stage and start talk the people love john because he bring out freddie the fox we have long discussion about the evil of foxhunt the evil of tory foxhunt the tories be always go to bring back foxhunting the tories would kill the fox then he pull freddie out of his coat and say look at poor freddie here they go to tear he apart that what the tories do to you he be love for all of that want to say thank you to john for what he do but also to remember that one of the crucial point in his political career be the issue of climate change and kyoto it be not easy popular or normal lot of people refuse to even consider what we be do to the natural world and the environment and how there be limit to what we can do hence the protocol that john negotiate and sign up to he be one of the people who be very important in start to change the global debate about climate change and respect for the natural world and the environment we should all say thank you to john prescott for that far to that point of order mr speaker the first time meet john prescott in his role as deputy prime minister be in when he open up admiralty arch to young homeless people as part of the winter shelter programme it be bitterly cold winter and at the time the conservative back bencher crispin blunt say that this project would be treat historic building as if it be flagship for undesirable give that john be frequently describe as an undesirable by many of his opponent throughout his life he take that as badge of honour and he be really proud of that homelessness project will never forget the way he share breakfast with those rough sleeper and take real interest in every one of their life it be testimony to his compassion his practical politic and his unwavering commitment to housing policy many million of council tenant see home improvement new window new door and home insulation and none of they will ever forget that those be the basic that many of we take for grant but which far too many people lack at the time in superb biography by my late former colleague on the independent colin brown naturally entitle fight talk there be lovely and tell quote from john there be those priest of the left who want to keep their conscience and there be those who will get their hand dirty belong to the dirty hand brigade john be regularly patronise and frequently under estimate but he have the last laugh by deliver for real work people for that we be all grateful far to that point of order mr speaker in the last six month of the united kingdom take over the rotate presidency of the european union and prime minister blair want to make big success of it one of his concern be that there be young british mep who be prone to behave very badly in the chamber and be particularly rude to visit head of state so john prescott be send to see he himself of course have serve as an mep and be big project supporter he love everything about the european union so he come to explain to that it would be very bad for britain if be to stand up and cause scene when prime minister blair be speak will not say that he threaten but certainly feel deeply intimidate and behave myself impeccably over the course of the next six month that be the bruiser john prescott perhaps couple of year later on remembrance sunday when the ceremony be over and the parade have finish be walk up whitehall and there to my astonishment walk on his own and without any security be the deputy prime minister say hello and wonder what he be do john have see group of arctic convoy veteran on the other side of whitehall seafarer himself he have go over to speak to the man who have endure such appalling hardship during the last couple of year of the war and say to they go to fight to

despite be former deputy prime minister he have to share an office with four other members of the house of lords he have recently be ennoble and he moan about the fact that there be no preferential

will stay with forever when come here and be serve in this place as he be serve in the lords he be source of terrific advice to and be proud to have count john as friend over the year send my good wish to pauline david and the rest of his family may john rest in peace far to that point of order mr speaker when be elect for beverley and holderness in john prescott the mp for neighbour kingston upon hull east be of course already legend he be the word mangle fast fiste former bar steward who have for the last eight year be deputy prime minister of this united kingdom hear the tribute from across the house and all the way in which that one man be able to influence history and make difference be hope an inspiration to aspirant working class politician all over the country but also to people in this house know john from few year before enter parliament he come to cambridge for transport summit so organise demonstration against it and stand outside all day the day go on and he do not come out when eventually he do come out be just about the only demonstrator leave immediately berate he and his entourage and we have surreal dance around the car park before he go up to jaguar and try to get in it be not his think it take he quite some time to forgive for that regularly see john as do colleague from hull such as the right hon member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson who be sit on the government front bench on hull train and he be normally surround by paper at four place table that he be try to keep entirely to himself although he be

people to this day hold he in the high regard as have be remark he lead our delegation to the cop at kyoto in and be widely regard as the key element in deliver its historic outcome the first time an international agreement be make to recognise and cut climate emission the former us vice president al gore say that he have never work with anyone in politic quite like john prescott john continue to

commit to phase out fossil fuel know my team and be follow in the footstep of someone who may have come from humble background but go on to change the world far to that point of order mr speaker over two month ago rise to give my maiden speech in this chamber open with comical line about one of my constituency most famous son lord john prescott although be sad to be commemorate his passing today it be important to reflect on the indelible mark that he have leave on british politic formidable character john prescott be political giant but never stop be one of we an ordinary down to earth working class man the ambition of john and other for community like his as part of trailblaze labour government be the reason why so many of we be here today often underestimate by both his political ally and enemy he be the glue that hold the labour government together and see it deliver so much personally know he little more than as an overly keen teenager at labour party conference ask for selfie with political hero he do oblige although in his customary unimpressed fashion but his impact on and so many on the labour benches have be huge on behalf of the people of clwyd east say fond farewell to one of our own treasured son of north wales political trailblazer and true one off my thought be with pauline and his family far to that point of order mr speaker want to add to all the warm tribute to john get to know he and encounter he outside of political context it be matter of record that towards the end of his time as deputy prime minister he have several bout of ill health and be admit to hospital on couple of occasion and he be admit to the critical care unit where be nurse at the time he make an incredible impression on and my fellow staff he be really great patient which let face it can not be say of every vip that cross into ward he be warm and fun and abrasive in the right way and challenge in the right way one of my most abide memory be be summon in to see the deputy prime minister because his hospital food be rubbish he want to complain about that hope that be the only time deputy prime minister call in to criticise for something that be responsible for but you never know it be testament to he that after that spell in hospital he invite all the staff who have look after he to do big tour in very john prescott way at admiralty house where he take we all through the back corridor of whitehall entertain we with great bit of history and anecdote and finish up with mock auction he have acquire lot of geegaw and knick knack from all his diplomatic visit abroad and he be throw they out with his very strong arm for people in the room to catch hope that many of those people include colleague of mine at the time still have some of those item and will treasure they give my heartfelt condolence to pauline and to john family the house be always at its good at these time and be sure that john would have be smile at the tribute they be fantastic the only thing would add be that john manage to divide hull into two when he become robin but we will leave it at that israel gaza conflict arrest warrants urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make statement on the government response to the decision take by the international criminal court pre trial chamber to issue arrest warrant in respect of the israel gaza conflict last thursday judge at the international criminal court issue arrest warrant for the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu former defence minister yoav gallant and the reportedly deceased mohammed diab ibrahim al masri commonly know as deif commander in chief of the military wing of hamas the icc be the primary international institution for investigate and prosecute the most serious crime of international concern it be actively investigate allegation of the grave crime in country around the world include ukraine sudan and libya in line with this government state commitment to the rule of law we respect the independence of the icc we will comply with our international obligation there be domestic legal process through our independent court that determine whether to endorse an arrest warrant by the icc in accordance with the international criminal court act that process have never be test because the uk have never be visit by an icc indictee if there be such visit to the uk there would be court process and due process would be follow in relation to those issue there be no moral equivalence between israel democracy and hamas and lebanese hezbollah two terrorist organisation this government have be clear that israel have right to defend itself in accordance with international law that right be not under question and the court approval of the warrant last week do not change that israel be of course partner across uk priority include trade investment security and science and technology we co operate across wide range of issue for our mutual benefit this government remain focused on push for an immediate ceasefire to bring an end to the devastating violence in gaza that be essential to protect civilian ensure the release of hostage and increase humanitarian aid into gaza we have always say that diplomacy be what will see an end to this conflict and that can only be achieve through dialogue it be in the long term interest of the israelis palestinians and the wide region to agree to ceasefire deal urgently and bring this devastating conflict to an end the international criminal court decision to issue arrest warrant for the state of israel prime minister benjamin netanyahu and its former defence minister yoav gallant will do nothing to help secure the release of those poor hostage who have be hold captive by hamas for more than year it will not help to get more aid into gaza and it will not deliver sustainable end to this awful conflict in charge israeli leader alongside hamas the icc appear to be draw moral equivalence between israel war of self defence and hamas terrorism we utterly reject any moral equivalence the only beneficiary of this decision be hamas and their terrorist sponsor iran who be now celebrate this propaganda coup as great victory for hamas and hezbollah since the icc decision we have have dither from ministers confused messaging and no clarity so be grateful to the minister for his remark today the government have indicate already that they will seek to enforce these warrant through our own court and there be process around that on the issue of warrant we have express serious concern over process jurisdiction and the position on the complementarity principle we believe that the warrant for mr netanyahu and mr gallant have no basis in international law do the government believe that the court have jurisdiction in this case give that israel be not party to the rome statute and palestine be not recognise state do the minister agree that the icc must act within legal norm in the absence of the icc make public the specific context of the charge do the minister share the concern express about report of process error in the icc investigation and the concern express by lord macdonald the former director of public prosecutions about the use by the prosecutor of an expert panel finally but crucially what effect do the minister believe that mr netanyahu immunity under international law as serve prime minister of country that be not state party have on enforce these warrant in the uk own court these be important question on which look forward to the minister response he have already speak about secure the release of hostage and more aid come into gaza but at this time when such conflict be take place it be important that we have clarity from the government welcome the question from the right hon member across the benches utmost in the government mind be the need to bring an immediate end to the conflict in gaza and to secure the release of the hostage whose family have meet she know that be familiar with these issue from my previous life we also need to see more aid go into gaza the question at issue with the icc be separate from that diplomacy will continue regardless of the icc process but have understand it to be the common position of the house that the international rule of law be an important commitment the international criminal court be an important body the primary body in enforce those norm and the issue on jurisdiction and complementarity be hear by the pre trial chamber its three judge issue their finding think we should respect those call the chair of the foreign affairs committee the international criminal court be create when country put their name to the rome statute and sign up to the principle that certain basic standard of behaviour must be enforce internationally with those law applicable to everyone no matter who they be from the time when winston churchill lead the conservative party this country have be proud supporter of international law it be wrong for we to try to undermine it do my hon friend share my deep disappointment that the conservatives have fall as far as they have as think have be clear from our action from july when we become the government the international rule of law be incredibly important to this government all our action will be guide by it call the liberal democrat spokesperson the conflict between israel and hamas have have devastating impact on palestinian and israeli civilian with woman and child pay particularly terrible price now that the international criminal court have issue arrest warrant for those it believe be culpable the uk have obligation under international law which we must uphold the previous conservative government choose to be selective with those obligation when it come to the icc jurisdiction in the occupied palestinian territories that be deeply regrettable and damaging for our country and greatly regret that conservative front bench members be pursue that same line today it be right that the government have commit to uphold the ruling and welcome the minister statement that they will support the process to enforce the arrest warrant do the minister share my concern about the word of republican senator lindsey graham who have propose sanction nation include the uk who uphold the ruling will he outline the specific new step that the government be take to secure an immediate bilateral ceasefire with all party so that we can put stop to the humanitarian disaster in gaza get the hostage home and open the door to two state solution every member of the government most particularly the foreign secretary and the rest of the foreign office ministerial team be engage every day include this morning in press all party for an immediate ceasefire in gaza for an immediate ceasefire in lebanon and for de escalation of violence in gaza and the occupied palestinian territories but also more broadly in the middle east where violence remain far too high the icc have issue an arrest warrant for the prime minister of democratic state that be uk ally have find that there be reasonable ground that he be responsible for war crime and crime against humanity do that not call for action as well as word from the uk government which might include end trade with illegal settlement the sanctioning of member of that government and settler and indeed recognition of the state of palestine if we be to show not only our disapproval but how we want to move forward recognise my hon friend long commitment to these issue as you would expect madam deputy speaker will not comment far on the icc process which need now to carry through in accordance with due process in the way you would expect on sanction which have be discuss before in the chamber be not in the usual way at liberty to provide any further commentary on who we might consider for they whatever reservation one may have about the conduct of the conflict in gaza there be two fundamental principle first netanyahu be democratically elect leader of sovereign state and secondly that state be conduct legitimate war of self defence the minister acknowledge those fact but do he not appreciate how this ruling be see by many of my constituent as an affront to those principle be slightly stump by the question from the opposition we be signatory to the icc act think the whole house agree with the importance of the rule of law representation be make to the icc in the pre trial chamber and it have come to its decision think we should respect its independence find it shocking but not surprising that the conservative party have choose to downgrade and disparage the highly respected international criminal court we be nation that uphold the rule of law so be proud that the new labour government have choose to respect the independence of the icc in its arrest warrant against benjamin netanyahu yoav gallant and mohammed deif on the basis that there be reasonable ground for their criminal responsibility for potential war crime do the minister agree that it be important that we respect the independence of that icc judgment and that if require we implement those finding be not really able to go much far than to say that there be domestic legal process through our independent court that would determine whether to endorse an arrest warrant we would follow due process in the way that hon member would expect this be decision not for ministers but for an independent court the minister may be aware that have fight the corner for international court time and again in this house view uphold the authority of those court and their reputation as very important the difficulty here be not just that israel be democracy but that it have an internal independent judiciary which put limit on what any government can do in israel that be why equate or appear to equate netanyahu with all the other monster that the international criminal court have quite properly prosecute risk bring the court into disrepute know that the right hon member have look at these issue over long period of time question of complementarity be important and understand that they be consider by the pre trial chamber several of our ally and international partner have outline their commitment to fully support the icc include canada the netherlands sweden belgium and ireland so welcome the government commitment to respect the independence of the icc do the minister agree that it have high evidential threshold for issue arrest warrant for alleged perpetrator which have be demonstrate in this case the deliberation of the icc on this matter have go on for some time think it be clear for all to see the way in which it have proceed and welcome it last week attend memorial service for the people of gaza with family of palestinian origin here in the uk believe the minister have meet some of those representative we hear from woman call kitam who describe how overnight she lose member of her family as she walk back and sit behind she break down in sobs as she remember so painfully that day she deserve justice the issuing of warrant be not justice there be still process to go through and trial to be have be it not right that whatever the court those outcome be adhere to may press he on the ruling of the icj advisory opinion on the occupation that ruling be at the core of this it should mean that we do much more than just meet those family and share in their pain as the hon member allude to have meet those family and many other family who have be so wound by the conduct of this conflict over the course of the last year family on both side both the hostage family and the many many palestinians and lebanese who have see their life so cruelly turn upside down as say early in the end it be only diplomacy that will bring an end to the conflict we will continue to have contact with all side include those indict we will continue to press all those with whom we engage to bring an early end to this war on the icj we have set out our position before we be consider the judgment carefully we have provide an explanation of our position so far in the united nations it be an important far reach judgment and we hope to be able to say more in due course welcome the minister confirmation that the uk will be uphold the icc arrest warrant for the hamas general and israeli leader the icc find ground to believe that netanyahu and gallant each bear criminal responsibility for the war crime of starvation as method of warfare and the crime against humanity of murder persecution and other inhumane act it go on to refer to the war crime of intentionally direct an attack against the civilian population on that last point what moral justification be there now for continue arm sale use by israeli force at the behest of prime minister accuse of such serious war crime when will we use every diplomatic lever to stop the killing free all hostage and stop sell arm to country lead by someone accuse of such horrific war crime would like to just be clear that what have say this afternoon be not that the government will uphold arrest warrant what have be clear about this afternoon be that due process will be follow these be question for independent court in the uk and it be independent court that would review the arrest warrant if that situation be to arise my hon friend ask about aid want to be absolutely clear insufficient aid be get into gaza travel myself to the gaza border and see the restriction israel be put on aid reach gaza those restriction have be call out by and other foreign office ministers day in day out we be take step with our partner and our ally to try to ensure that people in gaza have the aid they need as winter come in in order to survive these be grave matter and understand the frustration right across the house that we have not see the amount of aid in gaza that we would like to see recognise that people be ask for yet more to be do on the specific question about the arm licence suspension announce to the house on september we will of course keep that under review we will consider the finding of the icc in relation to that assessment last year the labour party have to be drag into accept that there be collective punishment of the palestinian people indeed the hon gentleman boss say that war be ugly the labour party early this year have to be drag into even utter the word ceasefire will the minister show the leadership that his boss fail to show and say that if benjamin netanyahu foot touch the ground in the uk he will comply with the arrest warrant the right hon member say with dismay that war be ugly war be ugly and we be do everything that we can to bring it to close through all the diplomatic measure we would expect this be not an issue for grandstand this be an issue for diplomacy that be what the government be commit to surely central to the debate today must be the uk ongoing political role as israel close ally and the fact that uk make weapon include component be still be use by israel do the minister recognise that beyond the commitment to uphold the icc arrest warrant the uk failure to clearly condemn the collective punishment of civilian an intent explicitly indicate by key israeli lead figure and the continued military support for israel ongoing onslaught in gaza have serious implication for the uk own human right obligation and the fate of million of innocent man woman and child will not rehearse too much the answer provide on september and on numerous occasion in the chamber since then we have suspend with one exemption to which be happy to return all the arm that we be sell to israel that could be use in gaza that suspension in our assessment also cover the west bank and lebanon we be take action in accordance with our commitment under international humanitarian law and we will continue to do so can we be absolutely clear about what the government be say it seem that the government be not say that there would be an automatic arrest should benjamin netanyahu arrive in this country but they be say that there would due process can the minister confirm that customary international law do not permit the arrest or delivery of the serve prime minister of non state party to the icc so the minister be commit himself to due process but not to arrest be correct in my understanding there be domestic legal process through our independent court and we can not prejudge that process note that the shadow attorney general have write to the attorney general about question of detail in relation to some of the point to which the hon gentleman have allude and the attorney general tell that he will be write back on the subject of those more detailed point while we watch and work tirelessly to secure ceasefire in gaza which be really important simply because if child do not see an end in sight neither do the family in gaza do the minister agree that britain reputation on the world scene as global leader in uphold justice would be undermine if britain do not respect the independence of the icc which be what conservative member be imply this government think that adherence to international law and be see to adhere to international law be incredibly important and in everything we have do since july we have seek to underline that principle which hope be one on which the whole house would support we the minister have assure we that the arrest warrant will be carry out and hope that be the case but will he also consider this question if an arrest warrant have be issue for the leader of country and the international court of justice have find that country deeply want in respect of its behaviour as an occupy power and the war crime that have be commit why be we still supply weapon that be be use in the bombardment of gaza and destroy life as we speak as say in answer to question from my own benches we take step on september to ensure that with one exemption which be happy to go into we be not sell arm that be be use and could pose breach of international humanitarian law in gaza that continue to be the position and it be keep under regular review the icc decision be crucial step towards ensure justice and accountability for the crime against humanity commit in gaza and israel it be vital for the government to act without fear or favour in order to uphold the international rule base system war crime be wrong whoever commit they and wherever they happen whether they be commit by russian force in unlawfully occupy ukraine or by israeli force on unlawfully occupy palestinian territory will the minister now review all diplomatic economic and political relation with israel to ensure that our country be not complicit in the atrocity that be take place in gaza the west bank and lebanon can confirm that the department and the government as whole keep our international obligation under close review include in relation to the theatre describe last week be in the west bank and see for myself the incursion by settler into the occupy palestinian territories follow recent comment from israel far right finance minister bezalel smotrich who describe in explicit term the active effort to annex the west bank into israel do the minister agree that now be the time to sanction smotrich the comment of finance minister smotrich have be condemn in this chamber before and we can reiterate that condemnation as the hon lady would expect however we can not comment on sanction that may or may not be under consideration in the usual way be no friend of hamas but we must remember that prime minister netanyahu promise we intelligence lead precision attack in gaza we have see daily violation of international law people kill restriction on food and aid and journalist kill welcome the government announcement about respect the icc decision but may urge they to consider use all lever include sanction against two israeli government ministers the settler in the west bank and other organisation operate therein will not comment on what sanction may be under review for reason that be well establish but draw my hon friend attention to the sanction that we take in october against israeli settler and organisation involve in both breach of international law and violence in the west bank our close ally be the united states of america and there have be widespread condemnation of the issuing of these arrest warrant across congress what effect do the minister think this decision will have on our relationship with the united states of america and particularly with the incoming administration who have very different view the uk be state party to the rome statute and that bring with it obligation that put we in different position from that of the us we will continue to engage with both the current and incoming us administrations in the share interest of our two country and across the full range of our priority the atrocity that lead to the issuing of arrest warrant continue to this day not least in healthcare facility with devastating story come out of gaza my hon friend have set out his frustration at aid not reach such facility yet more sanction could be apply by this government why will he not escalate the uk response to the israeli government by introduce sanction so that they feel the real pain of our country but also understand that we want to ensure that justice be serve by the icc want to reassure the house about how focus the government be on the question of aid access into gaza as say have travel to the region and raise these issue repeatedly with all party include the israeli government we need to see flood of aid into gaza that have be the commitment of the israeli government and regret that we have not yet see flood of aid and that palestinians be suffer as consequence winter be come and palestinians in gaza be extremely vulnerable we will continue to press the israeli government to do everything that they can to ensure that more aid reach gaza and indeed all part of the occupied palestinian territories that require it make these point forcefully this morning and will continue to do so the icc have issue arrest warrant for crime include direct attack on civilian open source information show that on average royal air force reconnaissance flight be go over gaza nearly four time day although we all seek the information necessary to gain the release of the hostage how confident be the minister that the information gather from those flight and share with israel have not be use to facilitate any attack on civilian will not go into operational detail but can assure the house that the surveillance aircraft be unarmed and do not have combat role they be task solely with locate hostage include british national and they will continue to do so in response to the right hon member for witham priti patel note that the uk under the previous conservative government sign an icc state party statement in support of the icc and to preserve it from political interference just before the election the foreign secretary have confirm the uk acceptance of and respect for the icc arrest warrant for netanyahu war crime therefore be it not now incumbent on the government to take effective concrete step to prevent further such act by ban all arm licence to israel include those relate to part by impose sanction on individual on asset and on good trading with the illegally occupy west bank and by the urgent recognition of palestinian statehood will not rehearse the point that we have already discuss on sanction the foreign secretary have set out our position in relation to the suspension of arm licence and the exemption and that remain the position we will keep our assessment under regular review include the finding of the icc frankly be disappointed that the government be not give any clear response therefore ask this question in october over expert in international law and in conflict and genocide study give warning of clear prospect of genocide in november over united nations expert call it genocide in the making we then have the icj judgment that call it plausible genocide and judge from the icj say the alarm have now be sound by the court all the indicator of genocidal activity be flash red in gaza now we have an arrest warrant do this government stand by their conviction that genocide be not be commit in gaza yes or no it be important that we treat the international institution with the respect that they deserve this be an indictment from the icc and we respect it the icj process to which the hon gentleman refer have not find it be at an advisory opinion stage we need to treat international law with the respect that it deserve the minister will be aware that as well as the icc recent decision to issue arrest warrant there be now an entire body of international law include the icj advisory opinion adopt by the un general assembly rule israel occupation of the palestinian territory illegal as well as south africa case at the icj on genocide that point towards clear position in international law do the minister therefore agree that if we be to preserve the integrity of the international rule base order we must start by end the international hypocrisy and double standard and reaffirm that all state include the uk have an absolute obligation under international law to act now to bring all those who commit war crime to justice thank my hon friend for his question want to underline this government commitment in relation to accountability for war crime we stand against international crime of this nature in all place everywhere and our commitment to international law be one of the most powerful lever we have in try to prevent war crime ask for the minister forgiveness because do not hear whether he answer this question from my right hon friend the shadow foreign secretary be it his understanding that customary international law do not permit the arrest or delivery of serve prime minister of non state party to the icc and that the uk seek to arrest such prime minister would not only breach our international obligation but be unlawful under the international criminal court act for the awareness of the house the shadow attorney general have write about the two different legal interpretation of immunity and have seek the attorney general view on these matter think the shadow attorney general acknowledge that this be case on which the court be the competent authority but the attorney general have undertake to respond to that letter in due course the law be the law and the evidence be the evidence whether or not it be politically convenient or diplomatically helpful the law be the law the international criminal court have be clear and my hon friend be absolutely right to reject the opposition call to turn this into political decision it should remain an independent legal decision for our court and for the international criminal court and the minister should continue exactly as he be agree welcome the icc decision and sincerely hope that we will live up to our international obligation if the prime minister of israel visit the uk you have say yourself that you regret the fact that more aid be not get into gaza and that you have be call out the israeli government for not let in more aid be it not time to do more than just call out the israeli government and tell they how angry you be be it not time to end all arm export to israel impose sanction end trade with all the illegal settlement and recognise palestine as state we will continue to press these point with vigour and we will continue to keep all other measure under review as have say rise order before call the next speaker remind member not to use the word you think the conservative party style itself the party of law and order but it seem that that be increasingly not the case when it come to international law the government be right to uphold the icc decision and they be right to vote for last week un security council resolution on ceasefire the minister will be aware that there be increase evidence include from organisation such as human rights watch of the forcible displacement of palestinians from the north of gaza he will be aware that this be crime against humanity and that two of the main proponent be israeli ministers smotrich and ben gvir the prime minister have confirm that the government be look at this so when will the government move to sanction those ministers as part of wide package of further action to uphold international law we follow report from northern gaza closely and with concern and we have repeatedly raise many of these issue will not comment far on sanction but wish to be clear that the forced displacement of palestinians from gaza be not consistent with israel obligation do the minister agree that one of our great tool against tyranny anywhere be that friend or foe rich or poor elect or unelecte the law apply to everybody and that the universality of certain crime mean that they can be prosecute anywhere as hope have make clear this afternoon this government be commit to the international rule of law and will continue to be so despite what the minister have say the government concede at the royal court of justice last week that uk make part could be use in violation of international law in gaza and admit that israel have show no commitment to uphold these legal obligation despite this the government have continue to authorise offensive arm export expose themselves to criminal liability it be disappointing that the foreign secretary be not here today but will the minister let our constituent know whether the government will end their complicity in genocide impose sanction and end all arm sale will he confirm that should netanyahu who face an icc arrest warrant for war crime and crime against humanity enter uk territory he will be immediately arrest yes or no will return briefly to the foreign secretary statement on september in which he say that suspend all licence for the programme would undermine the global supply chain that be vital for the security of the uk our ally and report september vol he go on to set out how the suspension of arm licence would apply to the direct sale of component to israel but would not apply to the global supply chain that continue to be the position forty three thousand dead possibly under the rubble school and hospital destroy child kill include by drone and by be shoot in the head many hon member say that this be genocide many month ago now that the icc prosecutor have call benjamin netanyahu potential serious war criminal commit crime against humanity do the minister agree that now be the time to recognise the state of palestine and end all military and financial co operation with the israeli government while their leader be essentially international fugitive will not rehearse our position on the recognition of the state of palestine other than to say that we believe that the palestinians have an inalienable right to state alongside safe and secure israel the government hope to take step to advance that as part of contribution to two state solution the hon member suggest think no contact at all with the israeli government as consequence of the icc ruling it be only diplomacy that will bring an end to this conflict we will continue to have direct contact and in that direct contact we will continue to do all we can to secure an immediate ceasefire the release of all hostage aid into gaza and more safe secure and stable middle east say this to my hon friend as constructively as possibly can number of we have sit here for month and have ask question about sanction but the response from ministers have be to say we can not comment on sanction in the house not only do that render sanction ineffective but it break down the accountability of ministers to this house we deserve well statement than that on the legal process my hon friend have rightly say that we will respect international law and comply with the international criminal court jurisdiction and decision if have get the wording right he say that it will be for the domestic legal process involve where do physical arrest come within that domestic legal process let deal with why we do not provide advance comment on sanction and then will turn to the domestic legal process hear my right hon friend the reason that we do not provide commentary on sanction be that to do so in advance would reduce their effect the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty who be sit next to may correct but think that we have probably issue upwards of or maybe even sanction in the short time we have be in government there have be no shortage of sanction for this house to comment on recognise that the two on which have most be press this afternoon be of intense political interest however despite that intense political interest if we be to prejudge sanction and trail they in this house before we make they we would reduce their impact the same be true of the hundred of sanction that we have place on russia over the year and it would be the same in every forum in relation to the domestic legal process hope that my right hon friend will forgive for not enter too deeply into hypothetical about how court might discharge its finding on these matter israel be democracy in the past its court have show themselves unafraid to put even senior politician on trial what assessment have the minister make of the israelis own ability to bring human right case in their own court this be describe in international law as the question of complementarity and it be consider by the pre trial chamber give the independence of the icc do not think it appropriate for to offer further commentary argument be make by various state on this matter and the pre trial chamber come to its finding do the minister agree that as well as demand an immediate ceasefire the freeing of all hostage and unhindered aid get into gaza we must ensure that the perpetrator of heinous war crime and crime against humanity whether they be friend or foe be hold to account under international law base on justice that be blind objective and impartial play politic with court undermine justice thank my hon friend for his question support for international criminal justice and accountability have traditionally be matter on which we have have widespread support in this house it will continue to be priority for the british government the icc the world high criminal court have reasonable ground to allege that the israeli leader be guilty of war crime and crime against humanity the other world court the international court of justice have find that there be plausible risk that israel be commit genocide against palestinians and that israel occupation and annexation be unlawful ask the minister two question first do he agree that the uk have obligation under international law to prevent genocide to bring israel unlawful occupation to an end and to bring suspect perpetrator of grave breach of international law to justice secondly and quite simply what will the uk do differently as result of the decision of the icc and the icj the minister say that he will pull out all the stop we have hear many suggestion here today include stop the export of what will the government do differently do the government accept that we have international obligation indeed we do have set out this afternoon how we would discharge they in relation to the icc have also set out the view that we take on the icj process we will continue to do everything we can to ensure that there be proper international justice that all abide by we be one of the icc major funder we commit million year to ensure that the icc can function properly in everything that this government do we be try to ensure the international rule of law and we will continue to do so the uk have responsibility not just to respect the independence of international court but to take active step to promote compliance with international obligation when nation or leader have be accuse of commit war crime the uk have hold itself up as global leader in place sanction it be unconscionable that in this situation we be yet to stop all sale of arm to israel if israel be accuse of commit war crime do the continue sale of any arm to israel not make the uk potentially complicit give the gravity of the situation will the minister far clarify why he can not comment on sanction or indeed on the other step that the government be plan or willing to take to make clear the uk condemnation of the continue slaughter of civilian in gaza let comment on arm sale as they have be raise again will not rehearse the argument about the exemption in relation to the arm that be license to be sell to israel the category that have be suspend be the category that pose risk of be involve in breach of international humanitarian law in gaza those weapon we also believe would be the weapon at issue in the west bank and in lebanon there be second category of weapon that be for resale elsewhere which be not relevant to event in israel there be third category of weapon that be use either for defensive purpose or for purpose with which nobody in this house would disagree body armour and helmet for aid worker go into gaza for example say gently to colleague across the house that there be not in the rest of the arm sale some solution to the dilemma that face we the suspension of arm sale have be do carefully and have be aim at the potential breach of international humanitarian law it have be reach carefully and judiciously include in relation to the that remain the position have degree of sympathy with the minister who have be ask to substitute in lieu of the foreign secretary today so will ask he question of fact do he recognise that pursuant to section of the international criminal court act representative of non state party to the rome statute will remain immune from prosecution unless that non state party expressly waive that right to the icc do not need sympathy just careful listening the same question be ask by the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes and the answer be the same the shadow attorney general have raise the matter with the attorney general and letter will be send in due course must press the minister on the question of arm sale he mention direct and indirect arm sale and he say that the indirect arm sale be either irrelevant or impossible to remedy as understand it there be no reason why part that be make in the uk sell to the united states and use by israel can not be subject to conditional licence under which they be sell to the united states with the proviso that they can not be use in gaza give that how can it be legally or morally justifiable to continue allow uk part for fighter jet that be be use to kill palestinian child to be export even indirectly to an israeli leader who face an arrest warrant for war crime and crime against humanity we hear about the review but while that review have be ongoing under the last government and this one thousand and thousand of palestinian civilian have be kill for clarity we have suspend arm licence where part for the programme be sell directly to israel where they be sell to the global spare pool it be not possible to disentangle where they go in that pool and see their final destination that be why we have make the exemption and it be why we judge that do so be vital for the security of the uk for our ally and for nato do the minister agree that the cold blooded slaughter of ten of thousand of innocent people in gaza can not be justify as self defence do he also agree that contrary to the trumpian line adopt by those on the conservative benches just because country be democracy that do not provide it with blanket immunity from international law the hon member refer to the terrible loss of life in gaza which be in the mind and heart of the whole house we be democracy as much as signatory to petition may wish otherwise we abide by international law and we expect our ally to do the same and we make that point with force let we remind this house why we be here benjamin netanyahu and yoav gallant stand accuse of very serious crime the crime against humanity of murder and the crime against humanity of persecution and starvation as weapon of war seventy per cent of those kill in this war be innocent woman and child nobody in this house can think of war in live memory in which of those kill be woman and child want to ask the minister very specific question because he have evade all of this so far can he tell we one concrete step that he will take apart from execute the arrest warrant as the uk be oblige to do as state party to the rome statute that we can all tangibly grasp we would like to hear it please have be clear about what the government have do and will continue to do if the hon member would like recap on the very first morning that become minister we announce the restoration of funding to unrwa we have provide significant aid to the people of gaza we have provide aid that have not get into gaza and we have raise that with the israelis my ministerial colleague and have travel to the region to press these issue both alone and in company with the french foreign minister this house be unite in its concern about what will happen in gaza in december there be no disagreement that insufficient aid have go in there be urgent almost frantic effort every day in the foreign commonwealth and development office to try to ensure that adequate aid reach the palestinians understand the frustration of this house we be work as hard as we can and we will continue to do so we take concrete action each and every day on this issue the icc find that there be no justification under international humanitarian law for the restriction of aid by the israeli government indeed the icc detail how doctor have be force to carry out treatment and amputation without anaesthetic include on child the government response must include redouble our effort to get more aid into gaza can my hon friend confirm what pressure be be put on the israeli government in addition to what we have already do to get more aid into gaza in addition to the step have just outline we will be work closely with our partner and hope to be able to update the house shortly on some of the measure we be take in company to try to ensure that sufficient aid get into gaza particularly over this vital winter period the icc arrest warrant be welcome but in themselves they will not bring an end to israeli war crime and ethnic cleansing and the killing of innocent man woman and child it be an international legal obligation on the uk government to prevent ethnic cleansing and genocide will the minister explain what specific measure the government have take and be take to stop israel ethnic cleansing in northern gaza and what concrete step the uk government have take to comply with the genocide convention the hon member ask about northern gaza and some of the specific measure that have be take as say in answer to previous question we have be pay close attention to event in northern gaza by way of example we watch closely with horror the event at kamal adwan hospital raise they myself repeatedly with the israeli authority and urge they to preserve life at that hospital include among the child we take every opportunity to underline to the israelis their responsibility as an occupy power in the whole of gaza but particularly in northern gaza and indeed the obligation that fall to they in relation to medical facility particularly where there be ongoing treatment of child as there be in that case recognise the hon member frustration at the situation in northern gaza we be clear that northern gaza must not be cut off from the south there must be no forcible transfer of gazans from or within gaza nor any reduction in the territory of the gaza strip the government of israel must minimise evacuation notice to only area where they be militarily necessary provide timely and consistent information on when and where they take effect and be clear on where it be safe for civilian to move to the polio vaccination roll out have now end but an estimate to child in northern gaza be not reach due to intense israel defence forces activity that be deplorable delay vaccination of any child in gaza put they at risk and be unacceptable and we make those point to the israelis recognise the hon member frustration but we be do what we can to try to ensure that child and other in northern gaza have access to the aid they need many of my constituent have write to to express their horror at what be happen in gaza do the minister agree that the united nations relief and works agency play an indispensable role in the provision of humanitarian assistance and do he oppose the bills recently pass in the knesset that would prevent unrwa operation thank my hon friend for pass on the concern of his constituent know that that be feel right across the country and that many other member would wish to put on record the concern of their constituent too do condemn the knesset bill in relation to unrwa we have make the point clear that unrwa be indispensable only unrwa can provide the aid into the occupy palestinian territories at the scale require and we will continue to press for unrwa continued operation in accordance with the relevant security council resolution it be crucial that the labour government comply with our obligation under international law to uphold the icc rule and enforce the arrest warrant against israeli ministers that compliance be vital give the previous conservative government besmirching of the international criminal court and in turn damage of the uk stand on the world stage many of my constituent in wokingham would like to see the uk stand up for what be right and see that the uk do not turn its back on international law will the minister confirm that the government will not undermine the icc rule by unequivocally agree to uphold the arrest warrant reassure the hon member and ask he to pass on to his constituent that this government will indeed do the right thing and stand up for international law have set out the manner in which we would do that over the course of this afternoon welcome the government commitment to uphold their obligation under international law and therefore to issue arrest warrant to these man if they set foot on british soil if the government acknowledge that the prime minister of israel should be on trial for war crime and crime against humanity how morally and legally can we continue to supply he with the weapon be use by israel in its horrific assault on innocent civilian in gaza have outline our position in relation to both our international and domestic obligation to the icc and our position on arm sale reassure my hon friend that we will consider the finding of the icc in the ongoing review process in relation to arm sale be truly perplexed as most of the british population watch this debate no doubt will be by some of the argument be advanced when it come to the icc topic such as morality and equivalence do not feature this be principle of law an independent body encapsulate some of the most senior member of the judiciary have make finding yet we have the issue of democracy and morality be use to argue for some sort of impunity for leader will the minister state that if benjamin netanyahu arrive on these shore if the icc have issue warrant we would at least detain he subject to our domestic procedure the hon member make an impassioned and welcome commitment to due process and the independence of the law and will not demur from that by provide commentary on what domestic court might do in hypothetical situation be frankly astonish at the principle underlie some of the comment make by the shadow foreign secretary and some of her conservative colleague today have be give assembly to primary school child across the earley and woodley constituency emphasise that british democracy mean that nobody be above the rule of law hope that one day conservative members might understand what the child of the earley and woodley constituency instinctively understand which be that we should be equal under the law whether we be the political leader of democracy or otherwise that be why welcome the minister statement that the government will comply with their international obligation the minister have set out the work he have be do in travel to the region and witness at first hand the blockage of aid into gaza by the israeli government the united nations state that over of food aid have be block which of course lead to the risk and ongoing fact of starvation in the region what can the minister and the government do in line with our positive obligation under international law to prevent future atrocity occur in gaza the government be deeply concerned by the late integrated food security phase classification find about food insecurity in gaza we be make effort to try to ensure more rapid and regular flow of aid include item that have be bar which often seem to be those that be most vital for winterisation as the international humanitarian community call it in gaza we will continue to press for more flexibility on these point so that the necessary tent sleep bag and other equipment require to safeguard palestinian life over the course of the winter can move in at the scale that be require have see and live through the misuse of lawfare in northern ireland whereby the terrorist use law to target those who seek to live by the law while ignore the fact that every one of their action be illegal very firmly oppose the uk stamp of approval on any icc decision on israel it be only when you not you mean the minister but you mean have be the victim of whitewash propaganda as unionist have in northern ireland that you truly understand the danger will the minister not recall that israel have be defend itself under perpetual attack and that this icc ruling be simply affirm the hamas agenda of hide terrorism behind woman and child sacrifice they to achieve their goal that goal be clear to wipe israel off the map that be something that we can never support and hope the minister will never support it either do not support the action of hamas condemn they outright and utterly the action of hamas include the continued keeping of hostage represent unspeakable cruelty both to the israeli people and to british national we do not forget emily damari who be still hold more than year since she be take that be say we can both condemn terrorist organisation such as hamas and lebanese hezbollah and encourage our ally to keep to the very high standard and our commitment to international law be part of that contribution have just return from the west bank where meet roland friedrich director of unrwa affair and see unrwa work at first hand in the west bank alone that work include run school and health centre and provide public service such as clean drinking water and rubbish collection do the minister agree that there be no viable alternative to unrwa and will he do everything in his power to ensure israel allow its vital operation to continue do agree there be no alternative to unrwa and we will raise those point both directly with israel and in company it be vital that unrwa underpin by succession of un security council resolution be able to continue its vital work both in the west bank and gaza and across the wide region can the minister reassure we that he and other ministers have directly press israel on compliance with international humanitarian law in their meeting with their counterpart can do this morning and will continue to do so emily be british citizen who as the minister have say have be hold hostage ever since the attack would the minister explain what measure the government be take to make contact with those hold the hostage so that we can bring emily home hostage case be some of the most horrifying situation that family can face know that many people in this house have meet with emily family and have see at first hand their bravery but also the agony that they feel year on regret deeply that the good chance of release for all of the hostage be through negotiate agreement and call on all party to come back to the table to try to advance the agreement necessary to secure release of hostage an immediate ceasefire and reduction in the awful violence that scar we all storm bert with permission madam deputy speaker would like to update the house on storm bert the

environmental audit committee for his question and of course sympathise with resident in his constituency who have be affect by the recent flooding and indeed previous flooding the government be review the flood funding formula to see how we can make it more effective that include nature base flood management such as plant more tree far upstream to help the land hold more water so that less

that that vital line and other be upgrade and make more robust storm event also have an impact on our sewerage network research by the save windermere campaign estimate that storm overflow discharge untreated sewage into our lake begin at this morning and by midday could have reach volume of million litre will the government speed up action to prevent egregious storm overflow like that across our

farmer away from such scheme altogether will he revisit that decision be grateful to the hon gentleman for his comment and question share and echo his gratitude to member across the house for the work they have carry out to support their local constituent and signpost they to appropriate support we will be ensure that the environment agency continue to engage with member on that important work the

support to the welsh government if that be require this weekend much of my constituency be under severe flood warning business road and home be flood we be lucky than in previous year in term of severity but in place it be agonisingly close with river centimetre away from break their bank calder valley have have two major flood in the past decade and the fact that we avoid the same level of destruction this time be in no small part because of the work of local flood warden natural flood management organisation such as slow the flow and calderdale council pay tribute to they it be almost decade since the serious flood in calder valley on boxing day we have further flood in while the environment agency have carry out flood prevention work in mytholmroyd and brighouse it have not even

really anxious thank my hon friend very much for his question be sure that his constituent will be pleased to hear of the increase in funding over the next two year to support area that be affect by flood as well as the review to the flood funding formula that we be consult on to ensure that we be take the most appropriate and effective step necessary to protect community and business from flood be sure that my hon friend the minister for water and flooding will be more than happy to meet he to discuss his constituency concern it be not the silver bullet but give the severity of the situation over the weekend every little help will the secretary of state he will earn huge plaudit if he be able to pull this off convince the environment agency that it would be helpful to many community in north dorset the south west and elsewhere to increase the capacity of our river through manage programme of dredging we be lose capacity last week see river where two arch of bridge be entirely silt up that be lose of capacity it be not the silver bullet but capacity improvement would help thank the hon gentleman for his comment know his constituency well and know what champion he be for community there be sure that he will welcome the fact that we be review the formula with the environment agency to look at precisely what action would be most effective to protect community in whichever part of the country they find themselves in include his very beautiful part of dorset last july the previous government issue its third national adaptation plan and this march the climate change committee issue its independent assessment of it say that it fall far short of what be need that it lack the pace and ambition to address grow climate risk which we be already experience and that it fail to set out compelling vision for what the government well adapt uk entail with only around of the short term action to address urgent risk identify in the previous climate change risk assessment will the secretary of state ensure that the key recommendation of the climate change committee in its assessment of be implement and that an urgent refresh of take place to strengthen it and avoid lock in additional climate impact key reform must be implement over the next year along with enforcement those be the recommendation of the climate change committee can he assure the house that he be take those seriously and move they forward my hon friend be right to point to the impact of climate change through the much more frequent severe weather incident that we be see whether drought in the summer or flood at this time of year and through the winter that be why we be review the formula and our approach to manage flooding we take the report and view of the committee very seriously as we continue to look at how good to adapt to the challenge that climate change present to the whole country people live in former mining community across south wales deserve great reassurance on what the government will do about coal tip can the secretary of state explain what exactly they will do to make these tip safe particularly when it come to the live monitoring of any movement and early warning system there be programme to improve the maintenance of coal tip which be underway through the welsh government as say this be the first government to allocate funding to tackle that risk and its very serious implication for people and community live in affected area be grateful to the environment agency for protect much of my constituency however business still continue to flood could the secretary of state say what he be do to review the remit of flood re so that business leaseholder and property build after can be cover by the flood re scheme which really

the impact of storm bert it put out yellow rather than an amber or red warning our constituent have be let down by this incompetence before it can not keep happen my hon friend should be reassure and so should the whole house that in most affected part of the country warning be give with adequate time for people to prepare encourage people to sign up on the website of the department for environment food and rural affairs or of the environment agency for warning and alert if they live in an area that could be affect by flood be aware of the particular concern that my hon friend mention about the met office will indeed be speak to colleague in dsit as they review the circumstance and look at how the situation can be improve for future such event draw the secretary of state attention to what happen after the acute phase of flooding particularly in rural area like mine have small area and village that be affect and then struggle to get thing sort out for example witherley in my constituency be small enough to be affect heavily by flooding that go up through its road but it then struggle to have the capacity to get all the agency to sort it out because of the funding when he look at the funding model will he consider the issue of size also try to pull agency together in one place have take more than year we be meet on december to plan but it have take year of work to get they all together will the secretary of state look at way of ensure that the process be clear so that it be spell out to all the agency include fire agency and water company what they be accountable for everyone and most importantly the public who be affect need to know who be accountable for what commend the hon gentleman for his work in try to bring the agency together in his locality which be precisely what we be try to do at national level with the flood resilience taskforce in fact it would be helpful for the taskforce to look into how co ordination be happen on the ground in locality such as his especially give how long he have be push for this to happen in more effective way so far sadly without success would very much like to see the national taskforce support he in that work so that he can deliver for his local resident in place like ironbridge gorge in my constituency it be day later when the water come down the river and have an impact on business and residence each and every time the temporary flood barrier be erect hammer blow be deal to the economy in this world heritage site will the secretary of state instruct the environment agency to come up with plan and resource for frequently flood area give that year on year the flooding become bad in place like ironbridge gorge invite he to visit the gorge to see it for himself thank my hon friend for his invitation to visit the gorge would very much like to take he up on it when time allow be sure he will welcome the review of the flood funding formula which will allow we to take different approach to manage flooding in way that will be much more effective he should be aware that the environment agency will be conduct its funding allocation in the usual way through its relevant committee and he should feed his view into that process this weekend resident in my constituency be flood yet again the same thing happen only five week ago and after that event meet people at my surgery who show footage of floodwater spew out of their toilet into the downstairs area and of their sodden house meet more than resident in the village of eardisland who express concern that know be widespread in the county and the constituency on that occasion in october more than household in herefordshire be flood yet the flood recovery framework be not initiate because ministers feel that the flooding be not widespread or severe enough will the secretary of state please consider the term under which the flood recovery framework be initiate it provide vital support that council can pass on to help that recovery immediate grant for community and business with council tax and business rate relief will he think about how that be trigger and consider give the responsibility to local authority which be far the well place agency to judge when it be require in addition to everything we need for flood resilience that immediate support be crucial at time like this may extend my sympathy to the hon lady constituent follow the distressing experience that they have undergo during this and be sure previous flooding episode she be quite right to ask how we can improve the flooding formula and get agency work well on the frontline it be possible to do so through the consultation that we have launch on the formula and hope that she will contribute to that be sure we can

my hon friend constituent have experience because of the recent flooding we be review the formula we realise that it be not work as effectively as it should along with the flood resilience taskforce we will be look into how we can well improve co ordination on the ground among the different agency that have responsibility first for keep people safe and then for help community to recover after flooding of the kind that my hon friend describe resident of south abingdon have already be flood twice this year and tonight there be another warning can not imagine what they must be feel when visit they in september they report feel very alone they have be promise flood defence and then the environment agency say that it be not value for money they have be promise sandbank which then do not show up when we ask the ea today whether it would be on the ground it tell we that it could not send enough people not because it do not have the staff or the money but because not enough of they have complete workplace assessment and training on how not to be assault by angry resident of course staff safety be everything and environment agency worker deserve our thank but surely an element of common sense need to be apply surely the good way to help angry resident be to be there and help they in their hour of need be grateful for the point that the hon lady make would be happy to raise it with the chief executive of the environment agency to ensure that when there be an urgent need for support and staff be available to provide it that be what happen thank the secretary of state for

see whether we need to put in place such duty will be sure to keep my hon friend update as those conversation progress couple of week ago hold roundtable with some mid buckinghamshire farmer on the measure require to mitigate flooding especially after extreme weather event such as storm bert this weekend at the top of the list be the point that my hon friend the member for north dorset simon hoare make about dredging and river capacity on top of that however community in buckinghamshire such as calvert green and fleet marston be be flood for the first time in decade as result of some of the big infrastructure that be be build particularly it seem that will concrete over field completely unaware that that will have knock on effect on farmland next door will the secretary of state commit to work with the transport secretary and suggest the deputy prime minister give their plan to concrete over the countryside to ensure that where construction take place there be proper and really mean proper flood mitigation measure the hon gentleman make an important point we need to look at dredging and other mean of mitigate the risk of flooding and he be quite right that that need to be do across government we will have those conversation and will ensure that measure be take to protect community as much as possible from the more severe weather event that we be see as result of climate change as my right hon friend be speak the water level on the river ouse continue to rise which mean that tonight my constituent in newport pagnell be once again brace themselves and prepare

step to safeguard people in newport pagnell in other part of his constituency and indeed along the rest of those river who may be affect as river level continue to rise note from the secretary of state statement that the flood resilience taskforce be design to ensure well co ordination between central government and frontline agency can he advise whether any of those agency local authority or indeed the devolve administration have request military assistance through the maca process if they have be that be consider will he consider include the ministry of defence in his flood resilience taskforce yes the devolved administrations be represent on the flood resilience taskforce we want to co ordinate well with they and to ensure that they be co ordinating with their own agency and the

collaboration be see in northampton demonstrate the importance of the flood resilience taskforce that he have announce which will bring together multiple agency to protect town such as mine have the pleasure of visit the aquadrome and be very sad indeed to hear that it have be flood yet again my hon friend be right to point to the fact that it be not just about increase funding important though that be it be also about get the agency on the ground to co ordinate well at national regional and very local level we have flood alert in runnymede and weybridge at the moment but it take few day for the water to make its way down to we so we do not know the full impact of storm bert we hope that there will not be repeat of what happen with storm henk early this year when constituent be pass from pillar to post due to the myriad statutory responder during flood emergency what will the flood resilience taskforce do to fix that and will the secretary of state support my campaign for an individual point of contact and co ordination we need flood control centre in runnymede and weybridge and in all our constituency to support our resident in flood emergency the role of the flood resilience taskforce be to ensure not just that there be well co ordination at national level and between national and local agency but that co ordination happen far well at the local level in the way that he be describe and that there be much well communication with resident so that they know who to contact and can do so in much simple way to get the support and help that they need both when flood be come and as area recover from the impact of flooding one of the way in which my hazel grove constituent have be impact by storm bert be as passenger face severe delay and cancellation on our rail

minimise the impact and on how to ensure that we learn the right lesson so that future flooding cause even few impact we be in close contact with colleague in the department for transport and safety must be the priority for both passenger and people who work as part of the crew on the train or on the ground the railway line will be open as soon as it be safe to do so we be aware that further step need to be take to protect all form of public transport and indeed all part of the country from the increase in severe weather incident the flooding minister the hon member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice recently confirm to that the government new flood resilience taskforce bring together range of partner include the environment agency the devolve administrations select regional mayors and lead local flood authority however follow flooding in brampton and st ives that be cause by the high level of the river great ouse last month cambridgeshire county council inform that its role as lead local flood authority be only support one and resident have be understandably frustrate by the lack of clarity about who own what can the secretary of state offer some clarity on which agency lead the multi agency response during flooding event and how be that reflect in how it interact with the flood resilience taskforce be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise that important point part of the role of the flood resilience taskforce will be to ensure that there be clarity on the ground area by area as to who be the lead responder and how co ordination be happen in way that will provide the maximum benefit to people who be at risk of be affect by flooding hope that the secretary of state will join in thank worker at torbay council who have step up to help out resident across my constituency during storm bert highlight to colleague the fact that we be haunt by deep cut to the flood defence budget under the previous government will the secretary of state reflect on piece of critical infrastructure our dawlish rail line phase of the dawlish rail resilience programme remain up on the shelf and have not be fund yet will he give assurance that it will be fund to protect this vital piece of infrastructure share the hon gentleman thank to those who have be involve in protect people from the impact of flooding can write to he on his specific question about the dawlish railway remind member that be chair of the all party parliamentary group on flooding and flooded community large area of north shropshire be often under water either from river flooding or from prolonged rainfall this weekend have be no exception with villager cut off for long period of time and vast swathe of farmland flood this year there be farmer who have be unable to plant crop in the current harvest which have just be collect and who will not be able to do so next year they be in desperate state when the secretary of state review the flooding formula and the funding will he consider how farmer will be compensate for store vast quantity of water upstream regardless of whether they like it or not we can take that into account when we look at the flooding formula but be sure the hon lady will welcome as do the additional million in the budget for farmer who have be affect by the severe level of flooding experience early in the year the advice from great western railway this morning be not to travel follow the question from my hon friend the member for hazel grove lisa smart how many meeting have the secretary of state have with the transport secretary about

to forecast how we can lower and slow the flood crest through witney which would make it safe will the secretary of state please look into provide well funding or enlarge the funding for such modelling so that we can keep town such as witney safe on river like the windrush recognise the hon gentleman point we will make announcement on fipl early in the new year finally call jim shannon everybody know that when be call it be all over almost laughter thank the secretary of state for bring forward very positive action plan and strategy send my sincere sympathy to those who have lose love one and to those who be particularly anxious worried and depressed about their property that be serious worry for people who do not know what they will do next will the secretary of state outline what discussion have take place with counterpart in the northern ireland assembly to ensure that the assembly and local community have the ability to quickly regroup and get handle on the devastating flooding that have take place throughout the united kingdom also need to ask he question that wish have the answer to one of the big question be about alternative accommodation for those who have be flood out have he be able to give any attention to that question and if so will the answer be share with the people back home they say it not over till the fat lady sing but be not sure that they have the hon gentleman in mind when that particular phrase be coin be in regular contact with the devolved authority include on flooding they sit on the flood resilience taskforce and it be important that there be co ordination across all part of government across the uk to ensure that we can provide appropriate support for people in precisely the circumstance that he describe when flooding hit point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker on saturday there be several incident of greater manchester police violently restrict young romany gypsy and irish traveller child who have come into manchester city centre to do christmas shopping video footage depict group of romany gypsy and irish traveller child be dangerously force on to train out of the city to station unknown with one child

and decision make process this have cause huge distress for the many young people involve for their family and for those across the romany gypsy and irish traveller community therefore madam deputy speaker may seek your guidance on how we can encourage the home office to make statement and to consider an investigation into the incident be grateful to the hon member for give prior notice of her point of order have not have any indication that the home secretary intend to come to the house to make statement but the hon member have put her point on the record and be sure that those on the treasury bench will note her comment and pass they on non domestic rating multipliers and private schools bill second read the reasoned amendment in the name of kevin hollinrake have be select beg to move that the bill be now read second time last month the chancellor set out the government first budget that budget be once in generation event to wipe the slate clean after year of the conservatives at that budget we lay the foundation for our no mission of economic growth the scale of the mess that we inherit at the general election mean that we have to take tough decision on welfare spending and tax those decision have be difficult but they be necessary they have enable we to deliver economic stability and fix the public finance do that be crucial to get public service back on their foot and to give business the confidence they need to invest and thrive stability certainty and predictability be highly prize by business when make decision about where and how much to invest in opposition speak to business time and again about the importance of stability so in government we have make sure to deliver for they by publish our corporate tax road map alongside the budget in my meeting with business about what they need to succeed the system of business rate also come up time and again hear business criticise system that be inflexible that disincentivise investment and that place an unfair burden on those business on high street across england that be why in the budget the chancellor confirm our first step towards create fairer business rate system that protect the high street support investment and be fit for the century we be determined to support high street as they be place that bring people together and serve as focal point for economic activity their success be what people across the country want to see and it be priority for the government to deliver it that be why in our first bill on business rate in this parliament the government have prioritise make progress to rebalance the rate burden face by high street business the bill before we seek to put into law the commitment make at the budget by enable the introduction from of permanently low tax rate for the retail hospitality and leisure property with rateable value below that make up the backbone of high street across england we be determined to give those business tax cut and we know that that must be fully fund in challenging fiscal context for that reason the bill also enable we to generate sustainable funding for those tax cut through an increase of multiplier on the most valuable of business property in the country this target approach capture the majority of large distribution warehouse include those use by online giant as well as other out of town business that draw footfall away from high street it will enable we to lock in new permanently low tax rate for core high street business provide not only tax cut but stability and certainty after the one year retail hospitality and leisure relief which have be precariously extended year by year since the pandemic our approach provide permanent tax cut to help high street business succeed alongside the certainty that they need to invest and the mean to pay for it within our tough fiscal rule the minister talk about certainty but one of the big problem for small business be that so many thing be happen at once include the national insurance contribution increase the employment rights bill that be come in and now the levy that have be cut down from to the cumulative effect of all those make massive difference for my business hairdresser that meet only this weekend talk about how much of problem that will be how do the measure help to engender stability for those small business which have to wait until let remind the hon gentleman that around the difficult decision that we have to take on employer national insurance contribution we provide explicit protection for small business by more than double the employment allowance from to which will benefit hundred of thousand of small business across the country suggest that he talk to business in his constituency about that we be not shy away from the fact that difficult decision be take in the budget but he might also consult the plan that be leave in operation by the previous government in july if we have pursue those plan and if we have not take any action on business rate the retail hospitality and leisure relief would have end entirely next april the cliff edge loom next april would have see it go down to zero we have extend it despite the tough fiscal circumstance for another year at that be reasonable way forward while we put in place these permanent reform as mention the measure in the bill to level the play field for high street be the beginning of our effort to transform the system of business rate our ambition to go far be set out in the paper publish alongside the budget transform business rate that paper set out the government priority area for further reform to support investment and make the system fair it invite business and industry representative to work with we on design the good possible system for the future be grateful to all those business and representative body that have speak with in the last few week for their engagement already we will consider what more the government should do to incentivise investment and growth include by look at the efficacy of improvement relief and empty property relief the impact of lose small business rate relief on expand business and the cliff edge within the current system if the minister be look for other method by which public finance could be effectively deploy will he look carefully at the last decade during which small business rate relief have be use by second home owner to flip their property to business rating and pay nothing at all in cornwall alone that have result in over million of taxpayer money be pay out to wealthy second home owner through covid aid and the small business rate relief will he look at how wealthy people have be incentivise to use that method to their advantage will he ensure that we have much fair system that put first home before second home the hon gentleman raise crucial point about ensure that the tax system be fair and that it support the behaviour that we seek to incentivise that lead neatly to my next point as part of the discussion paper on transform business rate we have commit to consult on adopt general anti avoidance rule for business rate in england although that might not necessarily address the exact problem the hon gentleman highlight it speak to the general issue of avoidance in relation to business rate we will also look at how the burden adjust with the economic cycle and we will assess the merit of further increase in the frequency of re evaluation look forward to work closely with business and representative organisation to deliver business rate system that be fit for the century and that work begin today with the power in this bill to deliver our permanent tax cut for high street as say early the tough decision that the chancellor set out in the budget to deliver economic stability and fix the public finance enable we to give business the confidence they need to invest and to get public service back on their foot one public service that be crucial to break down barrier to opportunity be the education system which be why the government have prioritise ensure that every child have access to the high quality education that they deserve like other have repeatedly raise the need for exemption for religious school for the free presbyterian church in northern ireland for example the expression of its faith and treasured belief do not sit comfortably with mainstream schooling and it be the same for many other faith if the government be determined to press ahead do the minister agree that exemption must be make at the very least for such school on behalf of those church those faith and those people have to say that the government must think again thank the hon gentleman for rare intervention but this bill be about business rate in england some of his wide point may relate to the removal of the vat exemption for private school fee in other country and nation of the uk those provision will be debate as part of the finance bill on wednesday and if he repeat his comment might be able to address they more specifically today we be address the business rate system that apply in england this be important because every parent aspire to get the good education for their child and we as government be determined to ensure that those aspiration be meet at the budget the government announce real term increase in per pupil funding with billion increase to the core school budget for the financial year include billion uplift in high need funding this funding increase need to be pay for so to help make that happen the government be end the tax break for private school as set out in our manifesto this include end charitable rate relief eligibility for those private school in england that be charity this bill will do that and its measure operate alongside the ending of the vat exemption for private school fee which be be deliver through the finance bill that will be move on wednesday together these measure will raise billion year by the bill make provision for maintain the charitable status of institution that be wholly or mainly concerned with provide full time education for pupil with an education health and care plan will the minister set out the definition of wholly or mainly what support will be put in place for council to afford the burden of extra pupil move into mainstream education school will be face the double whammy of lose charitable status and vat be impose on school fee hampshire county council be already under financial strain and it will face crisis point by under these proposal as will explain the test of wholly or mainly concerned be of pupil or more have an ehcp specify that their educational need can be meet only in private school will provide some more detail in moment of course the government have prioritise funding for the state education system in this budget the billion increase include billion uplift in high need funding be possible only because of the difficult decision that we have take on taxation include in the bill do the minister agree that the budget prioritisation of state school should be welcome have talk to teacher in harlow and under this labour government they feel hope for the first time in year be it not shock that the conservative party be still bemoan the removal of tax exemption from private school rather than focus on the mainstream education attend by of child my hon friend be right that we as government be focus on improve state education for child across the country because we know that every parent aspire for their child to get the good possible education that be what our plan seek to achieve and would welcome it if the opposition support our effort for the good of child across the country member will have the chance to scrutinise the detail of this bill in committee but will now spend few moment outline how the bill provision be intend to operate do the minister recognise that many independent school such as lady eleanor holles school and hampton school in my constituency be involve in huge amount of partnership work with school in disadvantaged area like feltham reach academy to help disadvantaged child to have opportunity that they would not otherwise get do he recognise that both the measure in this bill and the introduction of vat on private school fee will lessen that partnership work which will have detrimental impact on many state school thank the hon lady for her intervention but what will have positive impact on state school across the country be the extra funding that we announce in the budget if opposition member want to support extra funding for school they have to support some of the tough decision to raise that revenue in the first place they can not have it both way know the new leader of the opposition be very keen to oppose tax rise while claim that she support the investment but she can not have it both way if opposition member want to support extra funding for school the nhs and other public service they have to have some responsibility and accept the decision that we be take or propose some of their own will the minister confirm the continuation of small business rate relief for the rest of this parliament will come to business rate the hon gentleman will have chance to respond in full in just moment interruption see that he be impatient to tell we how much he support the bill or be misread the sign from across the dispatch box as have say this bill will enable the introduction of new multiplier in the business rate system from the provision in this bill will enable the introduction of two low tax rate which may be apply only to qualify retail hospitality and leisure property the definition of qualifying property will ultimately be set out in secondary legislation but for the avoidance of doubt it be our intention that the scope of these new tax rate will broadly follow that use for current retail hospitality and leisure relief these new rate will provide permanent tax cut offer certainty to business by end the continued uncertainty of retail hospitality and leisure relief which have be roll over annually since our intention be for low rate that offer tax cut for retail hospitality and leisure property that currently pay the standard multipli with rateable value between and another rate will offer large cut to the retail hospitality and leisure property currently pay the small business multipli which be those with rateable value below we be clear however that any tax cut must be sustainably fund for that reason the bill will also enable the introduction of high multiplier which can be apply only to the most valuable property those with rateable value of and above which represent less than of all property in england the rate for any new multiplier will be set in the autumn budget in the light of the outcome of the revaluation the government recognise however that it would be inappropriate to take unfettered power that allow the government to change tax liability by unlimited amount for that reason the bill include sensible guardrail to limit the use of those power the guardrail determine that the two low tax rate when introduce may not be set low than below the small business non domestic rating multiplier and that the high tax rate when introduce may not be set high than above the non domestic rating multiplier let make it clear that those value be maximum parameter and do not represent the change that we intend to implement they be guardrail that offer sensible limit with proportionate flexibility they ensure that the government can respond to future revaluation as well as the change economic and fiscal context as say the exact rate for will be set out in next year budget alongside the provision on multiplier the bill contain provision relate to private school that will raise around million year there be more than private school in england of which approximately half be charity and be able to benefit from business rate charitable relief the bill will remove the eligibility of private school that be charity for that relief the bill provide specific definition of private school as school at which full time education be provide for pupil of compulsory school age where fee or other consideration be payable for that education or an institution which be wholly or mainly concerned with provide education suitable to the requirement of person over compulsory school age but under where the provision of full time education be wholly or mainly provision in respect of which fee or other consideration be payable number of right hon and hon member have question how the government plan will affect pupil with special educational need and disability my official and carefully consider the design of the policy and the provision in the bill mean that private school that be charity that wholly or mainly provide education for pupil with an education health and care plan will remain eligible for charitable rate relief to be clear in answer to the early question from the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage wholly or mainly in business rate generally mean or more the government believe that will ensure that the majority of special educational need school will not be affect by the measure the measure will operate in addition to the exist business rate exemption for property use by private school wholly for the training or welfare of disabled people that exemption which we be retain mean that those type of property pay no business rate at all take together the exist and new provision be intend to ensure that most private special educational need school will not be affect by the removal of charitable rate relief give the terrible send crisis across the country do the minister really think that it be good enough that only most of those school will be exempt hope that the hon member will welcome the fact that we have commit an extra billion in to high need funding in the education system the government be commit to reform england send provision to improve outcome and return the system to financial sustainability would welcome her support for our measure in that regard appreciate the minister make this carve out on send but would be grateful if he could give we some statistic he say that most will be carve out have the government do any work to determine how many school will still fall under the provision if not place such an impact assessment in the library would be useful for member across the house let point the hon gentleman to document that have already be publish removal of eligibility of private school for business rate charitable relief which set out the impact and all the figure that he request there be private school in england of they be charity and we expect that under our plan will lose the relief the school that be wholly or mainly concerned with provision for child with an ehcp that specify that their educational need can be meet only in private school will retain access to charitable rate relief hope that that document will give he some of the statistic that he request let add few more detail in case they help hon member in understand the policy can confirm that stand alone nursery with their own rate bill be not within the scope of the bill if they be charity they will retain their eligibility for the exist relief in addition the bill reference independent training provider which provide valuable vocational training course on behalf of the government ensure that there be suitable further education opportunity for all because of the funding mechanism use by the government to fund independent training provider to provide full time education and training for to year old the bill provide specific carve out to ensure that those institution will not be affect by the measure in the bill as previously announce it be the government intention that this measure will come into effect from april as business rate be devolved tax the measure in the bill will apply only in england the measure in the bill will play their part in bring about the change that the government be elect to deliver the power to introduce new multiplier serve as first step on the road to transform the business rate system we be determined to transform the business rate system to support our high street in sustainable way to offer stability and promote investment and to drive the economic growth that be our mission as government our vision of modern business rate system be one that help to create wealth and decent job in every part of the country and that ensure that high street serve as the heart of local community we be also determined to break down barrier to opportunity and help all parent to achieve their aspiration for their child that be why the bill will make change to the relief from business rate that private school that be charity currently enjoy raise crucial funding to help to ensure that every child have access to the high quality education that they deserve the bill deliver change change be what the british people vote for and commend the bill to the house call the opposition spokesperson beg to move an amendment to leave out from that to the end of the question and add this house observe that the autumn budget have cut central government funding for retail hospitality and leisure business rate relief in and that this government funding will end completely in express concern that the non domestic rating multipliers and private schools bill represent stealth increase in business rate on high street and the hospitality sector as well as on large business on top of the government increase in national insurance contribution regret the lack of proper cumulative impact assessment on the effect on business note that the removal of charitable rate relief on independent school take together with the imposition of vat will mean few child go to private school and will therefore create extra pressure on state school will undermine aspiration and parental choice and mean large class size in state school and increase cost for taxpayer and therefore decline to give second reading to the non domestic rating multipliers and private schools bill it be privilege to speak in this debate on behalf of his majesty opposition the conservative party have proud record of support business on the high street we cut business rate to support small business include double small business rate relief from up to and almost treble high rate relief from to we increase the frequency of business rate revaluation make our business rate system fair for business and more responsive to local economic trend help business to invest create job and grow the contrast with this business bash labour government could not be great they have bring forward mass of new red tape for business by mean of the employment rights bill note that the regulatory policy committee release its commentary today on the impact assessment which it say be not fit for purpose it say that the annual cost to business could be much high than billion and the impact assessment have receive red rating the government have also impose huge new tax increase on business the bad thing be that they be not even man enough to tell business that they be go to do it quite the opposite which be why as much as the minister say that business have confidence in his plan the institute of directors have say that it have see the big one month fall in investment confidence in its history the confederation of british industry say today that of its member will reduce headcount and two third be scale back hiring be that the kind of growth that he imagine he would bring forward with his legislation infamously the labour party promise in its manifesto not to raise national insurance next week we will have the second reading of bill that renege completely on that promise by raise employer national insurance contribution by billion year labour have also hit business through the family farm tax and our good family business in other sector by halve business property relief remind the minister that family business employ million people in this country and pay over billion every year in taxis the government be kill the goose that lie the golden egg in its manifesto the labour party promise to replace the business rate system so we can raise the same revenue but in fair way this new system will level the play field between the high street and online giant in speech to the house on may the deputy prime minister say we would scrap business rate to help our high street flourish official report may vol the treasury minister himself also state his party intention to scrap business rate to the house on october the bill before we break those promise because it do not replace or scrap the business rate system not only that but as result of the bill and the measure in the budget business rate be actually go up both for online company and business on our local high street yet more broken promise from government of broken promise maybe the government do not realise exactly what they be do perhaps because member of their cabinet have no experience of start and run business shamefully there have be no consultation with business about the change true to form the government have not publish full regulatory impact assessment alongside the bill on the change to business rate multiplier it be discourtesy to the house and to our constituent for the government to refuse to consult with business consider the impact their policy will have or publish the information that would allow members of the house to scrutinise the plan properly instead they be use their majority to ram through the half bake damaging measure in the bill find it more than ludicrous to hear the tories lecture labour about red tape what the tories have serve up to the country through brexit and the damage they have do to our economy be disaster to hear they masquerade as order only intervention relevant to the speech in hand should be make there be no need for that performance be grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention remind he that it be not the conservative party that vote to leave the european union but the people of this country we respect democratic mandate hope every member on the government benches who walk through the lobby to support the bill tonight realise the price their constituent will pay for that decision if the government will not publish the likely consequence of the bill let set out what believe the consequence will be the government claim to be cut business rate relief for retail hospitality and leisure business in england but that be not the case the business rate relief for retail hospitality and leisure business that we introduce cut off bill but that support be be reduce by the labour government they be almost halve that relief to mean that shop restaurant cafés pub cinema music venue gym and hotel will all see their business rate rise be that business rate relief for retail hospitality and leisure business due to expire in april as the minister know it have be renew every year since the conservative party support business when that be pass on in england the same money be provide to scotland and wales what do wales do only relief be pass on not that be the welsh government attitude to business the conservative party support business but the labour party do not because it do not understand they business face stealth tax from labour with million rise in rate next year that will add more than to the business rate bill for the average pub on top of per year in extra cost for national insurance rise it will also add more than to the rate bill for the average restaurant on top of the national insurance increase which mean an additional in total per annum for typical business there will also be an increase of up to billion in through high business rate via the new multiplier despite labour manifesto promise not to increase the amount raise by the levy these tax rise as the cbi have say again today will be pass on to worker through low wage and to consumer through high price make mockery of labour claim that it would not raise taxis for work people the british retail consortium have warn the government the sheer scale of new cost and the speed with which they occur create cumulative burden that will make job loss inevitable and high price certainty the bill will replace retail hospitality and leisure relief with low multipli for business with rateable value below that will be fund by the new high rate multiplier for premise with rateable value of more than as the minister set out set the threshold at that high level be blunt instrument can assure the government that it will have consequence for business that be not big online retailer it will hit large supermarket supermarket delivery large department store football and cricket club conference centre and airport some of those on whom the new charge will be levy pay ten or hundred of million of pound in rate at the maximum level it will mean increase to their rate bill it be no wonder that the outgoing chief executive of john lewis have criticise labour lack of business rate reform and warn that alongside the national insurance increase this be two handed grab from business the cold chain federation have warn that the business rate change and the nic increase could lead to the cost of food and medicine go up that might be double whammy for consumer as the national farmers union have warn that the cost of food will go up because of the family farm tax the labour government do not seem to have think that through the labour party use to say that the business rate system create uncertainty but now kpmg have describe the government plan to change the business rate system as set out in the bill as create uncertainty for business the bill be silent on the matter of small business rate relief which be lifeline for many business on our high street when the minister for local government and english devolution wind up the debate will he confirm that the government intend to retain small business rate relief for the rest of this parliament business be listen and it need to know let address the sting in the tail of the bill labour education tax the shadow education secretary my right hon friend the member for sevenoaks laura trott feel passionately as do all conservative members that the government be make the wrong decision this bill be part of the government education tax because remove the charitable rate relief from private school that be charity go hand in glove with the utterly wrong headed anti aspirational and counterproductive policy of charge vat on private school fee will the shadow minister tell we how many state school there be in his constituency and whether he will talk so passionately about they when he talk about the decision that this government be make to support state school the bill be about raise rate on private school which be why mention they but be very happy to talk in glow term about the state school in my constituency include the one that attend as boy and the one that my child go to be for state school but be also for independent education why be it either or why would anyone ever tax education the stop school cuts campaign website estimate the combined school cut since in thirsk and malton the shadow minister constituency as more than will he point to where in the public record he have speak out about that be part of the fair funding formula for school in my area which have the worst fund local authority in the country reassure the hon gentleman that school in my constituency improve under the stewardship of the conservative government surely that be the key metric rather than just how much money be put in the impact of tax private school with vat will be that thousand of pupil move out into the state system that will take away funding it be already have an impact but no mitigation have be put in place the education secretary say that be not the correct number but she would not give out the number of pupil who have move the government know those number and they need to come clean because the impact of those pupil move will eat away at whatever the tax raise my hon friend be absolutely right understand that pupil will be transfer to the state sector as result of these plan we conservative hold firmly to the principle that education should not be tax the only other nation to have try be greece which abandon the policy within month because of the disastrous consequence the independent schools council have say that some independent school will close entirely and other will scale back the education they offer cause significant upheaval and disruption to the life of ten of thousand of child as surely as night follow day that will mean few child go to private school and increase pressure on state school would be grateful if the minister enlighten about whether this policy complie with article of the european convention on human right the legal issue memorandum consider the principle of non discrimination regard the difference in treatment between private school and state school but not between private school that be charity and other charity that will still qualify for charitable rate relief look forward to the minister clarification during our time in government england become one of the top perform country for education in the western world legacy that this government seem determined to trash in short this bill may be short but it be long on disastrous consequence implore government member to think about their local school and their high street business that be about to be clobber and about the result job loss high price and board up shop front ask all member to think about what be in their constituent good interest do the right thing and vote against the bill will focus on the removal of private school eligibility for charitable business rate relief before be elect to the house be scientist but before be scientist train as secondary school teacher in school see at first hand the dedication and resilience of my colleague but also bear witness to the challenge that they face challenge that lead many many teacher to leave the profession after only few year leave after only my training year cite the unsustainability of mark book at in the morning planning lesson at the weekend and never see my family as the reason why could not continue in the profession despite love be teacher choose to leave the profession to do something that feel be much easy to take doctorate in engineering when train year ago teaching have profound retention issue but now it be bad one in new teacher leave after just one year in the role one in four leaf after just three year little over half of teacher see their career last more than year many be outstanding teacher who do not want to leave the profession even now miss teach every day the picture in our education system get bad when we look at math and science subject that know the whole house believe be vital the math teacher shortage begin in and in the intake of new math teacher be just of the government target be physics teacher and in there be six time as many vacancy for science teacher as there be in in my view the failure of the previous government education policy lead to this abysmal state of affair and they be profoundly unacceptable appreciate that the hon gentleman be talk from personal experience about an important part of our education system he talk lot about teacher and the previous government fail education policy but will he take moment to recognise the vast improvement in our performance in international league table and the fall in the disadvantage gap in the year lead up to will he at least give some credit to the output not just the input will come to some of those point far on in my speech if the hon gentleman be willing to hang on for few minute train as teacher when the former member of parliament for surrey heath be education secretary he make significant change to the education system during his tenure as the hon member for central suffolk and north ipswich patrick spencer have just allude to those be change that and the vast majority of my colleague at the time strongly disagree with those change ignore decade of pedagogical research and favour the metrification of our child over learn they hark back to the rote learning of year ago and set pedagogy back decade austerity be already be very much feel in the sector teacher be expect to put in the same effort but with few resource and with their pay freeze now it be bad after decade of conservative education secretaries follow in the footstep of the former member for surrey heath teacher pay have take significant real term cut in many way he inspire to enter politic as labour member sentiment that know many of my colleague on this side of the house share opposition members may challenge about why raise these point but think they be all part of what the bill be about they be about keep teacher in their job pay they fairly and give they the resource that they need to give our child the education that they deserve the previous government set goal that all child should finish year with at least gcse in math and english that be laudable goal which have my full personal support but last year just of child in england not even half achieve it only one state secondary school in my constituency of erewash attain result above that average and even in that top perform school just half their child in year attain gcse in math and english every other state secondary school in my constituency be below that average and at the worst perform the result be few than third should note that place none of the blame for those issue on the local school themselves have meet several local head and many teacher all of whom it be powerfully obvious to have make incredible sacrifice to deliver excellence in our local education system and all of whom have be burn by the failure of education reform introduce throughout the past decade the people of erewash elect conservative member of parliament in and and in return the previous government let their child down have be talk lot about state school which be only natural when they be the school that of our child attend but would also like to highlight the major independent school in my constituency trent college in long eaton in the run up to the election and since then have be around as many of the school in erewash as can and trent college be no exception have speak many time to staff and pupil and this weekend attend show put on by the incredible wildflower community choir at the school chapel it be wonderful school with excellent staff lead by the brilliant bill penty the staff provide fantastic opportunity to all the pupil who attend the facility be the good have ever see in school and the staff do huge amount for our community but it be simple fact that the vast majority of my constituent can not afford to send their child to trent college and that many of its pupil come from outside my constituency great part of what this bill be about be make sure that the incredible opportunity receive by the child at trent college and the aspiration that they be encourage to have be available to all child in erewash want every child in erewash and the country to receive the good education they possibly can this bill will support the extension of those opportunity to every child in every state school in erewash and the country the hon gentleman be give thoughtful and impassioned speech notwithstanding his support for the government policy wonder whether he regret the fact that it be be introduce midway through the year so that child include those with special educational need will find themselves struggle to get involve with the curriculum and to fulfil the examination for which they have put in lot of effort and preparation remind the right hon gentleman that if opposition members do not want we to have to take drastic measure to re establish our country economy they should not have leave billion black hole in it want to flag particular failure in the education system that be bring to crisis by the previous government the provision of send education it have long be under support and after the past decade thing be bad opposition members will claim that the bill will make send provision bad still let tell they that for send child and their family in my constituency and across derbyshire it be scarcely conceivable that thing could get any bad some of the casework that receive in my office relate to send problem the recent ofsted report on send service offer by conservative run derbyshire county council find that it have widespread weakness that communication with parent be poor and that child need be often not accurately identify or provide for the report be utterly damning it be the bad ofsted report have ever see and derbyshire county council failure be extreme for my constituent the local election can not come soon enough be very pleased when the chancellor announce in the budget an extra billion to support send service have speak extensively to parent of send child in my constituency can say that they be not worried about whether private school fee might increase they be worried about whether their child will be able to go to school at all this bill be about provide equality of opportunity it be about ensure that child postcode or their parent income do not determine their chance in life this bill will provide fund to fix our state school reverse the bite of austerity get more teacher into school and help they to stay there ensure that all child be properly include and ultimately provide they with the education they all deserve feel strongly that support this bill be my duty to my erewash constituent and to its school its teacher its child their parent and the future of our town and village it be my duty therefore to vote for the bill call the liberal democrat spokesperson the great british high street be on life support many brick and mortar business be barely survive and where they be it be often against the odd change in our trading relationship with europe the pandemic energy price the cost of living and the conservatives disastrous mini budget have all take their toll but for year one measure have stifle high street business more than any other the broken business rate system the business rate system be unfair on company bad for our local community and damage to our national economy it penalise manufacturer when they invest to become more productive and energy efficient it leave pub and restaurant with disproportionately high tax bill and it put brick and mortar shop at an unfair disadvantage compare with online retail giant in too many place pub restaurant and shop be be force to close take with they job opportunity and treasured community space and consumer be see the cost of this unfair tax pass on to they more broadly this outdated system inhibit business investment job creation and economic growth hold back our national economy yet for too long it have be allow to continue in their manifesto the previous conservative government promise fundamental review of business rate to ease the tax burden on small business yet in when challenge the then chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt on his personal commitment to make that happen he admit in this place that it be another of the promise now vainly wish have not report october vol business be tired of be treat with such cynicism and of rely on patchwork of last minute temporary relief they can not plan they can not invest and they can not grow they be cry out for fundamental reform and new fairer system before this autumn budget liberal democrats call on the chancellor to reform business rate completely with new system and to do so no later than april we believe the new system should be base on our liberal democrat call for commercial landowner levy bold move that would deliver real shot in the arm for our high street instead of pursue fundamental reform instead of fair reform this bill be just more tinkering rate relief have be stick plaster but boy be that plaster be rip off in april with big reduction in relief many small business now say that the increase in business rate combine with the increase in national insurance contribution will be too much for they to absorb my hon friend be make an excellent case along with the point make in my previous intervention about the opportunity for abuse under the rate relief system particularly by holiday home do she accept that the methodology use by the current rating system for parking space in out of town retail outlet such as supermarket hand massive advantage to those supermarket in comparison with town centre shop and that we need rating system that actually levy rate on that benefit at level that ensure an even play field my hon friend be absolutely right that this break business rate system be unfair in many way and it be the big giant online or otherwise that be get an easy ride the bill fail to address many other problem with business rate for example it do nothing to support business outside the three sector of retail hospitality and leisure mean it exclude key sector such as manufacturing that be particularly negatively affect by the current system it do not address the cliff edge property with value over that threshold be not eligible for the small business multiplier even though they be small business and with rate relief go down business rate bill for small business will go up from next april business rate relief for retail hospitality and leisure will be cut from to and this bill do nothing to avert that blow the minister say he want to rebalance business rate welcome that direction of travel if it turn out to be true but in the absence of an impact assessment be particularly worried about unintended consequence say this in the spirit of constructive opposition it appear as though the government be move from system of temporary relief to low multipli at the moment small business enjoy business rate relief but very large chain have its relief cap at if have understand it correctly independent shop will see their relief drop from to while big chain such as pubcos and supermarket may see their relief uncap which could give they tax reduction of ten of million of pound would be grateful if the minister write to to share some modelling to reassure that that be not go to happen and that we will not see independent business inadvertently subsidise big chain store and multinational the impact of the government change to business rate will have massive effect on small business in my constituency the old pub in britain or so they claim ye olde fighting cocks will see whopping increase of per year in its business rate alone the save st albans pubs campaign say that even an average pub in st albans with rateable value of will face an additional in its business rate bill from april if we assume that an average pub make profit per pint each of those pub would need to sell an extra pint year or almost pint extra week and that be before factor in the increase in national insurance contribution other low margin large premise business such as child soft play activity centre will also lose out under these change dj play run much love indoor play centre across hertfordshire which exist in large warehouse style premise the building be large but the profit margin be not dj play and many other like it provide valuable and enrich educational experience for child but they too will struggle to keep their head above water the liberal democrats be also oppose to the bill because it would levy tax on education by remove the business rate exemption for private school that be charity we be oppose in principle to the taxation of education because it be public good we believe that parent must be give choice when it come to their child education many family feel that whether due to bullying send provision mental health issue or other factor the state system can not meet their child need one of the first thing the coalition government vote to do be to scrap the building schools for the future programme which impact school in my constituency include calder high school brooksbank and todmorden high school will the hon lady reflect on whether that be mistake by her party and whether it have prevent state school from be able to provide for more student be grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention he may know that during those coalition year both the health and education day to day budget be protect and it be after the liberal democrats leave the coalition in that capital budget be serially raid to pay for day to day spending to return to my point there be almost child with send in private education without education health and care plan and it will be those family who bear the brunt of this measure we liberal democrats have table our own reason amendment set out the reason why we be against the bill but have number of question for the minister that would be grateful if he could address in his sum up will there be an impact assessment that set out the impact on small business on high street will he exclude any new investment from business rate valuation from april so that business that be able to invest in their future will not see that investment push up their rate bill even high will he think again and complete the consultation before unfreeze the rate relief which could badly affect small business and our high street will he confirm whether the change from system of capped temporary relief to an uncapped lower multipli will inadvertently end up with small business subsidise big corporation the government say that they want growth and so do we but these business rate change will stifle the growth of small business and high street at time when we should be unleash it we urge ministers to think again like my hon friend the member for erewash adam thompson will speak about the removal of the charitable tax status of private school stand here as not just the labour mp for wolverhampton north east but someone who have spend more than year work in state secondary school as science teacher and deputy headteacher my experience in classroom have show the stark reality of the funding disparity across our education system remove the charitable tax status of private school be necessary and fair many staff work in state school across the country will empathise with when say that in recent year something as basic as class set of glue stick or reliable access to working printer have become luxury we have to make tough choice we be struggle to provide subject and department capitation budget for subject such as science art design and technology and music and to provide the resource need for student to thrive with hand on learning we be struggle to fix leak roof and fund much need support service for vulnerable student these be not decision that any school leader should face but they be the reality in too many state school contrast that with the resource available to private school which benefit from the charitable tax exemption give they financial advantage be it fair that while state school struggle to afford basic supply private school enjoy tax break that widen the gap think not the gulf in top gcse result between private school and state school be vast this year almost of the gcse take by private school student be at least grade while less than of result from student in comprehensive and academy reach the same level by remove tax exemption on private school we have the opportunity to generate an estimate more than billion annually those fund will catalyse the transformation need in our state school imagine recruit and retain more talented teacher modernise age building expand student wraparound support service and ensure that every child no matter where they be from have access to high quality education this be not about punishment it be about fairness some will argue that this policy could drive up fee put private education out of reach for some family but let we be clear private school be business many have financial reserve endowment and donation that they can draw on they can adapt just as state school and school leader like myself have have to adapt and balance constrain budget for many year this new government record on education will be one of fairness and equity we be invest in early year education free breakfast club great quality apprenticeship and staff recruitment and retention but we need resource to make those ambition reality remove charitable tax exemption be necessary and responsible step in build an education system in which child potential be not define by their family wealth have see what state school can achieve when they be give the resource they deserve when child who once struggle to find their confidence suddenly excel because they finally have the support that they need remove tax exemption from private school be not just policy to for the student have teach the colleague have work alongside and the countless young people still wait for their opportunity this be about fairness just as they deserve in my time as junior treasury minister one important thing learn be that there be really good argument against every tax vat be inflationary corporation tax reduce investment income tax disincentivise work excise duty typically fall more heavily on low income group and so on as result the policy tend to be we will do little bit of large number of taxis that be not bad policy but business rate be particularly troublesome because of their fix cost nature they do not flex to business sale or profitability or to the business cycle so they can exacerbate the effect of downturn in the economy or in individual sector business rate discourage start up and scale up rate fall disproportionately on property heavy sector with the development of commerce and delivery business the hurt to those with costly premise be relatively great due to the accumulation of those factor ukhospitality and the british retail consortium estimate that hospitality retail and leisure account for more than third of business rate while account for under tenth of the economy as whole that matter to we as parliamentarian because of the role that such business play in our town centre village centre city centre and high street there be both the direct effect that an individual shop café restaurant or pub have on footfall into the town and the indirect impact due to the interdependence of business and the network effect we often lump hospitality and retail together due to the commonality of pressure that affect both but there be also difference between they hospitality have take on more of the burden of support our town centre over time relative to retail because there be different level of opportunity in commerce there be some with retail business but there tend to be little with hospitality business because by definition if someone take something from vend machine that be not hospitality support the concept of fundamentally reform business rate the world have change with the growth of commerce and thankfully the growth of wage at the low end of the wage distribution we need to make sharp distinction between shop and distribution shed but this bill do not do that the distinction that the bill make in its reform be between large premise with large rateable value and small premise quick read of the wording of the transform business rate document which explain the policy would almost make one think that the change be design to distinguish online business from traditional retail but they be not the document mention property with rateable value or more which capture the majority of large distribution warehouse include those use by online giant that be true but that will also capture lot of other business such as department store and hotel which be clearly part of the retail and hospitality sector conversely some part of the distribution network of online business will not be capture one very large well know online retailer have already move to more distribute hub and speak network with its regional fulfilment approach dare say that those one hour delivery grocery people have even small individual premise in reform business rate hope that the minister will consider that they can not do all the work strongly welcome the previous government introduction of the digital service tax which be always put forward as an interim measure pende wide reform of international taxation through the oecd do not believe broad online sale tax be likely to be helpful definition would become difficult and the development of some of the small business in our town centre that we value could be impede but welcome the government talk about more frequent valuation any reform of business rate must address the cliff edge that the hon member for st albans daisy cooper talk about as well as another problem that we as mp worry great deal about which be vacant premise right now be most concerned about right now the government promise that they would raise the same revenue but in fair way that be not what be about to happen let we be very clear the amount of money to be raise from business rate be about to go up and it be about to go up on the back of retail and hospitality business the government will say the minister have already we be extend relief that be go to come to an end believe it or not lady and gentleman there be even line in the transform business rate document that say the government will save the average pub year they may say that but that be not how it will feel to that pub or to the typical retail leisure or hospitality business in any of our constituency when they discover that the relief on business rate be come down from to for many business in real term that mean doubling or more of the business rate they pay and we can not see that in isolation it come on top of many other pressure the increase in the national living wage be good thing the national living wage have be very successful policy that since have reduce the number of people in work on low pay from one in five to less than one in however be afraid that the further increase in the national living wage which welcome come with thing that do not welcome particularly the great extra cost pressure on employer national insurance contribution lot of nonsense have be talk about whether that count as tax on work people everybody know that in the end employer taxis on labour only ever show through in low employment figure or wage low than they otherwise would have be on top of that there be the french style labour law while high employer national insurance contribution may result in low employment at any individual institution the effect of the business rate hike will be that some establishment will close altogether before sit down want to say word about school topic on which impassioned speech have be make by member across the house most of what colleague have say will probably be discuss again on wednesday when the finance bill have its second reading can assure the minister that we will be back for that debate too relatively speak the measure in this bill be small compare with the vat change this bill be project to eventually raise million for the treasury and another million for local authority compare with billion through the vat hike these measure also have relatively small effect on displacement into state school but let we be clear there be still displacement into state school that be cost to the state but more importantly when it come to individual place it will be strain on some of our local school system on class size and ultimately on parent prospect of get the first choice for their child the school they want to go to although colleague on both side of the house have say that we can not talk about the rate alone but have to put they together with vat there be four thing happen this year that will increase the amount of money go out of independent school into the exchequer business rate be one of they vat be the second the third be the rise in employer national insurance contribution which will have big effect on this sector and the fourth be the five percentage point increase in employer contribution through the teacher pension scheme estimate that for most school that measure on its own account for about of total cost all this matter because of the uneven effect it will have on displacement into state school whether person be in salford or in surrey in bristol or in bury they may find that great and unexpected strain be put on the school in their area this measure as well as the vat measure will also have disproportionate effect on low cost faith school many of which rely partly on donation to keep go those be not business that be in some way well endow they be do something because they believe it serve the need of their faith something that they can not find in the state sector some of those school be charge less than the cost of the average state school place in our country and it seem bizarre that this government wish to hammer they it will also create two tier charity system in which some charity can be disfavour fiscally even while comply with their charitable obligation and serve their community it be new and most unwelcome example of state overreach and will be vote against the bill this evening will base much of my contribution on the latter part of this bill which deal with private school however before go into that welcome the change that the minister be propose through this legislation that will massively benefit our high street the reality be that the past year see our high street devastate by the previous government in particular welcome the permanent lowering of business rate in the retail hospitality and leisure sector which think will be huge boost to our high street on the school part of the debate it would be remiss of not to start by mention the year of brutal tory cut that have lead we to this moment in which state school be hang on by thread they be abandon for year by government who bring zero investment to schooling who simply watch the sector struggle through the pandemic and leave school building laden with asbestos or crumble concrete they know that teacher be pay out of their own pocket for school supply and food for hungry student but instead of support they the previous government choose to attack public worker who be close to breaking point teacher have long pay the price leave the education system in drove and can we blame they give the treatment they have have over the past year in my constituency of bradford east alone of school have face cut to per pupil funding cut of million since that be over less per pupil as such it be refreshing to finally see government share my value and my commitment to not leave state school at break point with clear plan to deliver much need lifeline directly to those school by end private school eligibility for business rate charitable rate relief and vat relief the minister be right to note that vat relief be deal with in separate piece of legislation that be yet to come before this house but both be connect in this debate so will also make mention of the vat relief that private school currently enjoy frankly the billion that will be raise will go towards improve the education and life outcome of all child by fund the recruitment of thousand more teacher and much need breakfast club for child many will welcome the government end the discount on education that the rich school and the rich parent currently get because what kind of government arrange concession for the wealthy while working class child go hungry as they learn despite some of the argument we have hear and will hear that be not society that champion freedom of choice it be one where the wealth bracket of someone parent their postcode and their school determine the success of their life if we let this inequality entrench itself any long we will never be able to end it fully understand and endorse the spirit of the decision to close the tax loophole on private school but also note the grow fear and concern in my constituency and other constituency particularly for the small independent and faith school that as we should also recognise provide excellent and often specialise schooling for child that be why be pleased that the government have confirm that where private school be charity that provide education for child with education health and care plan they will retain the charitable relief as they rightly should my view be that the impact on small independent and faith school should be consider too and firmly believe that it be not in the spirit of this legislation to punish they we should draw clear distinction the hon gentleman be quite right to highlight the impact on small school which often have pretty low fee so be he go to vote against the bill tonight the spirit of this legislation be to hit everything in the private sector as if every institution be eton when he know and we know that they be anything but the right hon gentleman be brave soul because he often try to defend the indefensible he and have often spar between these benches but would say to he that the place he come from and the place come from be distinctly different support the spirit and ethos of this legislation because do not think it be right to give tax concession and subsidy to the rich in society while the poor of our kid go hungry in school so we come from different place if he let make the point about where be come from about genuinely small and faith school think it may at least answer part of his question when we talk about these school let we be clear that the average fee for some of the small school be about which be great deal less than the average they be maintain through community support and donation and they be not in the same league as the etons of this world they do not reproduce class inequality and in fact they enable some of the most deprived community to flourish it would be travesty if these school be inadvertently punish by decision design to tackle the same inequality that some of they work so hard to break down if we do not consider the impact on they the school charge the low fee which be often locate in extremely deprive community will suffer and sadly the child whose working class parent have often save up for many year to get they into these school will have to leave again while of course support child move from that sector into the state sector the reality be that year of underfunding and under investment have leave we with serious capacity issue in the state sector which be something conservative members may want to address when they speak want to take this opportunity to recognise the massive contribution that faith school make to society have number of muslim faith school that do some excellent work in my constituency and want to put on the record my thank to they for all they do must therefore urge minister to put in safeguard for small independent and faith school many of which sadly will not survive the policy in its current form this can be achieve because believe the money that would be generate from the small of these school be not at level that would have an impact on the overall spirit of this legislation madam deputy speaker you be star at in very telling way although there be no time limit know that look to conclude agree wholeheartedly that we can not keep fund tax break for the top end of society while neglect the rest this be something have speak on and champion my whole life and believe this policy be the right one for our state school however must urge the government to reconsider and not let small independent and faith school which be some of the lowest charge school to pay the price must urge ministers to listen to their concern and put in safeguard as this and other relevant bills progress through to their next stage refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests and the fact that own high street café be proud that there be so many independent shop and high street in my constituency of frome and east somerset midsomer norton in particular epitomise the traditional british high street with haberdashery hardware and craft shop on the other side of the constituency people need only take stroll through frome to stumble across independent cafés bookshop and tailor we know that high street be the centre of local economy and place for community cohesion they be idiosyncratic to the need of the community they serve and offer local job and training opportunity they also provide social good for example denude be zero waste shop in frome that help support the local community to live more sustainably yet for the last nine year small business and local high street have feel the burden of economic instability and other pressure the shop and business that still exist have fight hard to protect themselves and they have in many way defy the odd they have have to adapt to change consumer trend compete with the rise of online retail giant navigate and survive the mini budget and the subsequent impact on mortgage rate and disposable income which be still be feel while still feel the impact of all this some business will in the short term have to pay both high business rate and national insurance contribution small business have prove that they be excellent at adapt but really do fear the impact that some of these change may have on our local high street and independent shop business have speak to over the last few month often use the phrase that they be only one bad month away from closure while permanently lower business rate for retail hospitality and leisure be step in the right direction it be still not enough to help our flourish high street thrive again and we know that many important small business fall outside these category the lib dems want to see complete overhaul of the business rate system instead of target small business which be the backbone of our high street and local community we want to replace business rate with new fairer levy on commercial property owner rather than their tenant small business can adapt but not endlessly and fear that at the moment too much be be throw at they with insufficient support at the general election business in my community be cry out for change they feel the need for stability and certainty after more than decade of chaos and incompetence have hit they all hard one of the thing they welcome be labour pledge to reform business rate and ensure that the online giant which suck so much out of our local economy would pay their fair share small town high street such as those in margate broadstairs and ramsgate desperately need the support that change in business rate will give they it be vital that we create fairer business rate regime to support investment and protect our high street more widely hear real anxiety on the doorstep about the need for more teacher in our school and access to quality education so often unavailable for the of child who go to state school reform business rate for private school which serve only of the population make sense it be carefully cost and will make difference to so many child in thanet and across our country hope in particular that this reform be driver to increase access to the creative discipline so that child can learn to expand develop and harness their imagination appreciate the art in all their form with good quality creative education deliver by qualified teacher who love their subject it should go without say but it do need to be say that child raise with good quality creative education have the potential to go on to contribute to our local economy through the creative industry include by start their own business our business rate system have disincentivise investment and create huge burden on our high street the conservative party create cliff edge for high street business across the country as temporary relief be due to end provide certainty through relief rate and the freezing of the small business tax multiplier be very welcome welcome the chancellor intention to permanently low rate for retail hospitality and leisure this be crucial for constituency such as east thanet where creative industry and tourism business be cry out for help have be work with the ramsgate empty shop campaign to revive the town high street despite its wonderful heritage thrive creative community and extraordinary environmental asset ramsgate local economy be far too seasonal and that make run business all year round hard that in turn have drive many business to the brink and leave the high street echo with the silence of empty shop space that should be see as an opportunity for entrepreneur have become sign of desolation that must change the importance of business rate change be also highlight in the other aspect of this bill the removal of private school rate relief every parent want the good for their child that impulse be not exclusive to those who choose to send their child to private school there be nothing wrong with ambition if we be to enable all family to fulfil their ambition we must ensure that they all have access to the very good quality education it be our duty as society and country to ensure that all those child talent aptitude and interest be nurture vast swathe of working class child do not have access to the kind of education that would be genuinely transformative for example the last government cut back radically the amount of art education in state school lock working class child out of the opportunity to find their talent tap into their imagination and learn how to play an instrument express themselves through dance wield paint brush work with clay or look deeply and critically at the world around they and respond to it they pursue curriculum that damage the prospect of those child in contrast private school know that creative education be good for child wellbee and academic outcome that be why they put so many resource into develop it that be why they allocate the resource build the asset and invest in the teaching staff to ensure that their child get that access to the creative art that contribute to society in every dimension unsurprisingly of those work in the film tv and music industry be educate at private school who know the amount of untapped talent in the of child in state school that we have lose as country because of the action of the last government it be estimate that the creative sector in the uk be worth billion and employ million people we be limit ourselves as country by not give every child access to creative education imagine how much more we could be produce in economic prosperity as well as great wellbee if those child have the same access that the have so yes it be right to find that money from the private school who serve the yes it be right that we find the money for more and well teacher in state school with love of the art with an enthusiasm for share their appreciation and skill and with an aptitude for spot talent rewarding effort and encourage creativity those small business in my community also want to know that the child in our school become young adult as fully rounded product of our education system with their imagination skill and discipline develop ready for the kind of work in the creative industry that drive our economy locally nationally and globally if for nothing else urge the house to vote for these change for our child our small business and our economy the liberal democrats would like to see much more fundamental reform of business rate although there be promise of further step it be disappointing that our new government with such large majority be not be more ambitious now our high street will remain in deep trouble the retail hospitality and leisure sector will now have only relief instead of but sector such as manufacturing which be have such difficult time adjust to post brexit world will get zero relief national insurance contribution will be greatly increase with taxis have to be pay before business even make profit on top of that we all know that our high street such as witney beautiful high street as see in the times today be be eat alive by online retail we need to do much more to level the play field between online and offline retail but this adjustment be very very blunt instrument for do so we need to be much more precise about go after big tech and tax it appropriately there be few step that we would like to see commercial landowner levy that tax just the land value of commercial site not productive investment have work very effectively in australia denmark and estonia land value tax be much more effective at capture the publicly create uplift in land value rather than leave it to landowner to pocket they sometimes with enormous gain this be largely how our victorian forebear build our railway network and it be how country around the world range from japan and korea to much of northern europe fund new transport link something that we want to do between oxford and witney scrap stamp duty on commercial land would make our market in land simple and more efficient switch the tax to the owner rather than the tenant would spare small and medium sized enterprise the admin burden of property taxation and would save money and time in collect the tax end the exemption on empty and derelict premise would incentivise action rather than inaction we very much hope that the new government will follow through on their promise to take further substantial step after all they have the vote over the weekend watch my second favourite film at the end the main character or at least the main character in my opinion utter the immortal line that the need of the many outweigh the need of the few when consider the ending of tax exemption and charitable status for private school often consider that line we want all child to have the good chance in life to succeed and of child in the uk attend state school like every child they deserve the high quality of support and teaching also believe that end the tax break on private school will help to raise the revenue need to fund our education priority for the next year but then realise that the phrase the need of the many do not quite cover it the conservative party talk about choice but there be really only two reason why parent would choose to pay ten of thousand of pound each year to send their child to private school rather than state school maybe three if they go to eton those reason be long open time and boarding facility and lack of faith in local state provision we want to take away the choice to go to private school but not in the way that the conservative party keep parrot we want to make state school so good that no one feel the need to send their child to private school there should be no necessity for private school think all member in the chamber even on the opposition benches will acknowledge the issue with send funding in school it have be underfunde be lucky enough to visit newhall primary school in my constituency on friday see the work it be do to support its send student even though it be not specialist send school however it could only do that with small number of student imagine what it could do with additional funding opportunity it could help so many more what many people fail to recognise be that these private school have the choice to absorb some of the tax we be not here to punish student or parent school can choose to absorb some of the tax in the same way that the state sector have be ask to do for the past year wonder whether the hon gentleman listen to the speech of the hon member for bradford east imran hussain many private school actually charge less than the funding that go to state school every school be not eton what do the hon gentleman have to say about the most vulnerable school and the child therein should the proper design of any policy not be ground in look at the most vulnerable rather than the strong it be very exciting to take my first intervention from an opposition member but think the right hon gentleman fail to recognise the point that be try to make be say that we need to support the state sector to be as good as it possibly can so that parent do not feel the need to send their child to private school the conservatives groan when we mention the billion black hole but do not even need to mention the billion black hole in fact will not mention the billion black hole what will say however be that we have high street that be already board up and school building leave crumble visit state school in my constituency all the time and see child of all age and ability full of compassion intelligence and potential have the fantastic opportunity to visit st mark catholic school in my constituency again last friday the student ask fantastic question if they be listen now emphasise that they can aspire to achieve everything they want in life however classroom be overfill and underfunde paint be peel off the wall and some school not that particular school have faulty heating despite all those thing the pupil could not be fill with more excitement or more desire to learn and understand can see that you be look at madam deputy speaker so have well get on labour be make the fair choice to support small business to give every child the chance to succeed and to protect the public finance will finish with line from my favourite film of all time matter of life and death at the beginning david niven say politic conservative by nature labour by experience be delighted that on july plenty of people go to the poll with that view curiously the hon member do not explain the movie he refer to in open his speech the carrdus school in my constituency be small private school it be not an eton and it be not harrow but it have already announce that it may be force to close mid academic year because of the budget and this bill meet the headteacher the other day she be passionate leader who be absolutely devastate by this she mention many of the point that my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds make about the four main area she explain that of the school cost be on staff salary so the increase in employer national insurance contribution be crippling the change to business property relief be challenge and impose vat on school fee mean that the uplift in fee be unsustainable for many parent they simply can not absorb this tax after these consistent hit the school face little choice but potentially to close that mean that child include child with ehcp will now have to plan to be rehome into different school with all the disruption that that cause the burden also fall on our local council which now have the responsibility to find different state place somewhere that will take those child with ehcp this be happen when council budget be already stretch our state school be at capacity and this will lead to more harm for many child the hon member for east thanet ms billington mention the importance of creative opportunity entirely agree that the art be vital but the budget also hit opportunity for access to the creative art the northamptonshire music and performing arts trust be charitable organisation that offer child of all background access to lesson but the increase in employer national insurance and the business property relief make it so much hard to offer those lesson nmpat be genuinely struggle it would be devastating to lose such opportunity for our next generation regardless of politic we must remember that it be our child education that be be penalise by these measure want to speak specifically about the removal of charitable tax status from private school we know that the total proportion of schoolchildren who be in private school be that mean that of child be not do that still matter of course those child matter believe that every child should have access to high quality education say that have spend year work on the frontline in state education under the previous labour government where the framework for all child service be every child matter forgive if feel little angry about some of the chuntering that be go on because work in frontline education when the coalition government come in the conservatives and liberal democrats be work together and in the first month what do they cut they cut the education maintenance allowance which support some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged child be work with to go to sixth form the disadvantaged subsidy pathfinder project cut the national careers service cut school sport partnership cut youth service cut sure start service cut sure start maternity grant cut that be all within the first month that cause the rot to set in within our education system and it be the very reason why be stand here today at the school gate in the morning this be bit of reality when drop off my son stand side by side with parent juggle job and home life who have ambition for their child that know no boundary every parent have ever work with want well for their child whether someone be financially able to send their child to private school do not change that yet there be huge disparity in choice state school be struggle department for education figure release in january this year show that last year of local authority maintain school be in deficit that be high than in and there be report that of those school be in nottinghamshire in my constituency of sherwood forest the stop school cuts campaign estimate that of school have face cut to pupil funding since that be have huge impact on the life of child in my constituency and on their health wellbee and mental health one area of my constituency have the high rate of male suicide in the whole country regularly meet school in my constituency see how hard the staff work to ensure that child still get quality education despite the challenge that they face one of the main challenge be fund want to illustrate what that mean in day to day life leen mills primary school be fantastic school serve its community and some of the most disadvantaged child live in my community it be unable to afford acceptable building and classroom for its child to learn in one that facilitate learn and be comfortable for pupil and staff pupil have to walk outside between building temporary building to use the toilet in all weather come rain or shine that should not be the case yet it be so hard for the school to meet the most basic requirement without have to put up fight the change to private school charitable tax status will generate additional funding so that we can improve our public service for all child and young people with more funding for school such as leen mills primary school all pupil no matter where they live or how much their parent have would have the right to access safe and comfortable learning environment the change be also about make sure that we have enough teacher in particular one who know and understand sen provision we know have see it that if we well invest in our public mainstream school that will drastically impact pupil with sen and those from the most disadvantaged background it should not ever be that parent only option be an independent private school that be an indictment of the previous government the rot set in with the coalition government whose fail education system continue to fail child the truth be that education in the state sector have be neglect how do know see it as parent today there be difference between pupil who have access to free school meal an indicator of poverty and those who do not at gcse that be not an education system achieve as it should see this every day as parent as governor and as professional when we get it right education change live and transform whole community this government will once again transform education so that every child include every child in my constituency matter because education should be right not privilege since become member of parliament early this year have be hearten every time have hear ministers confirm that business rate reform be plan know what impact business rate can have on town centre through my work as council leader and my time own and operate high street business for nearly year in my constituency of mid dorset and north poole do not any more so do not need to declare that as an interest but that be why be so disappointed to read the bill which simply tinker around the edge and do nothing to fix the foundation of our town centre or about the inequity of business rate between physical and online business welcome the high rate aim at large warehouse but it do not go far enough those online business have suck the life out of our high street and if what the bill propose be the extent of the change it will not support anyone it be not just favourable business rate that benefit online business they can use tax loophole to avoid pay the taxis that small business pay as proportion of their profit do the hon member agree that the government have other mechanism for raise such funding agree with the hon member and thank he for his intervention be just about to say that we need proper tech tax on online business which should be ringfence to stay in local community where council could use it to support town centre in way that work for they many council be not able to keep the business rate accrue in their area they be set externally and send elsewhere to support other community that be not understand or even appreciate by local community can not remember the number of time that as local government leader be shout at by people say you make all that money as council people think that the council own the business and the property and that they set the rate the fact be they be set elsewhere and council do not have the power to provide discount without have to plug the gap not just for their own area but for what they send to government that be what real reform would look like the hon member be make some wide range point think the government policy in this area be excellent remind she that there be range of other policy that local government can implement commend my own local council in reading where there have be lot of work to try to keep local small business active in the town centre through planning and range of other thing it be really important to work with the business community would she like to comment on that absolutely we be look to work with the rental auction that be come in when be the lib dem spokesperson in westminster hall debate few week ago be encourage to hear that they be come through hope that that happen quickly and that they do not have the loophole that fear they would have will move on to my concern about this policy we need to ensure that those who profit from business pay business rate as describe in the bill be not just related to the rateable value but be explicitly link to the rental value they bear no relationship to the type of business its profitability or its broad benefit to the community or to society would like to give an example which know be accurate because the figure come from the business that use to own it predate the retail hospitality and leisure discount but that it be not guarantee to be continue anyway think the number will startle you we own café on high street in an affluent community with an old population with competition from several source include costa franchise and church café which of course pay no rate the rent on our café be year our rate bill be that mean that be not eligible for penny of small business rate relief so my rent and rate bill be around month in ward less than three mile away café on that high street be be market with rental of just and rateable value of thank to small business rate relief be sure you will say that be great thing and it be it pay no rate so its fix outgoing be be sure that you madam deputy speaker do not think that we could charge time more for tuna mayo sandwich and cup of coffee than the café down the road that be the problem with the way that business rate work this inequity and the pressure it put on my business and all those represent when chair the broadstone chamber of trade and commerce be what get into politic as sad as that is that be why get involve and why stand here today to say to you that the lib dems want you to go far we want business rate replace with proper landowner levy so that it be not the tenant who pay but those who really benefit from the property the people who own it the bill may be reasonable start but it do not go far enough would love to see you go far order before call the next speaker say to the hon lady that know she will not have intend to do so but she say you repeatedly and it be very unclear whether she be address suspect that the last time it be to the minister charitable tax relief be mean to be for organisation that do something for the good of society they get tax break because they be suppose to benefit the public especially those who need it most but when we look at private school we start to see problem these school be not serve the wide public they charge eye watering fee and the vast majority of people simply can not afford to send their kid there here be the real issue private school be benefit from process that should be support the whole of society they get tax break worth million of pound every year and what do we get in return an education system that reinforce and uphold structural inequality meanwhile state school the one that serve the vast majority of kid be leave to scrape by struggle with overcrowded classroom outdated resource and ever decrease funding the bill be redistributive and it mean that the money go into private school will be far well spend improve the chance of all child want fairness as do my constituent and an equal chance for all our child those on the opposition benches say private school give scholarship do charity work and help kid in need but let we be honest that be drop in the ocean here be the kicker private school be not even charity in the true sense of the word they might not make profit but many of they be run by private company that make money off investment and land we all know that the large private school in the country have no shortage of cash yet they still get subsidy that could be use to fix the mess leave by the previous government in our state school they do not provide benefit for the public good they just prop up inequality and drain resource from the school that serve the vast majority of child welcome the fact that we be take good hard look at the way education work and we be put our money where it do the most good raise aspiration and opportunity for all our child no matter their background that have to be our focus the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake who speak for the official opposition he be no long in his place describe the conservative government approach to support business be go to say that listen to he with interest but think incredulity would be well word my hon friend the member for witney charlie maynard who be no long in his place be rather harsh on the conservatives he say that they never follow up on their commitment on business and do not have clear policy on business the conservatives have very clear and pithily describe policy on business it begin with have in the middle and end with the word business and believe they deliver on that policy with their post brexit trade deal in case the message have not be ram home hard enough they confirm it with budget that play helter skelter chaos with the economy therefore sympathise with the new government approach in term of the budget they be try to set and in term of establish stability that be something would want to support but be disappointed that will not be able to vote for the bill because of the effect it will have on town like wellington and taunton which will be hit by triple whammy those town support some great independent school which be charity taunton school wellington school king college and queen college they sustain around job in the constituency many of which be now under threat many worker at those school cleaner and catering staff be worried about what be go to happen there be then the very serious effect of the rise in national insurance contribution on small business particularly the many small business whose rateable value be over that be quite typical for sme in high street in this country at the small end would suggest the owner of mr miles tea room superb place to go in my constituency have write to tell about the combined effect of the budget on his business firstly all my staff will now see reduction in the hour they will be schedule as result no doubt some will leave where many of my employee already earn over the current minimum wage will not be able to increase their pay rate by as much as have do in the past secondly any full time employee who leave our employment will only be replace by potentially or part time employee thirdly will not be invest in any capital equipment in my kitchen or new decor in my restaurant fourthly there be serious potential for to operate on shorten trading hour thus reduce the vibrancy of the town centre he go on be cautiously optimistic that new labour government could possibly be bad than the previous tory one in term of lack of support for sme sadly in the space of short month this government have already prove my optimism be misplace and there will be many casualty over the next month as the new measure take effect urge the minister to reconsider both the effect on independent school and be great supporter of the state school system there be an independent school in my constituency kingswood house school which have around of its pupil with special educational need many of those pupil do not have an education health and care plan do my hon friend agree that school provide support to so many sen child should retain their charitable rate relief absolutely do agree with my hon friend be also concerned about the influx of child go to local authority to apply for ehcp because they will now need they to get the discount and about the massive effect that will have on already overstretch local authority worry about how they be go to cope with those application over and above the sen crisis at the moment be great supporter of state school partly because of the record of the liberal democrats who not only ringfence the education budget in the first year of the coalition but inject billion by invent the pupil premium which now inject the hon member for sherwood forest michelle welsh shake her head but these be the fact the pupil premium funding be actually disadvantage subsidy pathfinder funding introduce by the previous labour government the hon gentleman party just change the name the pupil premium be new money and it go into the state school sector it be billion in the first year and it be worth billion now it be in the liberal democrat manifesto and be deliver as part of our priority for state school but do not believe in state school just because of party policy all four of my child attend great state school in my constituency parkfield primary school bishop fox school and the fantastic richard huish college the idea that the only way to improve state school be to level down independent school show shocking lack of imagination and very disappointing approach to education and education should not be tax the minister say early that those of we who be go for different approach should be willing to make clear where we would raise the money and he be right to make that point the liberal democrats have make the same point and they have make tough decision in the past in our manifesto be very clear budget spending plan to restore the tax on the big bank profit it be slash and then take away in but simply restore that single tax would raise billion for the economy urge the minister to adopt the principle that if the broad shoulder should bear the big burden that should apply in the business sector as much as anywhere else the big company the big bank the giant online retailer should be bear the burden of this budget not the small high street firm like mr miles in taunton high street and the other business we have hear about so urge the minister to think far about this national non domestic rating multiplier be there any more interesting topic for nearly on monday night interruption quite right absolutely not be sure that the regular reader of my blog would say much the same our system of taxation and local government be the product of evolution and not of design it have its root in elizabethan form of taxation that have be inherit and alter during the passage of time to adapt to modern reality and what we be talk about today be yet again adapt to those modern reality like many other member be former local government leader and might well have be one of those who be bend the ear of the exchequer secretary to the treasury my hon friend the member for ealing north james murray in ask for this change because it be well overdue we have hear town centre describe as the heart of the community what do we actually mean by that without clear public space where the whole of society interact town lack identity and common sense of bond between they they tend to fall apart and we see social degradation council leader such as have spend the last year try to adapt to the new reality of our economy spend fortune in public money and invest countless hour include countless officer hour in try to reinvigorate our town centre to ensure that they live on for the next generation not simply because that be what we think well but because overwhelmingly it be the response that people say they want for their area they want their town centre to be vibrant again and to be fundamental part of their community the problem be that no matter what we do on the ground no matter how much effort we put in we simply can not overcome the huge cost disparity between online retailing and physical retailing in the high street one would expect that where these challenge exist the state would use the lever at its disposal to encourage an extra boost for what we consider to be socially beneficial as oppose to what we consider to be detrimental to society the proposal under discussion do exactly that they ensure that the part of our community that our constituent want which be fundamental to their identity survive into the come decade while also ensure that those that no long have the profit margin they once have surprise surprise in elizabethan time the most profitable business be building next to the local church be give comparable break we have hear great deal from opposition members about what party in government over the last year could would or should have do give the opportunity but be sorry to say that they do not do any of it as council leader during that period be regularly make the case for change we be promise change at various time but they never happen the one thing that we do end up with be full business rate retention my local authority collect million worth of business rate each year and we get to keep million which put pay to the idea that word have any real meaning when they be use in connection with some of these policy this be the single big change that can be introduce to ensure that our high street survive in the future be very proud that regardless of whatever idealised form the opposition may wish to imagine could exist the policy be deliver in the bill enable we to support the business that our community desperately want and will ensure that business that can afford to carry big load do so rise in support of the majority of the amendment table by the liberal democrats reduce the high street business rate relief from to will devastate the small business on my high street in batley and dewsbury and many of they will not be able to absorb the cost result in job loss and closure my primary topic however will be the implication of the bill for private school that do not draw their student from the rich family in our society when speak out against the introduction of vat in previous debate be accuse of not want the good for of student in our country absolutely love state school and visit boothroyd primary academy during uk parliamentary week last week the child be so excited to meet but think be more excited to meet they and their teacher also visit private faith school that charge believe less than per pupil and speak to the pupil there there be private school that serve poor working class family and there be reason why these family have choose to send their child to such school parent would be penalise if we remove that choice the other challenge that have in my constituency be that school be burst at the seam with very few if any place available to parent many child be go to their second or third choice school away from their catchment area let come back to the removal of private school charitable status which be an extra burden on top of charge vat at student at such school overwhelmingly come from low income family and this reality often get lose in the debate about private school we be all very aware of their elitist nature with average fee of over rise to they service only the child of the wealthy it be not the child of the wealthy however who attend independent school in constituency such as dewsbury and batley where faith school be often the only option for family who can not get their child into local state school due to demand or where state school can not meet their religious and spiritual need those family be overwhelmingly from low income background and the removal of business rate charitable rate relief from private school will result in further increase in their fee in addition to the propose vat for wealthy family that might not be problem for the family in my constituency it be major problem in addition the measure will pose risk to the future viability of many private school which often charge just enough to exist ask the government to consider that class be reality in the discussion about private school but not in the way it be commonly present in many community faith base school be not the preserve of the wealthy they overwhelmingly educate the child of ordinary working class family the government impact assessment of the proposal show that the average cost per school of the removal of charitable status range from to year for faith school this issue be more complicated than measure to raise tax and it feel to that some important subtlety have be lose in the debate for many of my constituent faith school not only provide high quality education they also provide child of faith with the relative freedom to express their faith and identity without fear of stigma or recrimination feel that none of this reality be properly consider when we discuss vat on private school and now through abolish business rate charitable rate relief for private school that imbalance continue the government have an opportunity now to redress that imbalance and request that consideration be give to extend the exclusion for special need school to include faith base school that draw their student from low income background one easy solution would be to exempt from vat school that charge below per pupil state school allowance and allow they to retain their charitable status last week visit jacqueline franchise owner who through sheer hard work and work her way up through the rank now run number of restaurant outlet in and around mansfield witness at first hand her dedication to her business through the manner in which she motivate her staff as business leader for leisure and hospitality business such as jacqueline trading be tough and have be make hard by the circumstance they be trade in namely the uncertainty surround business rate under the previous government locally stand on platform to focus on five specific issue across mansfield and warsop one of which be to help improve our town centre many in my local town centre be represent by the mansfield business improvement district and when meet up with they as often do sometimes together with representative of the shopkeepers campaign business rate come up time and again it be clear that we need fair system that do not put an unreasonable burden on the small business that power our high street and that be why welcome the reform to business rate that be be make through the bill the bill will bring certainty and fairness to the retail hospitality and leisure business that have be disproportionately disadvantage by the current system be far pleased to see that the bill create the power need to ensure that we can make good on our promise to introduce permanently low rate for those retail hospitality and leisure property that make up the backbone of our high street include in my constituency of mansfield and to pay for this with high multipli for the most valuable property as well as speak with local business every week also visit school across my constituency last week visit primary school that have not turn on the heating in the main part of its building for over month and be reliant on the benevolence of local business to provide an essential breakfast club it simply should not have to be that way with school rely on local business and be sure that it will not be that way under this labour government in my mansfield constituency more than one in four pupil be eligible for and claim free school meal and the school they be teach in be cry out for additional resource to help those young people we can not afford to offer tax break to private school operate as business when our child state education system which be rely on by over of the child in my constituency be crumble that be why will be vote to support this bill which will end those tax break on private school and help to raise the revenue need to fund this government education priority this bill have several issue but its glaring failure be the lack of immediate support for the many small and medium sized business outside the retail hospitality and leisure sector that be important to our national economy and our local high street the government claim that they would like to have level playing field between the high street and the online giant but this bill fail to properly address the issue many small business fall outside the retail hospitality and leisure sector and will therefore see no benefit from the bill these small business need their tax burden to be reduce too labour plan to increase national insurance contribution and business rate will prove too much for many small business include charity in my constituency that tell their increase national insurance contribution will seriously affect they and reduce the amount of money they can spend on support the resident of wokingham small business in my constituency have see huge increase in both rent and cost and they have to do their good to survive under conservative government who trash the economy as result of conservative policy over the last few year household with mortgage now have at least year less to spend on our local high street where our friend and neighbour work what these small business need now be proper overhaul and reform of the business rate system not bill that meddle around the edge to provide ineffective and short term solution and they do not need an increase in employer national insurance contribution my constituency have approximately business outside the retail hospitality and leisure industry which be roughly of the business in wokingham this make up be not too dissimilar from the national picture so the bill will be ineffective for business across the uk the bill fail to offer support to the vast majority of business that desperately need their tax burden to be reduce it be clear that this bill do not do enough and so many business and charity that be so important to our high street will be leave to absorb all the extra taxation levy on they by the government this bill will not fix the break business rate system and it will seriously damage the retail and small business sector in our economy be pleased to speak on this bill which introduce the power require to reform business rate the government be commit to fair business rate system that protect the high street and support investment and welcome the fact that in the budget the chancellor set out her intention to permanently low rate for the retail hospitality and leisure property that make up the backbone of our high street include queen street in morley of course this will be pay for by high multipli for the most valuable property however want to focus on another aspect of the bill be teacher so will talk about the provision that remove the charitable relief on business rate for many but not all private school this run alongside our general election commitment to introduce vat on private school fee which we will be discuss on second reading of the finance bill on wednesday both measure will of course increase funding for state school during the general election campaign in july and in the year lead up to it speak to many parent in my constituency about the removal of tax break for private school whatever their stance be on the policy it be clear to that every single parent speak to want the good for their child it do not matter whether they consider themselves wealthy or not whether they earn enough to send their child to private school or not or whether they live in new farnley or thorpe every single one of they want the good education for their child like suspect almost every member of this house want an amazing education for every child irrespective of where they come from or who they be that be exactly what government member be commit to deliver use the revenue that this bill and the finance bill on wednesday will raise we live in country where of all child attend state school fully accept that the parent of the of child who go to private school have work very hard to put they there but you know who else work hard madam deputy speaker the parent of kid who go to state school they work just as hard in their job and profession yet some may never be in the financial position to send their child to private school those child deserve the good too so it fall on the government to take the decision necessary to improve our state school state school be plague by so many crisis under the previous government see the send crisis the concrete crisis and the recruitment and retention crisis myself in my previous job as head of math at an inner city school if put out job advert would be lucky if get one applicant per position and that be not just because of that must change and we must raise the money to change it take together with our commitment to introduce vat on private school fee which accept we be not debate today the extra net revenue raise from this policy will be essential to recruit the new teacher we promise the electorate we would recruit in the general election every child deserve to be teach by qualified teacher in every single subject alongside our commitment to roll out free breakfast club invest in send provision rebuild the school estate and increase per pupil funding in real term we be choose to back our child back our school and back our country give the crisis in send welcome that those in private school mainly concern with the provision of the education of child with ehcp will retain their charitable business rate relief by remove the tax break enjoy by most private school however we can invest in our state school will be able to say to the parent speak to in leeds south west and morley that we be give their child the education they deserve will be able to say that we take decisive action to break down barrier to opportunity for all and by vote for today bill and the measure in the finance bill will be able to say to they that we find the funding to fund our state school properly know that opposition member be oppose to these change however the leader of the opposition have also state that she do not object to the positive part of the budget include our investment in education so my question to opposition members would be how be you go to pay for it what exactly be your plan we know what you oppose but what do you support think that the conservatives have make something like million of uncosted commitment every single hour since they elect their new leader it be hard not to conclude that we be deal with the same old conservative party it be no long serious party of government however labour be education be central to our mission of expand opportunity enrich our society and empower our student to be the well possible version of themselves whether they live in churwell gildersome east ardsley or lofthouse do not matter this labour government be get on with our mandate of deliver change and ensure that all our child have the opportunity to fulfil their true potential grow up help my mum on the shop floor of small gift shop and my memory of the wonderful work that she do to build that business and the staff she employ be real benefit to my life also see how hard she work and how hard thing get she go down from four shop to one then come across the classic problem of whether she be able to keep her shop open and battle with online retailer the cost go up business rate be too much and she decide to close and go online frankly be tired of we not take support for small business seriously and make change this government have an opportunity to make difference but they have squander opportunity when it come to business rate reform see the impact on business in my high street have the privilege of represent several magnificent high street in tring berkhamsted harpenden wheathampstead and redbourn but business there be struggle yet again michelle from graze life tell time and again about the impact the cost of business rate have on her business eventually she close her high street shop down speak to peter from the oakman group booming business that start in tring in the company be rise star and have receive prize for be one of the good place to work for employee but peter now say it be on the edge of extinction he employ people but he say the budget include business rate change will have an impact of up to million on his business so he will look to close many of his premise my hon friend mention several business in her constituency that will be impact by the change speak recently to small restaurant owner in my constituency they have six restaurant across the south of england and they say that the business rate change plus other budget measure will cost their business just to do what they be do today do she agree with that that will not encourage such business to invest in the uk open new restaurant and help grow the economy which we all want absolutely that be the message be hear again and again another business owner in tring say that they would love to open on the high street but they just can not afford it the broken business rate system be affect our business the people who work there and our community which be lose out on fantastic local business the minister talk about build confidence to invest but business rate directly tax capital investment rather than tax profit or fix stock of land that need to change reiterate the liberal democrats call for absolute reform of business rate and the introduction of commercial landowner levy that will tax the land value of commercial site not productive investment and boost that productive investment support our local business and help community and local employer many family have write to about the change to charitable rate relief for private school support the call from the government benches to improve all state school but parent decide to send their child to private school for many reason include special educational need support their child specialist skill or because of bullying we have choice about how we raise that money instead of tax the bank be it fair to be tax the education of other child to raise that money just few week ago my right hon friend the leader of the opposition highlight billion black hole in the local government budget arise from the recent budget some billion of extra spending be announce with only billion of funding to pay for it and in this bill we begin to see how this government propose to fill that gap first they come for the pensioner then they come for the farmer then they come for the student then they come for the employer and now they be come for our high street our pub and our shop with another whammy of tax rise let we not pretend that this be an essential step the choice that be make by the chancellor and this government in their budget be drive up inflation and borrowing cost with the government borrow record amount last month they be drive up employment cost and council will be hit just as they be hit the rest of our economy reflect that the minister for local government and english devolution the hon member for oldham west chadderton and royton jim mcmahon say in pub be the beat heart or the anchor of many community and the place where people can get together to tackle loneliness and isolation official report december vol indeed those be sentiment that many labour members have express in this chamber and in westminster hall recently but all those member who come here to express their support and champion their local pub be about to vote for bill that on average will put up its taxis by more than year all this from government who promise to replace business rate indeed rachel from account be sorry madam deputy speaker mean rachel from complaint admin go so far as to promise in to abolish they we all know from personal experience whether in our own family or in our former life in local government the value of the diversity of our education system we know about the increase in attainment bring about by the huge growth in the number of independent school in the form of academy start under the last labour government and develop under the previous government but we continue to see this spiteful class war attack on school and this bill continue labour war on education several liberal democrat members have mention britain former membership of the european union and of course this measure to become the only country in europe to tax education would be illegal under eu law the bill still do not fully consider the need of our special need school many have mix of fully private and ehcp fund pupil and the balance will change over time an example be the gesher school in my constituency which provide for significant number of child on the autistic spectrum one year nearly may be privately fund and the next year the vast majority will be ehcp fund the bill simply do not usefully answer the question of how such setting will pay their taxis several member around the chamber include on the labour benches have set out their serious concern about the impact on small faith school the government face ongoing legal challenge on the subject which be incredibly important if our country be to have the diverse base of education that many muslim community in particular have struggle to find in the establish mainstream state sector labour members have pour scorn on our education system but remind they of the transformation in state education standard over the past year have be local authority lead member for education for that whole time would be the last person to claim that everything in the state sector be perfect however we see amazing progress on close the disadvantage attainment gap in england under the previous government in the context of our progress in international league table when we leave office class size be stable at which be less than the statutory limit that the previous labour government introduce as in any democracy we must ask whether the harm that the policy do to some family and to some child education be outweigh by its benefit we should reflect that if every single penny raise by these policy find its way to state school budget although we already know that that will not happen because they will also be fund the big increase in ofsted bureaucracy that the secretary of state set out for we few short week ago it will cover less than half the cost of single teacher in each of those state school at time when pupil roll in england be fall it be quite clear that the motivation for this policy be spite and class war and that it have nothing whatever to do with standard in our school if that be not enough my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake have set out the very serious concern about this plan that we hear from across business and particularly from the retail sector and license trade from the association of convenience stores which represent the small corner shop that enable our resident to access the good they need at all hour of night and day to the very big retailer such as sainsbury which have set out in detail the damage that this budget and this bill be already do to worker pay and to the prospect for investment for pay growth and for training and employment growth in this country in reflect on what we can be proud of from the past year draw the house particular attention to the fact that when the conservatives leave office there be million more people in work in this country than when we take office youth unemployment be half what it be when we take office and the proportion of people in this country earn their own living have grow exponentially my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds and my hon friend the member for south northamptonshire sarah bool have set out very clearly the importance of get it right for our community we need to ask whether what be propose today will generate the transformation under the last conservative government year in office we see increase in school funding with per pupil growth alone over the past few year above inflation it be clear that we have decent and honourable record on investment in education our retail sector be the large part of our private sector employment with nearly million worker it be clear that business in that sector from the large to the small be look at the impact that the bill will have on their bottom line and be translate that into low job low growth and less investment they be warn this government very clearly as opposition members do invite the minister to intervene will he tell whether he be willing to promise that small business rate relief will be maintain so far the government have refuse to answer that question cause huge degree of concern among small business of all kind up and down our high street as the government move to introduce high multiplier on business rate we have to ask whether that signify that they will also move as the labour government in wales have do already to introduce additional high council tax band for our residential property it be very clear that as well as come for the pensioner come for the student come for the farmer and come for the employer the government be come for every council tax payer and business rate payer in this country that be not to fill black hole because as we know the black hole do not member read the obr report order thank you very much madam deputy speaker will take the hint be sure that government members have read the view of the office for budget responsibility as avidly as opposition members politic we know be about choice we be proud of the choice that we make which have enhance quality of life wage and the economy in our country we be deeply concerned about the impact that the bill and the wide budget of which it be part will have on our national economy and the prospect of our people we be concerned about the damage that it will do to the life chance of our child we be concerned that it continue to leave black hole in our local government finance for those reason we recognise that this be not really budget it be bodge it that be why we will vote for our reason amendment tonight thank all hon member who have contribute to this enthusiastic and impassioned debate whether they be speak from the government or the opposition benches their speech be genuinely root in the community that people live in and that we represent in way it have bring out the good of parliament but we could not quite avoid the party politic and the rewriting of history from the conservative party shall we really take lesson on save the high street from the conservatives who oversee mass bank closure and the decimation of retail on the high street with pub close in local community they be now the farmer friend but when they be in government they oversee the closure of agricultural business where be they when the energy market and labour supply challenge be decimate farmer they be nowhere to be see now though they come rid on the would the shadow minister like to intervene come in please because he be here for it as be the minister will recall the last government massive intervention in the energy market to keep our light on in this country will he tell the house whether the government will keep the small business rate relief will he answer that question can answer this question it be the impact that matter whatever opposition members say as the farmer friend the truth be different business close on their watch that be what the evidence say let move on to the reason amendment this government be fully commit to protect and support our valuable high street the fact be that retail hospitality and leisure rate relief be due to end in its entirety by the end of march which would have mean cliff edge for business at the budget we step in to prevent that by extend the relief far this year by with cash cap of we have also freeze the small business rate multiplier for take together with the small business rate relief scheme that mean that more than million property will be protect from any inflationary increase next year that be million property protect by this government by the minister logic be we to assume that support on business rate for hospitality and retail be to end in april that really be not worth give way for have literally just say that million property will be support against inflationary increase next year the will continue with cap of that be exactly what this bill be intend to do if the hon gentleman support it he can join the government in the aye lobby and vote for it we know from business that the current scheme of discretionary relief do not provide the certainty need that be why the bill will enable permanent tax cut for retail hospitality and leisure business from through new low multiplier end the year by year uncertainty that the previous government hardwire into the system that be do what business have be call for that rebalancing from out of town to in town from online to on street be exactly what people have call for in community and in business and opposition members know it their frustration be that they do not do it in the year that they have in office it be down to we to take the step that be need in government now and we be happy to do so the reason amendment raise concern about the impact on school in the state sector can assure the house that protect and improve state education be at the forefront of the government mind in fact we estimate that only more pupil will enter the state sector as result of the removal of the business rate relief for private school let we be clear about what that mean in reality that go down to about year in any give year across england pupil will move between school this be we need to keep that in context because we have hear lot of scaremongere about the transfer but that be what the evidence say that evidence be place in the house of commons library in case member want to take time after this debate to go and look there might even be enough time to find the document before the vote if they want to bring themselves up to speed importantly this be about provide much need investment in the state school sector just how many parent say we need specialist support for send because the mainstream provision be not adequate how many parent by their own admission among opposition members choose to pay for private education because they do not have faith in mainstream provision despite what opposition member have say about the glory year of the past year the truth that parent and pupil on the ground feel be very different and they know it we have to repair mainstream provision so that parent and pupil can go with confidence to their local school know that they will get the support that they need support for all pupil not just some several hon member have mention the impact on faith school want to offer some comfort of course we value and understand parental choice but base on the evidence submit through the hmt consultation as well as the analysis undertake by the department for education on remove the charitable rate relief it be not apparent that private faith school will be affect by this measure any more than non faith school there be no evidence of disadvantage will the minister give way want to make progress in the time that have and to wind up within the minute the key point be that all child of compulsory school age be entitle to state fund school place if they need one and all school and they know this be require to follow the requirement of the equality act relate to british value and to promote an environment that encourage respect and tolerance towards family of all faith and none number of member have rightly mention send provision it have be significant part of the debate for understandable reason we have ensure on the face of the bill that private school that be charity and wholly or mainly provide education for pupil with education health and care plan remain eligible for business rate charitable rate relief furthermore private school that benefit from exist rate exemption for property that be wholly use for the training or welfare of disabled people will continue to do so take together we believe those policy mean that most private special educational need school will not be affect by these measure at all we recognise that some pupil with special educational need and disability will be in private school but without local authority funding in place as it be judge that their child need can be provide for within the state sector of course parent will still be free to choose whether to be in the state sector or to remain in the private sector that be very important point to make local authority aim to process all education health and care plan application in time for the start of the next school year but in special case the local authority be able to prepay one term fee if the process be not complete likewise some private school will forgo the first term fee for pupil who be expect to receive their education health and care plan in the future turn to high street the government be wholly commit to rejuvenate our high street we want to support the business and community that make our town centre successful that be why through this bill the government intend to introduce permanently low rate for retail hospitality and leisure from in order to protect the high street that tax cut will be fully fund and sustain through high tax on the most expensive property the of property that have rateable value of or more the new tax rate will be set out in next year budget to factor in the business rate revaluation outcome and the broad economic and fiscal context at that time we be clear in our manifesto that we would look at the business rate system and support our high street and we mean it we know that our high street and town centre be the beat heart of our community but over the past year they have struggle to keep their head above water think about all those household name that have go to the wall that be thing of the past not the future think about all the bank and pub that have close and about the shutter that have come down on shop premise that be once the lifeblood of where people live the previous government have year to get this right but they oversee the decline and decimation of our high street people feel that in their heart because town centre be more than just place to do business they be place for community to come together that be something the tories never understand when they be in government but it

thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to raise very important issue that reflect not just housing crisis but crisis of fairness compassion and accountability involve the relocation of homeless family outside london at first glance it may seem unusual for someone like member of parliament for county durham some mile away from london to seek this debate but the unlawful action of some london borough council have transform homelessness in london into national crisis that have reach directly into my constituency in recent month have be make aware of multiple case of vulnerable family be pressure into relocate to my constituency by london borough council such as those in redbridge hillingdon and enfield the family be be force to choose between homelessness in london and move hundred of mile away isolate from their community and support network recent case involve young mother be threaten and coerce by hillingdon borough council to move to county durham in an email to her housing officer she write now be scared feel anxious and completely push into corner that if do take this accommodation will be discharge from your book and make homeless do understand why you be do this to and my son all want be your help in find place as you have put in temporary accommodation in slough and then you ring today offer place in county durham mile away from anyone and everything know you say have to give you decision tomorrow or must get out of the place be in be discharge from the council book sleep on friend sofa and look after myself how be this fair like say be scared commend the hon gentleman for initiate the debate this be happen not only in london borough but in my constituency the current system mean uproot child from their school and place they in temporary home that be too far away to make it work in my constituency child be school in the ards peninsula be move to enniskillen nearly three hour away away from family friend and school it really do not stack up do the hon gentleman agree that the educational need of child must be take into account indeed they must be paramount thank the hon gentleman for his intervention the whole purpose of this debate be to draw attention to the fact that the action of some not all local authority be illegal and should be subject to some sanction hope we will hear bit more about that from the minister be it right that young mother and her child can be threaten with homelessness if she refuse to uproot her life and leave the community where she be bear and raise where she grow up and where she have live all her life there be no consideration of her need the welfare of her child their health or their need to maintain family and support network thank my hon friend and constituency neighbour for give way similar thing have happen in my constituency do he agree that the way council be act be inhumane they be uproot people life and relocate they to unfamiliar place often into property with not even the basic amenity do he agree that that need to stop completely agree this be not care it be coercion homelessness be an ever present spectre of our time accord to survey by the big issue two third of private renter be worried about pay their rent and the potential adverse consequence for their housing situation at time of desperate need people should be able to trust their local authority to provide advice and support but what do they find they find system in which some family be be threaten intimidate and pressure into make potentially life change decision in moment of profound vulnerability congratulate the hon gentleman on secure this important debate he talk about the number of people who be vulnerable in my constituency of wyre forest we discover that so many people be be move from brent to birmingham that birmingham fill up and they have to come to kidderminster as well this be huge problem that have be go on for long time it be absolutely tragic for family who be separate from their family network their friendship network and the possibility of get job thank the hon gentleman for his intervention be not suggest that it be problem that affect only easington or county durham be try to highlight that it be an illegal practice hope to persuade the minister that there should be redress and some sanction against local authority that be break the law my hon friend the member for city of durham mary kelly foy say that the practice be immoral it be certainly questionable but it be also unlawful in supreme court judgment make it absolutely clear that local authority have statutory duty to provide accommodation in their own area so far as reasonably practicable the accommodation must be suitable to the need of the homeless person and each member of the household and the location can be relevant to its suitability the obligation to secure accommodation as close as possible to where the household have previously be live be strengthen by supplementary guidance on the homelessness change in the localism act and on the homelessness suitability of accommodation england order the supplementary guidance include the need to seek to retain establish link with school doctor social worker and other key service and support how be it possible to retain establish link to key service and support when family be relocate to an unfamiliar location over mile away section of the housing act require that where someone be relocate out of the area council must notify the receive local authority however that be not happen in response to my representation my local authority durham county council say we be aware of some household move into county durham with financial assistance from london boroughs largely discharge their homelessness duty into private rent tenancy placement tend to be in selective licensing area through small number of manage agent notably lettings and capital letters in accordance with homelessness guidance council who make referral to another local authority area should notify the receiving authority but this be generally not happen in these case and our referral number remain low the issue be not unique to durham county council there have be nearly decade worth of press article document case of london borough some london borough break the law and secretly relocate family thank my right hon friend the deputy prime minister for write to council chief executive to remind they of their legal obligation but must be candid about this contend that council chief executive know their legal responsibility and be choose to break the law what we need be enforcement and accountability ask the minister directly what practical step will she take to end these unlawful practice what sanction will be impose on council that continue to intimidate family disregard their legal obligation and fail to notify the receiving authority the family affect by these action deserve well and so do the community be ask to bear the burden of broken system county durham like many area face its own housing challenge which be overlook and ignore by the previous government our council budget be overstretch we have limit mean to raise revenue owe to low council tax base and service demand especially for social service and send provision be overwhelming our north east mining community be resilient but we do not have the resource to absorb the fallout of the london housing crisis without additional support respectfully do not underestimate the task face the minister the unlawful system of forcibly relocate vulnerable family through threat and intimidation be create by the previous government be plead tonight with the minister not to allow it to persist under labour government council that knowingly break the law need to be hold to account hope that she will explain how that be go to happen thank my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris for secure this important debate we can all agree that homelessness and rough sleeping level be far too high which have have devastating impact on those affect and have cause serious harm to family child and community address the current high level of homelessness and rough sleeping be priority for this government like the deputy prime minister absolutely recognise the pressure that local authority face and the soar cost of temporary housing as my hon friend have point out the challenge pose by out of area placement be also put pressure on council in many part of the country include county durham homelessness and rough sleeping have increase dramatically as member across the house will be aware in england homelessness be now at record level in march this year more than household include over child be live in temporary accommodation third of the household in temporary accommodation some household be in accommodation in different local authority district that be an increase of in the past year my hon friend raise an important point about the impact on different area in durham as of march this year there be household and child live in temporary accommodation it be an absolute scandal that family with child be live without permanent place to call home as my hon friend poignantly point out it be even more distressing that many of the family be force to move away from the area they know away from their friend family school and healthcare provider know how disruptive and tough that be because it have happen to constituent of mine who have be move much far away from where they grow up or where they be use to live this be the scale of the challenge we inherit from the previous government but we be absolutely determined to address this and to deliver the long term solution that be desperately need as my hon friend rightly say the relocation of homeless family outside london be drive by wide issue to do with supply and the fact that many local authority struggle to find accommodation for the homeless we have an enormous homelessness problem in birmingham with some family currently wait to get on to the property ladder but labour run birmingham city council be sell the commonwealth game development approximately family unit which could be use to accommodate these family birmingham city council with the support of the commissioner appoint because of the budget deficit will sell those unit at loss of some million to the taxpayer would it not make sense for the government to help retain those unit and put they to proper use will shortly come on to the proposal we be consider to support council as my hon friend the member for easington say council should place homeless household within their area in the first instance council should place household in another area only if no suitable accommodation be available in their own area however the lack of affordable housing option include temporary accommodation mean that local authority often do not have choice but to place people out of area although recognise the challenge that lead to family be place outside the area they be from be acutely aware of the impact on community in place such as easington and the other place that colleague have mention will my hon friend give way be conscious of time but will give way if my hon friend be very brief stress how devastating it be when family be move so far away from home family from islington have be place in my north west leicestershire constituency and sadly the old child be still in islington family be be split so would appreciate response thank you early this month the deputy prime minister write to local authority chief executive in england ask they to remind their council of the requirement to notify receive area when out of area placement be make and to assure themselves that these notification be be make it be crucial that local authority work in partnership to ensure that both host community and the household place out of area receive the appropriate support my hon friend the member for easington highlight some of the concern about that in legislation local authority be also responsible for safeguard this government be commit to deliver on big agenda we have set up dedicated inter ministerial group chair by the deputy prime minister to develop long term strategy to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping and the group include number of key departments we will deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in generation to provide million home over the next five year and the budget make an extra billion available for the affordable home programme which will deliver up to new social home there have also be proposal in relation to the right to buy and allow council to retain capital receipt so that they have the resource and flexibility to take action to increase supply and new five year social housing rent settlement which will give the sector certainty on funding and allow it to invest in ten of thousand of new home we recognise that the supply of housing be crucial if we be to bring an end to the plight of those who face homelessness and who be have to live in temporary accommodation and be move away from the place that they call home we be also commit to abolish section no fault eviction and the renters rights bill will give renter great security and stability to stay in their home for long and avoid the risk of homelessness on resource the government will increase funding for homelessness service by million next year follow the budget announcement that bring the total spend on homelessness and rough sleeping to nearly billion in the year that increase funding will help to prevent family from become homeless and will reduce the number enter temporary accommodation which be crucial we have to tackle the root cause of temporary accommodation use and the issue of out of area housing alongside that have already announce million of funding for local authority for rough sleeping pressure we have to recognise that some people end up go from temporary housing to rough sleeping which be also major concern hon member raise the issue of sanction the legislation in relation to temporary accommodation require that it be suitable for applicant and all member of their household when determine the suitability of accommodation secure under the homelessness legislation housing authority as minimum must ensure that all accommodation be free of category hazard as identify by the housing health and safety rating system the minister be be very generous the point that be try to make be not about sanction against the tenant they be the victim in all this often move against their will with coercive method employ do not know whether the minister have ever see the film daniel blake in which young woman call katie be put on bus from london and land in the north east that be the scenario that we be face some of the london borough that mention be knowingly break the law and there be no sanction against they they be not notify the receiving authority they be use manage agent and circumvent the rule appreciate my hon friend frustration as point out the deputy prime minister have already contact local authority and we will continue to keep what local authority be do under review commit to work with my hon friend to ensure that we support local authority as much as we can the resource that have be announce be key to reduce the need for local authority to send their resident to other place far away from the area in which they should ideally be house but we recognise that local authority face multiple pressure it be important that we prioritise identify where the barrier be in term of house building provide appropriate support to local authority and ensure that we monitor what happen in relation to the action of specific authority as say to my hon friend be keen that we work collaboratively to ensure that local authority take the necessary action to support those who be vulnerable we all know the vulnerability of many of our constituent who be in temporary accommodation it be key that they be keep as close to their network include their school and health provider as possible sympathise with the point my hon friend make other hon member make intervention which hope have cover be happy to continue the conversation on the specific issue they raise but broadly speak hope address many of their point once again thank my hon friend the member for easington for secure this important debate on subject that affect not only his constituent but many other as london mp be concerned that we ensure that local area have accommodation available to keep those in temporary accommodation close to their network and support structure that be why this government be determined to take action across departments in order to develop the strategy require to tackle the deep root cause of homelessness to ensure that we increase the supply of housing through our house building programme and to use the funding that have already be make available for social and affordable housing if we do not tackle the root cause of homelessness we will continue to have similar such debate be determined that we take the action necessary to address not only the short term pressure but the underlying cause that be create so much harm and make the life of child and family who be live in temporary accommodation an absolute misery we be determined to tackle the challenge they face very much hope that can work with colleague who have strong interest in this agenda as we move forward to tackle the homelessness crisis question put and agree to house adjourn
