today the levelling up housing and communities committee have publish special report on the response time of the department for levelling up housing and communities to the committee report thank the backbench business committee for kindly grant time to our committee for statement on the special report and thank the committee staff for their support to assist we in produce it the house have appoint our committee to scrutinise the department the issue that our committee consider affect the day to day life of constituent up and down the country during this session we have publish report on topic such as adult social care housing supply and funding for level up we have also investigate damp and mould and reform to the private rented sector two issue that be raise on daily basis in correspondence to the committee and in our mailbag as constituency mp we have hear evidence from hundred of witness who have give up their time to share their experience in some case harrowing and deeply personal experience to inform the committee work they do so in the expectation that our report and recommendation will influence government policy and improve people experience of public service for our scrutiny of government policy to be fully effective the government must consider and respond to our conclusion and recommendation sometimes the government will accept our recommendation and sometimes they will not what be important be that we receive response from the government their response demonstrate that they have consider the view of the committee and allow the public to see what the government be do in response to our inquiry it be well establish convention that the government should respond to all select committee report within two month of publication we understand that that will not always be possible perhaps during parliamentary recess or where recommendation be direct to more than one department however delay should be the exception not the rule and we expect open and proactive communication from ministers and official on the rare occasion when they expect government response to be delay the experience of our committee be that the department for levelling up housing and communities have historically and consistently fail to respond to our committee report within reasonable time during this session we have publish seven report and not one of the government response have be publish within the two month deadline on average government response to our report have be almost six month late the response to our report on funding for levelling up on the electoral commission strategy and on exempt accommodation be all late the response to our report on adult social care be eight month late the response to our report on social housing be month late the response to our report on permit development right be one year and eight month late we be still wait on overdue response to our report on reform to national planning policy and on reform the private rent sector our committee staff spend disproportionate amount of their time resource and energy attempt to engage with ministers and official through formal and informal channel to get response over the year as chair of the committee have see response be late but thing have get progressively bad in march the chair of the liaison committee write to the then leader of the house to highlight case of egregiously overdue government response the department for levelling up housing and communities be identify as repeat offender when it come to late response and be responsible for five of the example in that letter in january this year we ask the permanent secretary about his department failure to respond he say we need to make sure that it be an important responsibility of the department that we respond on time we have see little evidence that the department have take this responsibility more seriously indeed in the case of our report on reform in the private rented sector publish in february the lack of response have be deeply disappointing the two month deadline pass on april on may the secretary of state write to the committee to explain that the delay response will be publish alongside the introduction of the renters reform bill the bill be introduce on may but we have still not receive response to the report instead we have hear that response will be publish as soon as possible we have make seven separate formal request for the response as well as many informal request but we be still wait for the government response it be now more than five month overdue the committee broadly support the legislation on private rental reform and have make suggestion for its improvement we now need to hear whether the government plan to accept these recommendation and if not why not we expect response in april we be promise one in may we be now in september and still wait we be also wait for the second reading of the bill we hope to receive the response before second reading although that appear to have be somewhat delay as well it be imperative that the government fully consider the committee conclusion and recommendation in the report and publish full response imminently our special report call for government response on the private rent sector in the next two week along with an explanation as to what have cause the delay we have request an assessment from the cabinet secretary about these matter finally we have ask the liaison committee to consider formal review of government response time include our experience with this department in reality select committee power and effectiveness be significantly undermine when the government do not fulfil their responsibility towards it minister must be accountable to this house we as committee treat our responsibility to scrutinise the department and its ministers with the utmost seriousness it be time that the department for levelling up housing and communities take its responsibility to our committee and the house equally seriously the first step in do so must be to respond to our principal output our report in professional and timely manner normally take great pleasure in come to the house to report on the committee inquiry and finding it give no pleasure at all to have to make this statement today hope do not have to make similar statement in the future
