border but not to my constituent as accessibility to public transport remain one of my top priority will the minister push transport for london to extend those concession to every tfl user regardless of their address that be devolved matter but appreciate that tfl also subsidise many route outside that boundary be happy to pick up that matter with the hon gentleman outside the chamber in my constituency bus service be lifeline for resident of all age young and old be shocked to hear at recent meeting at hereford sixth form college that student this year have have to stop their study

assure she that we be committed to improve the accessibility of the railway it will be priority for great british railways the croydon area remodelling scheme would upgrade east croydon and norwood junction station in my constituency and improve service across the brighton main line and most of the south east however after the previous government withdraw fund for this vital infrastructure project passenger continue to suffer delay and opportunity for growth across the south east remain untapped give the government mission for growth and increase demand for rail service to gatwick airport will the secretary of state look again at the croydon area remodelle scheme and meet to discuss how invest in croydon transport structure could unlock growth across the south east be sorry to say that the previous government recklessly over promise on rail infrastructure project mislead passenger who have struggle for far too long to access the service that they deserve in fact would go as

scheme the secretary of state will know about the plan engineering work between didcot parkway and swindon and in the paddington area which will cause significant disruption between london and bristol and in south wales this sunday and next sunday disruption on major route cause massive chaos on the rural route that be access via bristol and far to the south west then there be the closure of the between bath and bristol which mean that there will be no bus between swindon and bristol on those day the alert about long and busy journey and train cancellation and delay advise we to travel the day before or the day after that do not seem adequate will the secretary of state please pull the rail bus and road body together to avoid clash such as this particularly when we face six year of further disruption as result of high speed work which will not benefit the south west in the slight the hon lady make fair point have readjust my own travel plan for this weekend feel her pain

government be determined to deliver we be work with the train operate company on plan to improve timetable and staff availability and rostering be happy to take away the specific issue that she have raise in relation to chichester and provide she with more detail on the intervention plan on that line call the shadow minister we be tell that nationalisation be the answer to improve passenger rail performance if that be the case surely it would make sense to start by nationalise the bad perform operator crosscountry come last out of all train operate company for passenger satisfaction and it be not comply with its obligation the secretary of state could call in that contract so why be it not the first operator to be nationalise under gbr we make commitment to bring the train operating company back into public ownership without any cost to the taxpayer the appropriate point at which to bring the train operating company back into public ownership be when the franchise expire if there be terrible performance we can seek to break contract early be pleased that there be some improvement at crosscountry we be see improvement from the train operating company that have be bring into public ownership in particular for transpennine and lner there be really positive story to tell on passenger journey and revenue growth thank the secretary of state for that answer but she duck the point that if she have the political will she could bring crosscountry in house now it be not the first operator to come under gbr or even close to it under current plan the government will not get around to tackle crosscountry until in the meantime highly effective private operator with some of the high level of customer satisfaction such as and greater anglia will be subject to dislocate nationalisation this year why be the government force nationalisation in area where current service be like and sit on their hand where people be cry out for improvement be not sure the hon gentleman listen to my previous answer say clearly that we be bring the train operating company into public ownership in way that offer good value for money for the british taxpayer the number of cancellation

harrogate business community he tirelessly campaign to improve our railway include get direct service from london to harrogate one of the issue that we speak about before he sadly pass away be how the leeds to york line via harrogate become single track at knaresborough which have implication for run high level of service and for delay as once one service be delay the entire day can quickly fall be launch campaign for the dualling of the line between knaresborough and york so that the railway serve our community be fit for purpose will the secretary of state join in that will she offer any advice on how we can go about secure that investment may express my condolence on the loss of the rail campaigner and constituent the hon member mention be aware that network rail be look at both electrification scheme and potentially long platform scheme for station that serve his constituency but recognise that he be talk about dual tracking may suggest that he seek meeting with the rail

to address diesel island which be section of track without electrification such as those between reading and my constituency to support the decarbonisation of the transport sector and encourage the

in kent improve access to local bus service throughout england be priority for this government our reform through the bus services no bill combine with the million we have allocate to kent county council in will empower local leader to deliver well bus service for passenger across kent conservative run kent county council recently confirm that million of the million grant provide by central

constituent in broadmead have no weekend bus service into town for example do the minister agree that that be shocking indictment of the service that the tories have preside over and that change in may at the local election be how we improve bus service for our constituent could not agree more with my hon and learn friend be absolutely clear that too often local bus service be not deliver for passenger right across the country that be why our ambitious reform to bus service include through the bus bill will give local leader the power they desperately need to reform service to well meet the need of passenger include in kent be proud that our reform to bus funding allocation have mean additional fund for bus across the country unlike under the conservatives who preside over million few bus mile in kent alone between and community buses category licence holders if she will make it her policy to allow holder of category drive licence to drive community bus be sympathetic to the hon member concern but to date there be not enough evidence to prove that the repeal of the legislation would not have an adverse impact on road safety since holder of car drive licence have not receive an automatic entitlement to drive minibus this be primarily to improve road safety my constituency be fortunate to have both dawlish community transport and newton abbot community transport they provide vital service for many people who would otherwise be isolate and lonely but like many other volunteer group they be find it hard to recruit recruit driver for their minibus service be particularly anyone who take their driving test before automatically get minibus class licence as do since then young driver have have to take new driving test the estimate associated training and cost be between and will the secretary of state work with to add exception to requirement to cover community transport and other volunteer community group unfortunately up to of driver who take the

more accessible for all my constituent my hon friend will be pleased to hear that charge point number increase by in rural area such as the one he represent and that the north east combine authority receive almost million from the local electric vehicle infrastructure fund which mean more public charge point for his constituent we be also support cross pavement solution that provide safe charge option for those without driveway as he describe electric vehicle charging infrastructure what assessment her department have make of the effectiveness of the roll out of electric vehicle charge infrastructure it actually follow rather well because order the minister have to answer the question first it be lovely that people be so keen charge point availability be increase everywhere as of march there be over uk public charging device with one add to the network every minute but we recognise that there be still regional disparity the local ev infrastructure fund will deliver further charge point right across england we new boy be still find our way mr speaker my part of the world yorkshire have the low ev charging point per head of the whole country the national audit office have point out that only of charge point be in rural area compare with in london and the south east the net zero aim will collapse if we do not fix the equitable provision of ev charging point what will the government do to correct those problem the right hon member be absolutely right to raise concern that although charge point availability be increase rapidly there be regional disparity and difference between urban and rural area the local ev infrastructure fund be design purposely to tackle some of that regional disparity as say charge point in rural area have increase by in the last year the east riding of yorkshire which cover the right hon member constituency have receive million in levi funding hope that that will deliver the improvement he seek for his constituent will the

speed limit of mph and be heavy which be cause quite lot of distress to many resident they can be speed limited and often be in our park have the secretary of state consider low speed limit for bike for safety reason cycle must comply with the exist regulation which state that electrical assistance must cut off when the vehicle reach mph the police already have the power to seize cycle and electric motorbike be use illegally and to fine individual who fail to stop when instruct to do so the secretary of state will recognise that it be very difficult for private landowner and local authority along the line of high speed to plan future development when they do not know what will happen to land that be necessary for construction but be not need for the long term operation of the line land disposal strategy for be overdue can she produce one urgently when she do so will she seek opportunity to benefit community like those represent which be suffer the disruption of the line

revert to diesel when travel on the part of the midland main line that be not yet electrify as electrification mean clean air less diesel and quieter and fast train do the secretary of state agree that the more of the track that can be electrify the well it will be for passenger community and the environment do agree that government investment in new bi mode train and electrification on east midland railway will result in low energy cost reduction in noise emission and significant improvement to the railway as the secretary of state will be aware the government move the money earmark for aldridge train station on the whim of the labour mayor sadly make aldridge resident feel that they be no long care about as the government say that they be minded to grant open access from wrexham to euston will they work with to demonstrate to the people of aldridge that they do actually care by work to deliver train station by as plan and budget for by the conservatives find it rather strange

for highway authority so that these crossing can be roll out across the country the government agree that everyone should have the opportunity to walk or cycle whatever their background and we will obviously study the content of the report in detail which correctly highlight some of the way in which cycle to work scheme for example might be reform the government agree that adapt cycle which be include in the report also play an important role in provide freedom and independence the root cause of the pothole problem be council inability to afford to resurface road wokingham borough council see no uplift in resurface funding for many year with no account take of inflation or new road this be legacy of the conservative party in government lead to maintenance funding per mile effectively be halve will the minister meet to discuss the urgent need for fund for resurfacing of new road be afraid that the hon gentleman local council have suffer the same fate as council across the country as result of the under investment in local road maintenance under the previous government but they will now have benefit from their share of our million uplift for the year ahead and they be absolutely encouraged to use that to resurface the road and fix pothole thank the minister for her answer on the work the government be do with business to support people deal with the consequence of the gig economy and road safety will she join with in my work to ensure that the area around baker street be safe for resident and will she work with and resident around baker street to make the case to gig economy business that we need to do more on enforcement and on the regulation of these worker my hon friend be absolutely right to raise concern obviously enforcement of the rule on use cycle and cycle be matter for the police but would be very happy to meet she to discuss the issue this week the government have give commitment to provide extra ev charge unit right across this united kingdom so may ask the minister very helpful question what discussion have she have with the northern ireland assembly in relation to expand ev charge infrastructure in the devolved nation how can we help northern ireland scotland and wales to catch up as departmental team we have regular meeting with our colleague across the devolved government include on issue of how to extend ev charging and

inexpensively could be reopen to carry tin and lithium out through the dock will the minister meet to discuss the possibility of do that this government be commit to move more freight from road to rail which be the right thing to do for our environment and our economy would be happy to have that meeting with my hon friend derby station have recently be reveal as the seventh bad for delay in the uk when people can not get to work on time it be not just pain for they it also impact productivity and hold back our local economy will the secretary of state outline the step she be take to tackle

cancellation and delay whether relate to train fleet staffing or infrastructure matter the reduction in funding for our waterway by year on year from will have detrimental impact on the operation of the dudley canal and caverns trust will my right hon friend commit to review of the funding of our waterway and reinstate that support be happy to look into that issue for my hon friend and provide

the royal bournemouth hospital and the airport do the minister agree that well bus be good for our community and our economy and that there be lot of growth to unlock in bournemouth and the south west with well bus my hon friend be fierce advocate for good public transport in his constituency and absolutely agree with the sentiment of what he say project willow report back last week among the option be hydrogenate ester and fatty acids plant produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel and the report recommend delay in the implementation of the hefa cap be the department currently consider that action be grateful to my hon friend for his commitment to project willow at grangemouth we introduce mandate from january so of all aviation fuel have to come from sustainable source we will be legislate on the revenue certainty mechanism and look at how we can contribute to the future of that great site pip changes impact on carer allowance urgent question to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions if she will make statement on the change to personal independence payment and how that will impact those who receive carer allowance the pathway to work green paper set out our plan to fix broken system provide proper employment support for those who can work and strong and sustainable safety net for everybody who need it we will change personal independence payment to focus support on those in the great need that change will be in primary legislation with full debate and scrutiny in parliament the cost of personal independence payment have increase by billion above inflation in each of the past five year and those increase be carry on that be simply not sustainable in the green paper we be consult on how good to support those affect by the change to eligibility for example with transitional protection for those no long eligible for pip and for the entitlement link to it include carer allowance as reference in the hon member urgent question and the universal credit carer element which be an increasingly important part of the picture the pip change will be implement from november next year they will apply to new claimant and to people at their award review after that date and those with severe condition who will never work will be protect pay tribute to the million of unpaid carer across the country we recognise and value their vital contribution provide care and continuity of support include to many people with disability the census indicate that approximately million people in england and wales be do some unpaid care as the hon member know we be deliver the big ever cash increase in the earning threshold for carer allowance increase it by week to benefit more than carer by our reform will build system that be fair and more sustainable so that it will always be there for those with the great need to live with the dignity and support that they be entitle to yesterday see the big cut to carer allowance for decade although we need to manage down appropriately the benefit budget that need to be do in way that be care compassionate and far from rush which be what we see yesterday we be look at approximately carer lose allowance under these proposal half billion pound will be take away from those who care the joseph rowntree foundation suggest that some couple will lose year when pip cut and carer allowance cut be take into account while welcome the apology that the chief secretary to the treasury give yesterday in relation to his reference to pocket money will the minister agree that it be inappropriate to compare cut to pip with cut to pocket money very much agree that this all need to be do in managed and compassionate way which be exactly what we be do so do not agree that it be be rush as have say the change will not happen for more than month they will not take effect until november they will not affect current recipient of personal independence payment until their first award review after november and review period be typically three year so this be definitely not be rush it will happen in properly plan stag and careful way the hon gentleman refer to couple lose think he must be refer to instance of people who receive personal independence payment and also receive carer allowance for care for their spouse he be right that there be some instance of that there be couple for whom that happen both way the transitional arrangement we be consult on which be refer to in the green paper need to take account of that incidence but it be absolutely the right thing to do to ensure that personal independence payment continue in the long term as part of sustainable benefit system we do have to make some reduction as think the hon gentleman acknowledge if he have another idea on how that can be do be interested to know what it be by concentrate on those whose impairment be the most severe which the propose change will do we will be able to ensure that the benefit be there for the long term and that it be sustainable do my right hon friend agree that in order to safeguard the future of the welfare system we must ensure that it be sustainable my hon friend be absolutely right we have to do that five year ago we be spend billion on personal independence payment and this year in current price we will spend billion the government have to address that precisely as he say in order to ensure that this crucial safety net be there for the long term we will not be mean test it freeze it or convert it into voucher as the conservative party suggest we want it to be cash benefit that can meet the need of those who depend on it call the shadow minister congratulate the hon member for torbay steve darling on bring this important matter before the house in government my party support carer we increase carer allowance by and with the support of the liberal democrats introduce carer leave we be unite again today in dismay at what this government be do the government have year to prepare their welfare reform we have nothing for eight month and then everything in rush because the chancellor crash the economy with growth this year cut in half inflation rise far unemployment up productivity down debt interest soar record tax burden and people be push into absolute poverty by the measure take by this government they have have an emergency budget contain cut to benefit for disabled people perhaps if they be not in such rush they would have realise that these crude reform also impact carer some people who give up income to look after love one and who rely on carer allowance to make end meet be now go to lose it the government be balance the book on the back of the people least able to take the weight that be labour make other people pay for the fiasco of their budget first they come for the farmer then for the pensioner and now it be the carer the most important people in our society do the most important job human being can do not for the money but for the love the least the government can do be to give they our support that be what we do in government so why will they not can the minister confirm whether carer allowance be deliberate target of the government reform or do they not realise the impact of what they be do to pip because of the rush they be in do they think that take million from carer while give above inflation pay award to the trade union be the right priority and do the minister share the chief secretary to the treasury view that cut support for carer and disabled people be like take pocket money from child be that what he believe carer allowance be pocket money suppose the hon gentleman have no choice but to attempt to defend his party record in government as have refer to already the conservative party plan be to convert pip into voucher that really frighten people who be dependent on that system and they also want to make some big cut to the work capability assessment which be rule out by the court as unlawful we announce in the green paper that we be go to abandon those cut for example the conservatives be propose to remove the mobility descriptor from the work capability assessment on the ground that people can now work from home but it be clearly ludicrous to claim that mobility impairment do not affect person ability to work remind the hon gentleman that in respond to the green paper on behalf of the opposition his hon friend the member for faversham and mid kent helen whately demand further cut so the outrage he have express be bit inappropriate we have proper plan set out in the green paper it have be well think through as the hon gentleman will find if he read it properly include reference to unpaid carer on its very last page we be well aware of the impact it will have which be why we be consult on the transitional arrangement thank my right hon friend for come before the house and calmly lay out some of the fact on this matter as would expect from he give his experience however there have be lot of fear out there and confusion among mps adviser and most worryingly people who be in receipt of pip and other benefit and be affect by these change do my right hon friend agree that clear communication at all time about this matter be very important and that every minister should be very careful about clumsy and inappropriate language because of the impact it have on the people who be most affected my hon friend be absolutely right about the sensitivity of this issue particularly regret the anxiety that have be cause by press speculation over the past several week that have certainly be regrettable from my postbag the thing that particularly frighten people be the point have already refer to which be the previous government proposal to switch pip from cash benefit to voucher that cause great deal of concern but my hon friend be right we now need to be absolutely clear in our communication about these matter think the green paper be clear the accessible version of the green paper will all be publish by the beginning of next month and we will then have week consultation period as result of those version include the easy read version be available hope that everybody will be able to see clearly what be propose and will be able to respond to the consultation with their view the analogy of the chief secretary to the treasury have prove to be controversial but the minister agree with the point he be make do he not do not hear what my right hon friend say what can say be that very large number of people be dependent on the personal independence payment we want it to be sustainable benefit that will be there for the long term because of the change we be make which will reduce the future increase in spending on personal independence payment we can be confident and recipient can be confident that that will be the case be potentially one of the few member of this house who have be recipient of the high rate of living allowance be recipient of the high rate of mobility allowance and rely on motability car for many year too on the flipside remember after my second hip replacement in my early have to try to navigate the access to work scheme which be pretty impossible in fact it lock people out of work rather than let they in there be many good thing in the green paper that have be bring forward that address some of those point when think back to what have to go through from age to be also pleased that those benefit will be protect for people in that situation pip be also what we call passporting benefit such thing as access to the blue badge scheme and carer allowance be often dependent on pip so one potential implication be that people could be lock out will the minister consider carry these thing forward and meet to discuss access to the blue badge scheme and carer allowance for people who might lose pip but would still be entitle to those benefit very much welcome my hon friend testimony to the value of the support that the system provide and the importance of maintain that into the future he be right about passporte benefit the availability of blue badge be not affect by anything in the green paper because the mobility component of personal independence payment be not change by any of the proposal we have make access to carer allowance as we have say certainly will be and would welcome discussion with he about that declare an interest as an honorary vice president of carers uk and sit on the board of the fife carers centre last september have the adjournment debate on support for unpaid carer in that the minister for care the hon member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock promise that we would forge ahead together with the promise of that future in which unpaid carer be visible value and support official report september vol that be not how unpaid carer be feel today the minister refer to how the earning limit for carer allowance have increase but there be still cliff edge be the government planning to bring forward plan to link the earning limit to the hour of employment at the national minimum wage we know that those be some of the thing that cause the overpayment for carer allowance in the first place yes the earning threshold will in future be set at time the hourly rate of the national living wage and that will continue indefinitely in addition the chancellor announce in the budget last year that we will look at the idea of an income taper in carer allowance to replace the cliff edge which as the hon member rightly say be feature of it at the moment we be look at that assessment thank my right hon friend for how he be respond to this urgent question the conservatives after year in government break our social security system and create hostile environment for disabled people and therefore it be for we labour in government to fix our social security system would like to press my right hon friend on this of disabled people already live in poverty and the propose change to personal independence payment could see more be push far into poverty and many be push out of work indeed the government impact assessment highlight that people could lose carer allowance or the carer element may press he again to think about how we ensure that we support ill and disabled people as we fix the mess that the tories have create my hon friend be absolutely right to say that we be leave with broken system may pay tribute to she for her work on the all party parliamentary group on eye health and visual impairment which focus on support people into employment that be the crucial element of this package we will invest substantial sum rise to billion year by the end of the parliament in support people who be out of work on health and disability ground into work and very much look forward to work with she in that endeavour when somebody who be out of work move into job the likelihood of their be below the poverty line be halve so there will be very positive poverty impact from that commitment have already be contact by carer in my constituency who be scared about what will happen to they and the people they care for welcome the minister explanation thus far but there will clearly be problem with encourage people who care for other to go out to work who will say who go to care for the person care for now what message do the minister have for those who look after very vulnerable people and can not leave they alone and who can not work be grateful to the hon gentleman for make that point give his description of the people be care for they will continue to receive personal independence payment once the change have take effect from november next year those who do not score at least four point on any of the daily living activity that the benefit condition set out will not be eligible for personal independence payment would need to look at the particular case that the hon gentleman have in mind but imagine that people who can not be leave alone at home will continue to score at least four point therefore the carer allowance for their carer will continue as at present have the high respect for my right hon friend but be afraid he be not right on this policy as former physiotherapist know that many people will not be able to claim carer allowance now that we have have the impact assessment we have see that nearly disabled people will be push far into poverty include child and that carer will lose the lifeline of carer allowance we do not have social care system to replace it besides social care be more expensive today want to speak truth to power sometimes government get thing wrong and ask the government to seriously reflect on these policy the first half of pathway to work be good but the second half will let lot of people down please reflect and please withdraw this policy be grateful to my hon friend but we will not withdraw the policy we will certainly reflect on it and we will consult properly on the content of the green paper the figure publish by the office for budget responsibility yesterday show that the benefit change on their own will take people include adult below the poverty line but that be before any consideration of the impact of the big commitment that we be make to employment support up to billion year by the end of the parliament that will clearly have very positive effect in reduce poverty the office for budget responsibility will look at all of this over the summer and then update its figure in the autumn we will see what it conclude but think the balance of this package will be very positive for reduce poverty in the uk to help family the last government put in place the household support fund which this government have continue however it be due to run out in when the minister change be come in what hope be there for household who need emergency support if the household support fund will be drop when his change come in we have retain the household support fund as the hon member rightly point out and the future arrangement will be set out in due course however can reassure he of the absolute commitment of this government to support family who need our support the child poverty taskforce be work on this issue at the moment and will bring forward strategy to address the problem of child poverty the figure publish this morning on household below average income show just what huge challenge there be give the very high level of child poverty leave by the previous government we will be address that thank the minister for pay tribute to carer for the economic and social contribution they make and for the big ever increase in the employment earning threshold for carer there be lot of worry about the change so could the minister confirm that nobody on pip will be impact by they until november at the early in the meantime will be work with disabled group in my constituency to understand the impact on individual and the impact of the investment on support disabled people into work the minister speak about transitional arrangement how can ensure that the view of disabled people in newcastle upon tyne central and west feed into decision about the implementation of these change my hon friend be absolutely right to underline again the hugely important contribution not least economic contribution make by carer the consultation be under way and it will run for full week from the time when all the accessible version of the green papers be publish which will be in early april would be very grateful if she encourage the organisation that she be work with to respond to that consultation and would also be very interested to hear and see her response to it we will take those contribution extremely seriously as we finalise the detail of these proposal before put my question to the minister be sure that the house will want to join in offer condolence to keith brown our deputy party leader on the death of his wife christina mckelvie who be very distinguished and long serve member of the scottish parliament and minister the impact assessment sneak out yesterday under cover of the spring statement confirm what the snp have be warn about for some time labour austerity cut will have devastating effect with the poor and most vulnerable in society force to foot the bill for the chancellor incompetence some people will be affect by the change to carer allowance but also at an absolute people include child will be force into poverty these be very modest assessment hear the hon member for york central rachael maskell give figure of people labour promise that it would improve living standard but with the full extent of the damage now spell out do labour promise not lie in tatter what will it take for the government to change course before irreversible harm be do echo the hon gentleman condolence the figure be certainly not snuck out yesterday do not think anyone can accuse the office for budget responsibility of sneak they out they be publish on the day of the spring statement as they always be and always have to be let make it clear that spend on the personal independence payment will continue to increase above inflation it will not increase as fast as it would have do if we have do nothing but the advantage be that the funding for that benefit will be sustainable and that be vital because so many people depend on it it be not go to be mean test and it be not go to be freeze it will be there for the long term there be real fear among many of my calder valley constituent with disability and with caring responsibility about the propose change to pip and that fear have be exacerbate by some of the reporting can the minister please give categorical assurance that the consultation on these measure be genuine and that the government will ensure that the response of disabled people and of disability right campaign such as scope will be give the weight they deserve my hon friend be absolutely right to raise those point can give he the assurance that he seek indeed speak to scope yesterday and to other disability charity yes this will be proper consultation and we will listen very carefully to what people say to we in response terminal illness devastate people finance more than terminally ill people every month be refuse pip and every day people die in poverty have fall through the crack of our benefit system many family carer in the midst of bereavement be then leave with nothing the government plan in the green paper say nothing about how the terminally ill or their carer will be affect by these cut can the minister guarantee today that they will not be plunge into deep poverty be grateful to the hon member for raise that point but the green paper be very clear about the protection provide for people who be terminally ill there be special rule in place and they will absolutely be maintain she can be very much reassure about what the green paper say about that group if there be point that have miss that she have spot would be grateful to hear about it but we have very robust protection for those people for exactly the reason she set out grow up care for two disabled parent as say in my maiden speech would not be here if it be not for the sacrifice they make when they have so little in the first place have see both my mother and my father force out of work by their poor health have see their mental health suffer because they could not get foot in the door of the nhs have see the consequence in our family home they suffer significant bout of depression know the dignity and importance of work to people who want to and can work when my parent health get bad they could not work so know the importance of protection for people like they be pleased that the government be emphasise both part of the issue will the minister please assure my constituent who be concerned because of the leak into which an official inquiry be under way that the government be truly listen to our constituent will he give the assurance that through the pathway to work consultation the government want to hear from disability group in my constituency include the cambian wing college whose representative meet on monday and other organisation will he also reassure the public that the government be commit to close the disability employability gap we need employer to support people into work too understand that this be very important urgent question that be why it be grant but need to try to get everybody in that be what be bother about if we can speed up question and answer that would help we all be grateful to my hon friend for bring his experience to this debate can absolutely give he the reassurance he seek early in the week write to the secretary of state ask she to confirm that the plan would not go ahead if the proposal be assess as be harmful to disabled people the equality analysis say that the family who will lose out be estimate to represent of all family who report have someone with disability in the household give that pip be not relate to work and that the money can not be make up through work change do the minister agree that proceeding be not acceptable when there be this level of harm the assessment publish yesterday be that of those receive the daily live pip component will continue to receive that benefit after the change take effect so think the concern that the hon lady raise be not entirely appropriate like thousand of other carry out my caring responsibility this morning before come to this place have first hand experience of worry about pay the bill every month due to caring responsibility something no long have to worry about will the minister consider whether we need plan across government departments to identify the support available to ensure that carer can work and that they and their loved one do not fall into poverty as result of the announcement make be work with the minister for care in the department of health and social care on this agree with my hon friend that we need to work across government on these issue we need to be concern about the effect on young carer in the education system so the department for education need to be involve as well his point about cross government work be absolutely right almost third of all unpaid carer in wales live in poverty that be over people care for the sick the elderly and the disabled the labour first minister in wales eluned morgan have already ask for wales specific impact assessment of welfare cut she have not even have the courtesy of reply can the minister tell how many more unpaid carer in wales will be push into hardship due to lose their entitlement to carer allowance as the hon lady will have gather the impact assessment be publish yesterday the figure be there for everybody to see and the impact be across the uk that be correct want the support that we provide to be sustainable in the long term for those who depend on it that will be the impact of our change to the personal independence payment also want well support for carer who want to combine work with caring that be not always easy for people to do we make commitment to provide up to billion in well employment support by the end of this parliament if we can use that to support carer as well as people who be sick and disabled we could see significant reduction in the number of people live in poverty like many member have have email from constituent who be worried about these change can the minister confirm that the most disabled people who will never work will be protect that he be consult on new high rate of universal credit for those who be most severely disabled and that the chancellor billion investment in employment support will help those disabled people who could work to find good quality job which be the good route out of poverty thank my hon friend for her work on disability employment which have be an important contribution can give the reassurance she seek as someone who live with ulcerative colitis be all too acquainted with the fact that health condition can vary wildly we know that people with condition such as crohn and colitis and their carer already have issue access pip and carer allowance what consideration have the minister give to condition such as those in the context of these cut it be very important that the system properly handle fluctuate condition one of the benefit of the proposal in the green paper to record by default pip assessment be that we will be able to provide well assurance that the assessment get these judgment right particularly in the case of fluctuate condition know from speak to charity local group and people from brilliant project such as jobsmart in my constituency about the increase complexity of the relationship between different form of benefit include carer allowance and the rule around work that make it increasingly difficult for people to use the option they have can my right hon friend assure the house that the record amount of employment support will address the issue of the flexibility that we need to support sick and disabled people into some form of work and will not just be for mentor for those in other category my hon friend be absolutely right and join he in pay tribute to organisation such as jobsmart in his constituency when the previous labour government introduce the new deal for disabled people in be the minister then as be now the disability employment gap start to fall and it fall steadily all the way until when it stop fall want to get we back to that positive downward trajectory the minister be an honourable man have know he long time and know that he try to be compassionate and helpful but have deep concern about this it would appear that the book be to be balance on the back of the vulnerable have genuine concern that the outworking of the spring statement may push some people with severe mental health problem over the edge how will the government put in place great support for those who have to battle their recognise illness and live not just survive in this pressure fill world that will be even hard after these change be implement be grateful to the hon gentleman for his kind word at the start of his question our proposal fully protect the personal independence payment of those with the most severe impairment think those be the people that he be concerned about and they be fully protect under these plan obviously the work of carer be important as we have be hear can the minister help with one constituent case he be carer but be now suffer from long covid and would be due pip what will happen to he under the point system an assessment will be carry out by properly train health professional if the person to whom my hon friend refer score more than four point on any one of the daily living activity they will be eligible for personal independence payment as at present it be shocking that one in eight of our young people be not in education employment or training want this to be country in which all work age people include young people feel that sense of opportunity again know how important work be in lift people out of poverty also know that it be in our dna as labour party to be there for people who be disabled vulnerable or not able to work will the minister share how that billion year support package will help those who can work get into work and do he agree that we will always have the back of those who can not work and those who care for they my hon friend be absolutely right we will be work with disabled people over the next few month on the plan for how that commitment should be take forward we say in the get britain work white paper before christmas that we will be set up disability employment panel specifically to work on those plan will be very keen to work with she on those detail as we draw they up rise order member will need to move little fast as will the minister many of my constituent will welcome the reform to get more people off benefit and into work many recognise the urgent need to make our welfare system more sustainable but many also deeply worry about not just the impact on carer but the impact assessment that suggest that more child will be push into poverty by can the minister assure not just about the transitional arrangement to help both parent and child but that this summer child poverty taskforce will take urgent step to correct the impact assessment and that parent and child will be score urgently in any future impact assessment that the government come up with my hon friend be right to highlight the challenge of high level of child poverty certainly can give he the reassurance that he seek think the employment impact will be very positive on future child poverty but the work of the child poverty taskforce will be as well and yes that will be fully score once the policy have be announce be grateful to the government for focus on get people back into work because it give they pride power and ownership but as ever it be not what you do but how you do it say to the minister that rather than allay my concern the impact assessment have actually give several more ask he to find time to meet so that we can go through two thing the concern that my constituent in newcastle under lyme have and those that have too will gladly meet my hon friend and look forward to the meeting welcome my right hon friend commitment to improve the experience of people go through the assessment process as be regularly shock by some of the experience of my constituent can he say little more about how he will improve claimant

opportunity to discuss it with he scunthorpe steelworks urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade to make statement on the future of scunthorpe steelwork first my thought be and the thought of all hon member will be with british steel worker and their family follow the company announcement of plan to close the blast furnace and other steelmaking asset at scunthorpe and its commercial decision to consult on redundancy this be not what we want and know how worrying it will be for all those involve be grateful to my hon friend the member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin who be in his constituency today engage directly with his local community in the immediate term we must support the people who work at british steel our contingency plan have kick in to ensure that all possible support be make available to british steel workforce both the department for work and pensions and the department for education will have team on the ground shortly to engage with employee for as long as necessary we have ask british steel that official be give direct access to british steel site to bring their support as close as possible to affected worker this government inherit steel sector in crisis and resolve the long stand uncertainty around the future of scunthorpe have be priority from our first day in office that be why when we commit up to billion of investment to support our steel industry we earmark substantial funding to support british steel in addition to the funding allocate to our new and improved deal with tata steel confirm today that we have take another significant step forward on monday my right hon friend the business and trade secretary make generous conditional offer of financial support to british steel design to deliver sustainable future for the workforce industry and local community in the light of the challenging fiscal context this speak volume about our commitment to the steel industry the offer follow month of intensive engagement with british steel to reach deal that meet our public accountability and legal requirement work for local people and uk taxpayer safeguard as many job as possible and ensure the company long term commercial viability the offer that we have make be conditional on british steel meeting those key test which be consistent with our approach to similar investment deal the company must provide the commitment that we need and which taxpayer would quite rightly expect in exchange for substantial public funding it be regrettable that it have not yet do so or accept our offer therefore call on the company to reconsider its plan to announce early closure accept our condition and accept our generous offer which remain on the table assure the house that we be work tirelessly to find solution we believe that there be bright future for steelmaking in the uk and we call on british steel to work in partnership with government who care deeply about the steel sector to put the business on sustainable footing for the future and to put an end to the year of uncertainty at scunthorpe thank the minister for her statement and for the update that she have provide to in recent week as she say there will be increase anxiety among the workforce today and we look to the government to provide maximum support for the sake of clarity will the minister confirm that the government do wish to maintain blast furnace production until an alternative arc furnace installation be up and run will she also confirm that they want to maintain production to meet the demand of the defence sector particularly in view of the recently announce increase spending the minister will be aware of the project that north lincolnshire council have propose such as the green growth zone and those in the artificial intelligence sector will she confirm that she will support they she will also be aware of other project in the region that be look for government support will she confirm that she will look sympathetically on they also although would not want to advocate this will the government consider nationalisation of the industry as last resort thank the hon gentleman for the manner in which he have represent his constituent today and engage with we previously on the point of clarity confirm that we would rather the blast furnace remain open he know that if they close before supply of steel be secure that would be significant in term of customer confidence and what will happen to the customer base on the hon gentleman point about defence as be say at the business and trade committee yesterday there be reason why the russians bomb the blast furnace in ukraine first steelmaking capacity be need not just for defence but for build the structure require for construction he be therefore absolutely right on that front this morning meet the council and talk about both the plan for we to work together on british steel and the wide question of what else we can do in the region and how the government can support that small ministerial team have be come together to think about those thing on the hon gentleman final point as he know the amount of money that we be talk about to develop new infrastructure be significant our preferred approach by far be that british steel come back to the table talk with we about the offer on the table and we have that private sector investment in the future but of course we be look at all option call the chair of the business and trade committee may welcome the minister explicit ambition to retain primary steelmaking capability on these island hope the whole house will row in with that also welcome the billion that the government have earmark for investment in the sector will she however put rocket up the trade remedies authority we have hear very clearly from steelmaker that they need the same safeguard against divert chinese steel flooding into our market that will click into place in europe in april it be not acceptable that we have to wait until the summer for our market to be safeguard in the same way the tra need to act and it need to act now thank my right hon friend for his question and his contribution through the select committee session we have yesterday the tra announce yesterday that it will widen its review of uk steel defence it have accept the challenge from uk steel to do just that and be act the secretary of state and other will be look to make sure our steel defence be as strong as they need to be today news about scunthorpe sit alongside the wide issue about tariff and the global trade of steel we need to make sure we be help in that space too call the shadow minister the news from scunthorpe be deeply concern job be at risk and our thought be with all those who now face uncertainty the world be become more dangerous and we need to bolster our defence industry without the ability to produce our own primary steel those effort could be put in jeopardy what impact do the minister believe the news will have on britain defence industry and what impact do she believe closure would have on our national security it take special something to be able to offer someone million and for they to reject it but whatever it be guess the business secretary have it whenever labour negotiate britain lose whether with mauritius astrazeneca or now british steel the government confirm that and so far at least that appear to be the case with the united states too the government pretend that tariff on steel be inevitable which as we show in government be simply not the case therefore will the minister update the house on united states trade negotiation in particular in relation to steel will the minister confirm that the business secretary have engage far with jingye since it reject he tariff be but one challenge face the industry alongside the job tax and the unemployment bill the steel industry be be choke by the government ideological green target will the minister tell the house what concern british steel have express about those net zero target as say at the beginning this news will be deeply concern for steelworker in scunthorpe have the minister or the secretary of state speak with they about the news and if so what support be they be offer do not want to insult this house by suggest that there be any kind of deal on the table under the previous government and that anything happen on steel other than halving of production over the last decade halving lot of thing shut down and close during that period not just in the steel industry but in many other look at my hon friend the member for redcar anna turley for proof of that whether in steel in shipbuilding or in the automative sector the previous government have neglect to take major decision or have kick the can down the road all we inherit be series of industrial crisis that we be now try to solve we deliver well deal with port talbot than have be negotiate under the previous government we be still in talk with british steel and hop that we can come to resolution and not just because of the very many very highly skilled worker in scunthorpe who we respect honour and want to make sure stay in their job have nothing more to say on that front on tariff and the situation with the us we be in good position in this country in that the relationship that our prime minister have build with president donald trump and his team mean that we be in active conversation about potential trade deal this be good positive thing and we be carry on have those conversation my right hon friend the secretary of state have be talk regularly with our american counterpart as member would expect we will have cool head in this space and navigate our way through we our official be talk daily with british steel we be talk with the trade union and all the player to try to ensure that in the difficult global landscape that we find ourselves in we be do right by the people of scunthorpe draw the house attention to my background as an official of the gmb steelworker union that union support for my constituency party and my membership of gmb and unite the three steelworker union gmb unite and community have put forward multi union plan for scunthorpe will the minister meet those union urgently include with cross governmental officer so that we can do everything possible to keep that multi union plan on the table take this opportunity to pay tribute to the trade union gmb community and unite which we have be work with closely we have be discuss their plan as say our preference be that british steel accept the deal the incredibly generous offer of public funding we have give it we hope we can find way forward that involve keep the blast furnace open but we be of course look at every other option and we certainly have be talk to the trade union about their suggestion call the liberal democrat spokesperson like the minister my thought be with the british steelworker and their family follow the closure of the scunthorpe site it be not close yet it be go to from electric vehicle to wind turbine high quality green steel be an important component of our transition to low carbon economy the government need to move rapidly from the conservative legacy of patchwork of last minute rescue to genuinely long term approach that be effective for british industry and do not harm british worker what be the government do to ensure that community in teesside and scunthorpe be support against job loss when will the government realise that sit on our hand and hop that trump will not hit we with even more tariff be not good negotiating strategy will the minister take strong approach and bring forward retaliatory measure against donald trump political ally such as his co president elon musk and his company tesla can reassure the hon gentleman that we be not sit on our hand and there be good reason why it would not be right to comment in this place on the internal negotiation between this government and the united states we will rightly keep cool head in those conversation and ensure that we be ultimately do what be right for our industry and our people but we be in good position in that we be engage in deep conversation with the us and will continue to do that the hon gentleman ask about the support for local people there be various stage the starting point be that we very much hope that we can come to deal and negotiate with british steel that it will accept what we be offer and that we can move forward on those term in the short term the department for work and pensions and the department for education will be there on the ground ensure that people be get the immediate support they need if the consultation continue and there be closure of course much more intervention to support local people would need to kick in we be already work on all manner of contingency to ensure that we support people as we be do in port talbot but our aim be absolutely not to get to that point call select committee member sonia kumar the uk now produce less steel than our european neighbour germany italy spain france austria and poland and over the past year china share of global steel production have rise from to to safeguard the future of the steel industry we must think about diversification do my hon friend agree that support british small and medium sized enterprise into the steel industry will make it more competitive and sustainable thank my hon friend for that conversation and all her work with the steel industry in her constituency the steel strategy that we be put together which will be publish in the spring with billion to invest will consider how to stimulate demand use research and development and get the most out of scrap in the uk as well as look at trade and overcapacity carbon leakage and the availability of site there be whole raft of work go on she be right about ensure that there be an industry for the big and small player that be what we be work through and look forward to work with she on that call the father of the house scunthorpe neighbour my constituency and many of my constituent who work there will be desperately worried today this be vital national interest crisis for the past year war have be win by state that can make virgin steel will the government do anything tariff or the secretary of state go up to scunthorpe now to negotiate directly with the company to ensure that we keep our vital national interest go which mean blast furnace as the right hon gentleman would expect the secretary of state be and have be talk to jingye as have and official those negotiation will continue the site at scunthorpe produce lot of different type of steel as he will know it provide of all steel use by network rail it be incredibly important in that sense and he be right to draw attention to that there be many different way of make steel on the primary steel point we be investigate the merit of invest in direct reduce iron which be when hydrogen be use instead of the old blast furnace the reality be that the scunthorpe blast furnace be old infrastructure decade old that need update we need to move to new technology and that be what we be try to do with jingye clearly the absence of an industrial strategy in the past five year have have an impact so welcome the government notion of steel plan give that the industrial strategy feature three major element construction defence and energy infrastructure will the steel plan look not at year horizon but at one of to year to ensure that we get the investment we need for the uk to have virgin steel production like all other country of the thank my hon friend for his question and for his expertise as member of the select committee we have this debate yesterday yes have long view have to be the right thing the government must ensure that we spend that billion of taxpayer money in the right way to secure the industry well into the future as the grandson of steelworker in corby northamptonshire understand something of the iconic nature of the industry the hon lady try to blame we conservative for what go wrong be the situation not too confused the government be not send the right signal to the industry and we be not sure what we want we already do not make the right kind of steel for much of the defence industry the steel strategy will be publish in the spring wonderful when be the spring the government need to get grip and send out signal now if we be go to negotiate with the chinese about the scunthorpe mill and the amount of money we be spend there should we not have some kind of golden share so that taxpayer be comfortable about what be go on there can assure the hon gentleman that very much have grip we be work with official the secretary of state and other all the time in term of the condition that he suggest we should put on the offer of funding the offer we make be conditional on job target fair term for worker adhere to uk law protect taxpayer money whole raft of condition be set and need to be adhere to as for the hon gentleman haste there be no steel strategy in the year of the previous government we be develop one be not go to stand in front of taxpayer in my constituency and say have spend billion just on whim we have to get this right we be work with industry be at celsa in cardiff this week at roundtable of the scrap industry and the steelmaker talk about the plan have do roundtable with all the industry that buy steel to ensure that we understand what demand will be over the come year we be get this right which be what the taxpayer would expect of we my hon friend the member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin be in scunthorpe right now support our fantastic steelworker many of my constituent work in scunthorpe know that they will be feel extremely anxious and my heart go out to they will the minister confirm that she remain steely in her determination to secure the future of the uk construction and steel industry and that she will do everything she possibly can to support my constituent who be affect my hon friend constituent who work for british steel will of course be deeply worried when be last there in february talk to worker the union and management this be proud industry of good job with good salary compare with the local average be well aware of how anxious those worker will be feel hope they can take some comfort at least from the fact that we be do absolutely everything we can to secure deal with british steel it be difficult to listen to the minister at the dispatch box say that everything be okay with the united states because of the positive relationship between the prime minister and the president when it can be characterise as the president say jump and the prime minister ask how high the us have visit precisely the same tariff on the uk steel industry as on the chinese if that be special relationship would hate to see what an ordinary relationship look like when will the government get grip on the production of primary steel it be non negotiable for nation to produce primary steel it be intrinsic to our defence and security the government seem to be try to negotiate situation that be the bad of all world whereby the taxpayer have to stump up the money but the private sector in china get to dictate the term do not recognise that frame at all we be in well position than many other country in term of the strength of our relationship with the us and the building up of relationship that have happen over recent month as say the secretary of state be in regular talk with his counterpart and we be have constructive talk with our counterpart we can not go into the detail of those negotiation but can assure the hon gentleman and the house that we have cool head we know what we want and we will do what be good for our industry in the long run on the matter of primary steel and steelmaking in the uk we need our defence and our security to have strong vibrant steelmaking production in the uk there be different way to do that include with different technology which be move all the time that be why the steel strategy need to anticipate where technology be go and make sure we get that right think the minister be give few mixed message if may say so the government be send support people to counsel those who may be out of job and be make an offer to the firm that will actually be provide those job to try to cushion the blow the sad reality be that if those blast furnace close down they will not be recoverable so the first thing that have to happen be ensure that they be not close down the consequence would be the steel industry go into steep decline with more people unemployed we would then have to import steel from china at much high cost why will we not give guarantee that the blast furnace will not close down be sure the hon gentleman know that this be private company that will make decision of its own we be operate within that environment we have put an offer on the table that be about the development and redevelopment of scunthorpe the creation of an electric arc furnace and the transition for that the offer be still on the table and we be still talk to the company about it the reason that we be there on the ground now be that the company have decide to launch consultation on redundancy and it be right and proper that we be there to provide support to worker commend the minister and the secretary of state for their hard graft to secure deal in the interest of my steelworker in teesside and those in scunthorpe it be deeply concern that jingye have choose to reject the generous offer that be on the table be sure stand with member across the house in urge jingye to come back to the table and secure that deal will the minister reaffirm that all option remain open include strong national intervention to protect our steel industry and make sure that british steel be make here in britain know that my hon friend be work hard on behalf of his constituent appreciate be able to talk to he in the run up to this can reassure he that this government want to deliver vibrant steel industry in the uk we be very well aware of the importance of british steel and of the scunthorpe site and associate site we be do all we can to make sure that we keep that operation go we all know that steel and particularly the ability to make primary steel be critical national industry the chinese might be give up on british steel but the british people do not want to give up on british steel nor should we allow the final two blast furnace to close may urge the minister to take this not as negative but as an opportunity to be positive we should take british steel into public ownership and create long term to year positive plan to invest in steelmaking for british industry and for our defence industry through our plan for steel and the billion that we be invest in the steel industry we be aim to do exactly that to keep the industry go invite the hon gentleman to go and see the other site around the country where we have electric arc furnace in operation because they be not that different from blast furnace they be still massive building melt and make the steel but in much more efficient way the problem we have with scunthorpe be that the blast furnace be very old and will need huge amount of money spend on they and of course british steel be lose day on scunthorpe this be not about ideology or particular political belief this be about economic and about make sure that we protect our country that we provide the defence we need and that we be as secure as we can be in change world on that agree with the hon gentleman thank my hon friend for her statement know that she be do all she can on the issue we can not have defence industrial strategy unless we have our own primary steelmaking facility so clearly we can not let these furnace close be interested to hear what the minister say about have various meeting in whitehall and with the treasury when be she likely to be able to come back to the house and report on the progress make on this issue and importantly on steel strategy for the long term not just five or year but year or more can reassure my hon friend that the treasury be completely committed to have plan for steel we talk to my right hon friend the chancellor lot about this when we be in opposition just as we have be do in government the very generous offer put on the table to british steel be sign off as be quite right by the chancellor and by the prime minister they be both commit to this we will be come back in the spring with the steel plan in which we will set out how we will spend the rest of the fund that we have in the meantime again urge british steel to come back and talk about the offer that be on the table and see whether we can come to deal give the geopolitical uncertainty usher in by the new american administration and by america and china attitude to net zero will the minister assure the house that in make decision on the future of critical national infrastructure that touch upon the defence of this country such as the extraction of shale gas and the continuance of blast furnace produce virgin steel she will be very careful about do anything that would reduce this country capability to stand on its own two foot will certainly ensure that we do not do anything that reduce our ability to stand on our own two foot can give the right hon gentleman that assurance thank the minister for her comment on the national steel strategy and for agree to meet the owner of union electric steel in my constituency do she agree that continue to be able to produce cast steel roll in the uk be an essential part of the steel strategy that will benefit scunthorpe port talbot and other community be very much look forward to the meeting with my hon friend constituent who be an important part of the steel chain he make an important point we make many different product and have many different asset in the uk that we need to protect beyond the big six steel company it be now clear that domestic virgin steel production be national security imperative act on it be not act on whim will the minister respond to her hon friend and to conservative members by recognise that domestic virgin steel production be national security imperative whether it be through nationalisation golden share or the other idea that have be suggest if it be national security imperative we must act regardless of technology will the minister please tell the house that she agree with that madam deputy speaker you will recognise the conversation that we be have from your experience as minister of state in the department for business energy and industrial strategy the opposition seem to have new find enthusiasm for virgin steelmaking that in government they do not have at all we will make sure that we be do the right thing interruption do not have time to go into this conversation at this point but will be very happy to have it with the right hon gentleman there be some important point to note include that we make lot of our steel for defence not from primary steel but in electric arc furnace it be about get the right mix that be what we will make sure we do last week visit british offsite whose chief executive officer hail from my constituency of harlow about the innovative house building that it be do use technique that require lot of steel although have to say that it use it efficiently what meeting have the minister have with house builder as well as with the defence sector as she rightly say as part of the government steel strategy meet house builder regularly have some meeting with they today the production and recycling of steel be important to construction as be some of the off take from steel that can be use to make cement there be recycling that can be do on that front as well we need lot of steel to build the million home that the government want to build so we need to make sure that the steel industry be strong thank the minister for her answer we all share her frustration about the process the news that the government offer of funding to retain job at scunthorpe be to be reject certainly outline the difficulty in british business no long be own by those who have an interest in british job my thought be with the worker today who be look at their child and their mortgage repayment and wonder how they can make it work out when all they want to do be work how can the government give confidence to worker in scunthorpe and in industry that rely on steel throughout the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland so that they know that way forward can be find the hon gentleman be absolutely right to talk about how we can give comfort in what be very difficult time we be not shy away from that at all the immediate support that we will provide through the department for work and pensions and the department for education be important if there be closure there will be big transition board through which we will support people as much possible and ensure that they get skill and training as he would expect the comfort that we can give people now be that we be try as hard as we can to make sure that closure do not happen business of

start by thank the whole house for their wonderful message of condolence during last week business question could not be more grateful single out in particular the leader of the house for her very gracious remark turn from father to mother as this sunday of course be mother day the infant shadow leader of the house have be instruct not that they need it on how to manage the occasion be sure that the whole house will want to join in celebrate mother at the weekend and express ourselves in all kind of way to thank our mother and the mother we have among we for all the work they do this have be the week of the spring statement the house will recall the october budget in november of last year it be describe as once in generation budget with no tax rise to follow this week we have see that the chancellor own growth forecast just four month later have be halve and she have increase cut to welfare benefit that follow the interesting strategy of abolish nhs england have just fire all the team run it the tax burden be on track to hit record high in we should give credit where credit be due the chancellor have protect capital investment which be very important and correct decision but there have also be wheeze be sorry to say that she have somewhat pull the wool over the eye of the office for budget responsibility in relation to housing growth which be the government new get out of jail free card it have never be include in an obr estimate before and it be very doubtful and unlikely that it will happen in any case even at those level the target have already be downgrade from million house to million house because of the plan upheaval in local government meanwhile the immensely damaging employment rights bill go entirely unscored economically by the obr we will see what it say about that piece of legislation next time around the brutal fact be that although the government claim to prioritise growth growth have halve since they come into power they have talk about little else but even their own forecast do not show growth get back even to by the end of the decade and every major independent expert forecast of the economy future growth be low than that of the obr what do we see if we look more closely the spring statement be not really about work at all it be about move people from welfare into lower pay welfare the cut to universal credit announce last week have be follow by freezing of universal credit why it be because that appear to hit the chancellor own fiscal headroom number to the decimal point last week we hear all the rhetoric about the moral case for nudge people back into work but now it seem that this be actually an accounting exercise and the economic and moral justification for the policy have be lose sight of the second point be the question whether artificial intelligence which the government have greatly emphasise will actually have the effect of increase growth the chancellor suggest that this idea be somehow obvious and conventional wisdom but that be very far from true the nobel prize win economist bob solow famously say that the effect of the it revolution could be see everywhere except in the economic number other country be scale and deploy artificial intelligence with massive speed and many expert believe that ai could increase unemployment and inequality and raise the cost of retrain people and reintegrate they into the workforce far from create economic growth the advent of ai could end up force government possibly this government into even more spending than they presently contemplate finally we get to the vexed and much discuss issue of so call fiscal headroom or to use more technical phrase the goolie in vice problem it have be suggest that the definition of insanity be to keep do the same thing expect different result so far we have see minimal fiscal adjustment at the statement and meanwhile the chancellor have manage to recreate the same constraining condition that exist beforehand this be situation entirely of the government own making it be the chancellor decision to choose these fiscal rule and it be her decision then to take measure that undermine economic growth she have stake her own credibility and that of the government on those decision the result be that we will now have endless uncertainty and avoidable speculation about the fiscal position every week through the comprehensive spending review and into the autumn budget the chancellor have refuse to rule out make more cut to spending even so she may have to impose tax rise and those tax rise could come even soon than anticipate if the us decide to go ahead with the tariff it have suggest as such my question be this what will the leader of the house feel in her own heart and what will she say to her cabinet colleague over the next few week as the full effect of these terribly damaging decision become clear join the right hon gentleman in say that it be really heartwarme to hear so many tribute pay to his father at last week business question such moment show the house at its good and thank he for bring his eulogy to the floor of the house also join he in look forward to mothering sunday maybe will get some rest on that day but we will see first will have to pay visit to my own mum who pay tribute to as well her very favourite phrase which have stick with throughout my life be they who do nowt do nowt wrong will leave that to linger with few colleague as the right hon gentleman say yesterday we hear the spring statement we hear that this labour government be take on the unprecedented long term challenge that this country face know that he and conservative members do not want to acknowledge it but be afraid that be the reality the problem that we face run deep there be huge global uncertainty as he know there have be year of under investment in infrastructure and in people lead to low productivity and low growth there be the effect of covid to which we be particularly expose and which his government do not address leave generation of working age adult consign to benefit and million young people not in education training or work and our economy remain in the long shadow of liz truss who destroy fiscal confidence leave high and costly debt high interest rate and ordinary people pay the price that be afraid be the legacy we be try to address we be face up to those reality and put this country on path to improved living standard secure work an nhs that be back on its foot affordable home to live in and security through defence and our global leadership that be go to take time there be no deny it but the forecast publish yesterday which the right hon gentleman take selective view of show the green shoot of recovery he might not want to hear it but as the obr say yesterday growth forecast after this year have be upgrade as result of our policy britain be now set to be the second fast grow economy in the this year and next year be glad that the shadow leader of the house be welcome the boost in capital investment after year and year of under investment and downward trajectory in capital spending by his government that have lead to another billion extra earmark for defence another billion more for affordable and social housing and transformation fund that will help reform our public service and deliver those well outcome after the right hon gentleman government leave million languish in the aftermath of covid that be what they do we have get plan to get people back to work and we be make sure that the welfare safety net be sustainable for the long term that be far cry be afraid from his government our plan include pay rise for the low earner come in next week the employment rights bill which we on the government benches be proud of will give dignity and security in work we have protection for the most in need and the big back to work programme in generation even in the long shadow of liz truss very long shadow which loom large over our fiscal credibility interest rate be come down inflation be now under control and stability be restore the shadow leader of the house ask about the headroom but gently remind he that the headroom that the chancellor set out yesterday be more than the headroom she inherit from her predecessor one of the most shocking aspect of what we inherit be the eye watering cost of service our enormous debt we now spend billion year servicing debt which be more than we spend on defence justice and the home office combine that be what we inherit from the conservatives even in the face of those challenge the labour chancellor announce yesterday that the government day to day spending will be go up above inflation each year for this forecast and that will help restore our public service and give support to those who need it most those be labour value in practice make different choice for this country in the interest of work people that be what labour value be all about refer the leader of the house to the public office standard bill well know as the hillsborough law which be how would like to refer to it she will know my history in what happen at hillsborough and subsequently with the independent panel report and the involvement have in the negotiation between ministers family and other from what we be hear it seem that we be approach similar situation where whitehall be find reason to find problem with the law rather than deliver it it be only when we have the intervention of the then home secretary alan johnson and then baroness may of maidenhead when she become home secretary that we get thing move again can ask the leader of the house to talk to her government colleague to ensure that the duty of candour parity of funding for family at inquest and other issue that we agree on will be include in that bill and that it will be publish soon thank my hon friend for raise this issue know of his long history with the hillsborough disaster indeed understand that he be there that day he and all the family affect want to see justice and they want to see the hillsborough law come into effect this government remain committed to bring forward legislation in that regard as we have say but we want to ensure that it reflect the full range of concern and experience of those affect and that be the most important thing with this legislation we remain committed to work with the family and all those affect to make sure as we work at pace on that piece of legislation that it meet their expectation we will be set out our next step shortly call the liberal democrat spokesperson the government welfare change announce in yesterday spring statement will see carer lose half billion pound of support by carer receive precious little support already so remove what little they get will do nothing to help people into work instead it will just put more pressure on already overstretch carer social care and as we all know the nhs these change come when the nhs be in state of flux and uncertainty integrated care board who run local health service have be tell to make eye watering cut of to their running cost but the government have not publish an impact assessment on these icb cut or set out what the effect will be on patient be we to assume that the government be do this in the dark should we assume perhaps that they be close their eye and hop for the good while in reality not have clue what it will mean for patient carer or people in their time of need surely if they have properly assess their proposal and it be all go to be fine they would waste no time in tell we the alternative of course be that the government know exactly how bad these cut will be and what they will mean for our struggle health and care service either way it be right that this house and the public should know what the government know about the impact of their plan will the leader of the house therefore grant government time to discuss the impact on our nhs of cut carer support and of their rush cut to integrate care board on carer allowance and the reform to welfare that have be set out to this house in number of statement and urgent question our guide principle be to ensure that the safety net be there for the most in need that there be well support for those who can work to get back into work and that our welfare system and payment such as personal independence payment and the associated carer allowance and other thing that sit alongside it be there for the long term frankly the situation as it stand today mean that aspect of that be not sustainable into the long term for example we be see more than thousand new people day be award personal independence payment and that be simply not sustainable however absolutely agree with the hon lady that such reform need to be do carefully with compassion and in manage way we need to consider all aspect especially in relation to what might be consider passporte benefit primary legislation will be come forward on these issue shortly so they will be fully debate on the floor of the house be sure that member will take time to consider those measure the hon lady raise some question about icb and the change we be make to the national health service and nhs england our intention and our aim be to get more money back into frontline service and have less be spend on

light at that time the uk have one of the bad paternity offer in europe and nowhere be that more apparent than in the police force where new research from the dad shift show that many frontline officer be take just one week of paternity leave because that be all they be entitle to on full pay do the leader of the house agree that when the government present their review of paternity leave to

cultural influence to transcend distance our town be all the well for it it be pleasure to follow the hon member for luton south and south bedfordshire rachel hopkins who speak so eloquently and passionately about the contribution of the irish diaspora particularly in luton south and south bedfordshire lot of south be be speak about today we be also talk about the south of ireland and its contribution to the success of our country the united kingdom it be pleasure to take part in the debate thank the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for secure debate on st patrick day and northern irish affair commend he for his year of support for british irish relation remember that when he be mayor of haringey he fly the irish flag for st patrick day and celebrate that important occasion in the borough and thank he for that st patrick day be great feast day when we come together as one great british family to celebrate saint patrick the patron saint of the island of ireland he be share by northern ireland and the republic of ireland that be an important point to make because some people think that st patrick be the patron saint purely of the republic of ireland but as my cross of st patrick cufflink show he be very much the patron saint of northern ireland too be also pleased to say that st patrick day be my birthday so it be special day for my family connection with ireland run deep on my mother side my great grandparent be dempseys and although be very english be proud of my irish ancestry as many of our ulster members know st patrick be great saint whom we should aim to emulate fundamentally this day remind we of figure who champion the christian faith steadfast believer who go from the mainland to ireland in order to cure the soul of native in his mission he be man of solemn sincerity keep his promise to god to convert the non believer he be also clearly man of great forgiveness and reconciliation because early in his life he have be enslave by the irish but he later go there with the mission of save their soul for eternity we can learn great deal from the life of st patrick there be many thing that we as nation could do to mark this important day and give it the gravita it deserve strongly submit that st patrick day should be national bank holiday alongside all the other feast day of our kingdom patron saint st george day on april st david day on march and st andrew day on november not only would that be firmly in line with the position of anglicanism as the unchallenged state religion but it would reinforce the importance of all four corner of our nation so too would the resurrection of the order of st patrick which be shamefully allow to fall into abeyance many decade ago but remain sovereign order of the united kingdom hope that the minister will give that idea serious consideration it would be wonderful if the royal order of st patrick be restore should his majesty decide to restore it for use in the united kingdom be sure that many people would be worthy of it include more widely irish people who have contribute to relation between our two nation the feast day of st patrick be not just about dress in green don shamrock and drink guinness feast day be about how we value the native people of these island and their heritage tradition and culture that must be reflect in all our great british tradition under one king and one flag indeed it be my view that the irish ulster scots and anglo irish be very much part of our family within the great british isles all the people of these island be deeply intertwine in every area of life from blood and history to literature and music and of course sport we be fundamentally inseparable and should not only embrace our historical connection but

will continue to work with colleague from all legislature and executive throughout british irish parliamentary assembly area to strengthen bond between the inseparable nation and territory of the british isles england scotland northern ireland wales the isle of man the bailiwick of jersey and the bailiwick of guernsey not forget alderney and sark today we must focus more on bring together the four home nation of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and on reverse the constitutional backsliding in the british internal market have great sympathy with the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister when it come to that area of policy despite that the inseparability of the mainland and northern ireland remain clear in so many facet of national life blood culture and king to name but few commend their majesties the king and queen for their outstandingly successful visit to ulster recently praise the good people of northern ireland for provide such heartening welcome and demonstration of local pride be sure that their majesties will treasure those memory for year to come the crown have also receive wonderful reception in the republic of ireland in recent year her late majesty queen elizabeth ii most notably visit dublin for state visit in and speak irish to the assemble dignitary that be characteristic example not only of her exemplary good humour and reconciliatory nature but also of the warmth and good will between all our people the republic of ireland be our friend but we can be much close and fully realise that we be in all sphere of national operation one family who share unique group of island indeed ireland could do much more work alongside her british brother and loyal northern neighbour in recognise that share heritage and advance the share value and goal on the global stage and emulate country such as australia canada and new zealand hope that one day perhaps soon the people of the republic of ireland might choose to take their rightful place in the family of the commonwealth of nations take our deep neighbourly relation to the next level to the benefit of both partner and believe have bounteous benefit for global politic also take this opportunity to send our greeting to the good people of the british overseas territory of montserrat who also celebrate st patrick day st patrick be also their patron saint and

talk about the weather they be talk about what they encounter when they go to try to rent property and see sign that say no black no irish no dog it be in the face of that kind of injustice that my parent form very strong link with irish friend they be all face with the same kind of discrimination and from that relationship grow we see that relationship in brent especially which have large west

very happy st patrick day it be chance for we all to recognise the history of our commonality and what make we human and to ensure that we continue to be unite as society the chamber seem empty without the hon member for strangford jim shannon but call the next good jim jim allister thank you madam deputy speaker since this debate be not just about st patrick day but about northern ireland affair be surprised that be the only member of the house from northern ireland participate in it that be pretty poor situation gently put it to the hon and learn member that he ought to correct himself slightly the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan be also from northern ireland number of colleague who represent northern irish constituency have send apology for have have to go home no doubt to tend to their constituent put it on the record that they have make that point know that the hon member for strangford jim shannon be in westminster hall this very minute he have double book himself as he would be aware that the hon member for strangford jim shannon be in residence at his second home be however the only member present who represent northern ireland constituency if that satisfy the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee of course st patrick be very important figure historically no doubt over the generation he have be even more greened than he ever be but do find it little rich in irony that st patrick be brit be celebrate with such enthusiasm by the irish think it be important in talk about st patrick to recognise and remember that his primary contribution be in bring the christian message the message that fallen man need reconciliation with god and that can come only through the mediation of the lord jesus christ that be his essential message to ireland and elsewhere it be also right of course that there be many intertwine relationship between the various part of ireland and the various part of great britain one can think of some of the standout indication of that not least in the currency of the second world war when the port of northern ireland be so vital to the battle in the atlantic and to defend our freedom indeed northern ireland welcome the first american soldier to be encamp and they run to many many thousand in those year at the same time sadly the republic of ireland hold to strategy of non involvement and neutrality therefore it be always right to remember that in great britain great hour of need the united kingdom great hour of need it be in fact the people and country of northern ireland who come swift to its aid whereas the government of the irish republic formally and quite shockingly express regret at the death of hitler it be from within northern ireland that the contribution be make that the then prime minister winston churchill so generously recognise of course the relationship be multifacete and it be easy to be cosy and sentimental about those relationship and there be place for that but do have to say to this house that there be also dark side to the relationship because the undoubted source for much of the initiation conduct and carry forward of the brutal ira terrorist campaign of the and be the aid and assistance give from the republic of ireland indeed the historical record show that the provisional ira be first arm by those associate with the irish republic even in government those be factor that represent constituent who lose family member at the hand of the ira can not easily forget and nor should we we talk about co operation and co operation be good but it be also salutary fact that at the peak of those terrorist campaign we do not have the co operation we need between and there be extradition application for want terrorist in respect of terrorist deed commit in northern application to the dublin authority and only one be grant of course the truth be that many of the cross border terrorist attack be carry out from the irish republic among they the most infamous that of the great loss of military life the attack at warrenpoint where the bomb that kill all those parachute regiment and other regiment soldier be trigger from the irish republic that be but reflection of what happen time and again when co operation be seek there might have be nice word but there be very little action as indicate in the matter of extradition so think we have to inject into our reflection upon that relationship some of the cold reality that cost the life of british citizen in northern ireland that can not not be write out of our history if we be to debate northern ireland affair properly it be surely impossible to ignore the incredible constitutional situation that northern ireland be now in namely that although stand in what be call the sovereign parliament of the united kingdom there be area of law pertain to northern ireland in relation to which neither this parliament nor the devolve parliament can make the law because those power cover much of our economy have be surrender to foreign parliament the european parliament in pursuit of that we now have the obscenity of an irish sea border shortly to be reinforce with the insult of parcel border granny can not send her new grandchild in northern ireland teddy bear without register it through the process of the irish sea border business in my constituency small engineering business or craft industry depend on supply that come by parcel from their age long supplier in gb but those parcel will now be subject to the demand of the foreign eu border those that send they must be member at cost of the trust trader scheme they must make custom declaration and they must record what be move where it come from and where it be go and yet this be say to be united kingdom it be united kingdom sadly partition by border in the irish sea the point be come to be that much of that be at the behest of the authority in the irish republic it be the taoiseach of the irish republic who push cajole and force the eu into its irrational demand at the beginning of the protocol negotiation the eu be prepare for indeed it originate the idea mutual enforcement to control the movement of good sadly it be taoiseach varadkar who see the opportunity of partition the united kingdom and who insist on the border be push to the irish sea where the ira could never push it in its year of terror it be the dublin government that make those irrational demand and repudiate the very thing that make that unnecessary namely mutual enforcement so yes there be lot of nice fuzzy sentiment about how the irish republic and the uk have good relation in many area but the reality be that there have also be malevolence to the detriment of northern ireland may be get on bit now but do not recall some of the accusation that the hon and learn member be make about the role of the irish government in the negotiation that follow the brexit vote will he clarify for the purpose of the record whether many unionist elect representative some of whom sit in this chamber encourage their supporter to vote for brexit in june do they not they do but they do not get brexit that be the fundamental issue the question on the ballot paper be do you want the united kingdom to leave it be not do you want gb to leave and to leave northern ireland behind but that be what we get we be leave in the single market under their custom code never forget that their custom code decree that gb be foreign third country so its good must pass through the eu border because northern ireland be treat as eu territory that be not on my ballot paper and that be not what vote for but that be what the last government leave we and that be what this government seem unprepared to do anything about even though it be not what they bring about so yes let we celebrate the international relation that we would expect between neighbour but let we not get so bleary eyed that we do not recognise the reality and the legacy of the history we be talk about the wonderful relationship with the irish republic but who be take the united kingdom to the european court of human rights it be the government of the irish republic over legacy act that this government be not even pursue in any relationship people look for two way co operation they certainly do not look to try to exploit situation to achieve the disassembly of part of the neighbouring country sadly that be what be happen in respect of the brexit negotiation call liam conlon to make the final back bench contribution congratulate my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee on secure the debate and on all his effort and leadership in champion the irish in britain and advocate for co operative relationship with northern

st patrick day refreshment but jameson be also available and tayto crisp be worth note tayto be more than crisp they be way of educate people about ireland and irish politic lot of people do not know that there be two type of tayto one from northern ireland and one from the republic of ireland or as call they the nordie tayto and the free stayto that be always good way of explain thing to people

constituency in london with gaelic place name as penge mean edge of the wood we have fantastic irish community all four of my grandparent be from ireland two granny from the south and two grandad from

sure that everyone know that her grandson have be elect as an mp couple of year ago there be an exhibition at the london irish centre curate by the national charity irish in britain that for the first time that can remember really tell the story of the london irish community over several generation the london irish do as much as any community to build this great city irish navvy dig the underground and irish construction worker rebuilt our city after the war know that we have fantastic construction industry in london with so many irish people involve and today we have the founder of and member from the london irish construction network include sean daly and frank here to watch the debate as be touch on by my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme wave of thousand of young irish woman come to staff our hospital at the birth of the nhs in this country those woman know as the angels of mercy be often overlook but essential to the nhs spend lot of time in nhs hospital as teenager especially the royal london hospital and the royal national orthopaedic hospital my irish dad would often look after and we would often encounter an irish nurse before could get treat they have to establish how they know each other it would begin with what county be you from then what town be you from do you know so and so once they have make that connection we be free to get on with our day the irish in britain have maintain that relationship with the nhs ever since and be really proud that there be more irish staff in the nhs today than staff from any other european country even if we think back more recently to the global health emergency of covid it be an irish woman professor teresa lambe who co develop the oxford astrazeneca vaccine it be then margaret keenan an irish woman from enniskillen live in coventry and former nhs nurse who become the first person in the world to have the vaccine the irish connection to the nhs be really deep and strong and our community be incredibly proud of it however the exhibition also chart the history of how the irish community be receive here which as have be touch on be not always easy alongside the windrush generation and the west indian community it be important to remember that there have be lot of solidarity between those community it be often treat with suspicion and subject to discrimination include through sign that read no black no dog no irish however the london irish community and the irish community across britain today be community transform it be confident in the contribution it make to every aspect of life

to and which do incredible work to support the irish community in reading as well as celebrate the contribution of the irish community in britain will touch on campaign start in the last few week to secure justice for survivor of ireland mother and baby home live in britain we often need to remember the reason why lot of people leave ireland and decide to come to britain for some it be for work or to be with friend and family but in the case of thousand of woman who be send to those home for the perceive sin of become pregnant outside marriage it be to escape those institution and the stigma that often come with have be in one more than survivor live in britain today both woman and the child who be bear into the institution they be subject to some of the most horrific mistreatment and abuse in those home woman be use as unpaid labour and their child be often forcibly adopt have name my bill philomena law after philomena lee who feel bring that story to global audience in the film philomena in which she be portray by dame judi dench we have an event on an evening two night ago in pack room in parliament to which survivor come and tell their story it be incredibly powerful to hear from they about the impact that that have on they many year later hope the government will listen to the proposal we be put forward at the moment if the survivor accept the compensation payment they have be award by the irish government but be in receipt of means test benefit they will lose that compensation hear from survivor this week and that have actually become an additional burden for many of these woman who be now often in their or and some of they be very vulnerable will go back to the irish in britain we see the pride of the second generation irish community of which be part and the growth of irish culture and its importance right across britain in the growth of the gaelic athletic association it be not just people of irish heritage who get involve but people from all

congratulate they they have name she fiadh which be irish for wild think she will take after her dad it be common that people be very proud of their heritage often several generation back we have see that in irish music and culture where for year the irish community be subject to discrimination we be now in period where we can turn on the tv on friday night and watch graham norton on bbc one and derry girls on channel which be representation of how far the irish community have come we see it in trade union and in the labour movement as well there be period year or two ago when the general secretary of every single major trade union in this country be either generation or second generation irish there be no more visible transformation in the confidence of the london irish community over time than in the growth of the mayor of london st patrick day parade be very proud to take part in that this month with our mayor sir sadiq khan more than people join and participate in that parade

special and sum up neatly the irish contribution to make our country the great place it be to live again thank my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme for secure this debate and thank everyone who have take part in it call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank other hon member and the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for what have be really lovely debate this be my first time participate in this debate and have be quite surprised by how genuinely lovely it have be and by the outpouring of love for the irish community both across these isle and in the republic of ireland that have be really lovely to hear be slightly concerned that we would get through the debate without mention anything about irish music so when the hon member for brent east dawn butler start talk about irish music be frankly relieve music be such big part of my life when be grow up discover irish music largely in bar in france over many many late night when live there for while it go on late or maybe early do not know it be or sometimes in the morning when it finish the sound of the fiddle and the joyful music be really amazing and have keep up that love of irish music thank ireland for give we that music and for make it so enjoyable be also slightly concerned because the debate be about northern irish affair as well as the wonderful thing about st patrick day also enjoy partake of some guinness the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister then speak up and start say something that want to say while there be some amazing thing about ireland and our relationship with it there be also thing that perhaps be not work quite as well as they could in debate about northern irish affair we should acknowledge that in that spirit without wish to take away from some of the loveliness of this debate have few thing to say along those line hope hon member will forgive but they be important to raise will start by talk about something very current it happen early on this week pay tribute to the police and to school for their swift and professional response to hoax that force nine school in northern ireland to close this week teacher parent and pupil can frankly do without the disruption and anxiety that such hoax cause they have other thing that they need to concentrate on the importance of education must never be underestimate so be glad that thing be able to return to normal quickly northern ireland do not vote to leave the european union some of its population want to stay yet the decision take by the conservative government in implement brexit have cause nothing but problem whether along the border inside stormont or with trade while northern ireland enjoy access to the united kingdom and the european union market the conservatives brexit deal botched deal be afraid have be disaster for the economy hit small business farmer and fisher particularly badly although we welcome the agreement of the windsor framework that deal be just stick plaster one that only exist to fix problem cause by the conservative party what be really need be something much more comprehensive and strong for northern ireland as for scotland wales and england close relationship with our european ally will bring nothing but positive but in our opinion the labour government be fail to take pragmatic approach to the uk relationship with the eu an easy step forward would be alignment on sanitary and phytosanitary standard and secure veterinary agreement which the liberal democrats be call for as part of our plan to fix what we believe be the uk break relationship with europe as such we call on the uk government to take the follow two step to use the provision within the uk eu trade agreement to secure veterinary agreement and to enshrine alignment with eu sps standard in domestic law the eu already have two veterinary agreement in place one with new zealand and one with switzerland such agreement be not particularly novel and certainly not impossible to achieve so it be difficult to understand what be hold the labour government back fix our relationship with europe be the most important way to boost our economy and accordingly provide funding to fix public service yet labour continue to rule out even simple step such as those have outline or indeed youth mobility scheme such scheme would not be return to free movement as the prime minister have suggest it would be way to support our young people to develop the skill and experience they need to help grow the uk economy as whole ulster university economic policy centre have publish report that look at what future skill employer will need and at the potential supply gap northern ireland need more than additional worker year in order to grow its economy so youth mobility scheme between the uk and the eu be the perfect way to fix that problem these proposal would go long way towards reduce the friction cause by the brexit deal in world in which the labour government talk endlessly about the tough choice they need to take youth mobility scheme feel like an open goal we just need labour to lace up its boot and kick the ball into it however we be also call on the government to negotiate new trade deal with the uk with new custom union at its heart which would tear down red tape and boost our economy boost the economy of both northern ireland and the whole of the uk mean more revenue to fix public service that desperately need fixing especially in the context of power sharing only have be restore just over year ago follow two year without function executive during cost of living crisis the liberal democrats four step road map provide path for the uk to rebuild its tie of trust and trade with our european neighbour ultimately liberal democrats want to see the uk back at the heart of europe once more set the agenda from within rather than battle the constraint from without turn to the welfare cut that be announce last week and deepen far yesterday it be hard to overstate how strongly oppose liberal democrat members be to those cut and importantly how concerned we be about what they mean practically for those impact we agree that we have to bring the welfare bill down and support more people into work it be right for people and for our economy but the emphasis should be on support people into work we will not achieve that by slash support for disabled people some of whom will never be able to work while other need the personal independence payment precisely so that they can continue to work these cut will have disproportionate impact on northern ireland and particularly on those still live with the legacy of the trouble include victim with catastrophic injury and those suffer from trauma relate mental health issue the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood have be highly vocal on this issue describe the cut as cruel and cowardly and highlight that balance the book should not come at the expense of the most vulnerable limit the eligibility of these people will do nothing to get more people into employment liberal democrats have long say that the good way to bring down benefit spending be to fix health and social care and fix it quickly that involve invest in preventive health measure by properly fund mental health support especially for young people and reform social care surely that should be the priority however when it come to healthcare reform in northern ireland the spanner in the work remain political instability since devolution begin in its most recent form year ago stormont have be without function government for almost of the time it have have prolong collapse in from to from to and most recently from to it be the people of northern ireland no matter what community they be from who bear the brunt of malfunction government this never end cycle prevent the transformative action that be necessary to get northern ireland public service and finance in order there be also the cost of maintain divide society estimate in to be at least million annually that cost stem from duplicate service additional policing and security expense and miss opportunity for investment and tourism those unnecessary cost be drain on the executive already stretch budget it would be far well to spend that money on improved healthcare ease the pressure cause by the cost of living and essential service early this year the hon member for lagan valley hold westminster hall debate on the reform of political institution in northern ireland in which she outline the way in which reform those institution will allow northern ireland to become more prosperous address the financial burden of division could unlock substantial funding for public service we echo her call for an update assessment of the societal and financial cost of division and commitment from all party to tackle those cost that would ensure that money be spend where it be need most and that we could deliver more inclusive united and integrated community for everyone northern ireland can not afford to keep pay for divide system in which essential service struggle in closing underline that the liberal democrats be entirely commit to fairness sustainability and share future for northern ireland we call for real action on welfare support movement back towards our european neighbour and focus on tackle division and addressing issue in political institution in order to boost public spending we on the liberal democrat benches have positive vision for more prosperous inclusive and forward look northern ireland vision that hope all member of this house will share regardless of their view about how to get there call the opposition spokesperson it have be an enormously enjoyable debate start by pay tribute to the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee from the perspective of conservative members he be one of depressingly large wave of new entrant into this place but he have definitely mark himself out as one to watch he produce tour de force wide range review of the historical community tie between the nation of the british isles the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan give we very interesting history of st patrick certainly learn more from his speech than be able to find in my wikipedia search in preparation for this debate that be an admission the hon member for luton south and south bedfordshire rachel hopkins who be think it be fair to say proud trade unionist and other labour members highlight the strong connection between people of irish descent and the trade union movement so though that movement have not all be good some of it have be my hon friend the member for romford andrew rosindell call with great force and in my submission quite rightly for bank holiday to celebrate st patrick if the hon member for newcastle under lyme put forward proposal to celebrate both st patrick day and st george day as bank holiday would be one of the first to support he my hon friend the member for romford also mention the now defunct order of st patrick and his campaign to reinstate it that sound like sensible thing to do he make reference to the green of st patrick from my research on wikipedia learn that st patrick colour be actually blue not green green be development of the most recent century so we might have to do bit of work there the hon member for brent east dawn butler celebrate boast about frankly have the large irish diaspora of any uk constituency she highlight as do other the huge contribution that

irish community he make an eloquent plea for support for his campaign on philomena law the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister rightly describe the significant contribution of northern ireland to this nation fight for freedom in the second world war but he go on to recognise some dark aspect of the relationship between northern ireland and the republic of ireland and of the east west relationship and do not think he be wrong to do that if we be to have mature relationship build on trust and respect we need to recognise each other weakness as well as be sentimental about our shared history we should be clear eyed and recognise the failing of other as well as ourselves in our shared history while do not agree with everything he say there be point when think yes you be

have go before she start of course with anthony steen as special adviser to the pre legislative scrutiny committee and to the home affairs committee and as the drive force behind the human trafficking foundation he have be ever present and omnipresent in this field he be very ably support by peter bone who set up the first all party parliamentary group on human trafficking and modern slavery which be now very proud to co chair with the noble baroness butler sloss another true legend in this area pay tribute to frank field who be wonderful advocate and with whom work so incredibly closely both as minister and as back bencher he lead parliamentary effort as the first chair of the speaker advisory committee on the modern slavery act and how we implement it here in parliament in addition pay tribute to the noble lord randall who support anthony steen and other and now chair the human trafficking foundation maria miller who work on the review of the modern slavery act along with baroness butler sloss and frank field lord coaker who chair the select committee before and my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith who through his social justice work be real advocate the final person want to pay tribute to who be so sadly no long with we be james brokenshire he be my predecessor as modern slavery minister and he really do start the work to get we to the point where we have modern slavery act can not quite believe that it be year ago think might be the only person in the chamber who be here at that time but march it be year ago to the day it be thursday be the very last day before parliament prorogue for the general election we have be work on the bill it have undergo every kind of proper scrutiny and be an exemplar for how legislation should be do pre legislative scrutiny draft bill and work do with the select committee and other it also have cross party support as be always the case with any comprehensive piece of propose legislation there be area where change be look at and there be quite lot of ping pong between this place and the other place as the minister spend far more time than ever expect stand at the bar and hop that by be there could convince their lordship to support the government position we have two real sticking point one be on the treatment of those in the united kingdom who be on an overseas domestic worker visa the other be whether every child victim should have an independent child trafficking advocate pay tribute to the noble lord bates who be the lords minister at that time his power of diplomacy and skill in navigate the other place be legendary he get we to the point at which we be the final piece of legislation to get royal assent in that parliament remember be in one of the office in marsham street where we all sit with bated breath although we know that we have get through it nobody quite believe it until la reyne le veult be finally announce and the modern slavery bill become an act of parliament as well as those parliamentarian pay tribute to all the official in the home office who work so hard it be real mission for they and it would not have be possible without an incredible team effort thank everybody who get we there it be unbelievable to that year on be still ask what be modern slavery sometimes feel slightly cross that still have to explain it but it be important that we keep reflect what it be it be slavery plain and simple we all understand what slavery be it be slavery happen today it be financial crime it be invariably for financial gain it be the exploitation of one human being by another human be for financial gain it be coercive crime and it be happen globally there be estimate to be million victim globally and more than victim here in the uk hate to say this madam deputy speaker but can assure you that it will be happen in your town village and city it will be round the corner happen to people you come across in your everyday life urge everybody who be listen and everybody who be here they be here because they care about this and be grateful to all of they to educate wherever they can one of the thing be proud of be the poster many member here will not see they because they be male in woman toilet at airport or station that say be you victim of slavery we come up with that in the home office because we realise that victim of slavery who be with the perpetrator in the queue at the immigration line at the airport have nowhere to go to get help apart from the lady lavatory where their perpetrator will not follow they as the minister will know the perpetrator be very often male although as we hear in our evidence session on tuesday in the home affairs committee there be always at least one woman on every indictment woman be perpetrator as well but we need to find somewhere to get those woman the support they need this be crime that be happen everywhere have to make the point that it be not migration crime there be laziness in the language use around trafficking particularly by medium commentator who talk about human trafficking when they mean people smuggling people smuggling be consensual crime those people be victim of crime but they be almost victim of fraud rather than be coerce into do something against their will it be very much like the difference between someone who get sick from take drug because their drink have be spike against their knowledge and someone who take illegal drug they have buy and be sick there be policy response to each of those case but it have to be different the policy response for victim of trafficking can not be confuse with the policy response for victim of the crime of people smuggle people smuggling be crime that we need to tackle and it be right that government control their border but we must separate the two that should be do at law enforcement level at the home office and at other policy department these two issue can not be confuse what do the act do have copy of it with it be the first time have look through the act for quite some time be get goosebump but also feel slightly nauseous at what we go through to get there be incredibly proud of it it introduce the new offence of trafficking and exploitation pay tribute to caroline haughey kc who come before the committee on tuesday and who help to write those offence the offence be very carefully draft to ensure we could get the maximum number of prosecution and they be write with view to jury be able to understand they there be push at the moment to change the traffic definition to not include movement the reason we have an exploitation offence and traffic offence be that jury will think of traffic as involve movement that be why there be also an exploitation offence that do not involve movement so that prosecutor can get successful prosecution be not sure that that change be necessary the maximum sentence for these offence be previously year but the act change that to life imprisonment which be really important move protection for victim have improve for example we introduce statutory defence to ensure that victim come forward which be incredibly important civil protection order be also introduce as be measure to enable law enforcement to more easily access the financial asset of perpetrator which also include reparation order this be do because the only way to break this crime be to break the business model there be also new duty on public agency the act introduce the independent anti slavery commissioner independent child trafficking advocate be include in the legislation although it take long time for we to get they there the other piece of landmark legislation be the transparency in supply chain measure in section this have not initially be in the bill for example it be not there when stand at that dispatch box and close the debate on second reading but it be introduce during the passage of the bill this be the measure that everybody want to see include importantly though it be not stand alone measure it be part of modern slavery strategy that have be publish the year before it be base on the four ps approach to tackle crime pursue prevent protect and prepare there be so much in the modern slavery strategy beyond what be in the legislation the legislation be landmark but it be only very small part of what be be do in when the modern slavery bill be enact it be world leading we be the first country to have consolidated modern slavery act the first country to have transparency in supply chain legislation and the first country that have this as priority for government but the world have move on as we all know criminal always move more quickly than the legislation when we introduce the legislation county line be not phenomenon although the offence in the act be very appropriate for the perpetrator of county line offence the protection for victim simply do not fit the crime that be perpetrate in county line the issue of small boat be not phenomenon it simply be not there when we introduce the act however do want to make it clear that there be very little evidence that the people travel on small boat be victim of trafficking this be see in the home affairs committee they be victim of the crime of people smuggling the problem be that the measure take to stop the small boat have chilling effect on those who be genuine victim of the coercive crime of human trafficking that can mean that they do not come forward and that they will not provide the evidence that be need to stop the perpetrator that make it hard to detect the crime and to give the protection to victim this be real opportunity for trafficker somebody may have pay the people smuggler to get they into the uk but when they get here they can not legitimately work and they can not find the support that they need they be also in debt and that indebtedness and the inability to work legally mean that they then become victim of trafficker but as have say that be not phenomenon we know of at the time orphanage trafficking be another issue it be global issue that we be only just get to term with in the united kingdom we do not feel that the issue have affect we but in reality more than million child who be not orphan be currently live in orphanage they be live in orphanage that have be set up to raise money they have tourist visit they and gap year student work there they be there for the financial gain of those who have set up these orphanage australia have lead the way in tackle that issue wish to pay tribute to senator linda reynolds who be stand down from the australian parliament in the next few day she have be real leader on this at the inter parliamentary union she have pass resolution that have be adopt hope the minister will look favourably on amendment that might bring forward to the crime and policing bill or to private member bill that try to get the issue of orphanage trafficking into our legislation the people who want to support the orphanage do so with the good of intention they want to help the poor child but this be actually fraud these child be not orphan more than million child from south east asia and south america have be take away from their family and be be use to raise money for fake organisation when we bring in the section measure on transparency in supply chain although california have such measure it be the first time that national government have introduce one quite deliberately it be light touch provision we have to prove that it would work and be effective but the time have come for it to be tighten be disappointed that on tuesday we be unable to pass the amendment on the use of uyghur labour in the supply chain for solar panel and so on the us have the uyghur forced labour prevention act and its hot good provision whereby item can not even enter the us market unless the importer can prove that there be no slavery in the supply chain urge the government to look at what we can do on similar measure because they would be simple win for the government that would improve the situation and make it clear that we do not stand for slavery we will not become green in our energy production on the back of the poor and those who be be exploit what be ask the minister today first when will we have new modern slavery strategy we desperately need one as the current one be year old will she commit to strengthen supply chain measure it have be big disappointment to that many queen speeches and king speeches have include promise of new modern slavery legislation on supply chain but it have never come forward will she commit to that have concern about the fair work agency in the new employment rights bill because it take the gangmasters and labour abuse authority and put it into new agency that will not sit underneath the home office vital work be do by the gangmasters licensing authority and then the glaa which be bring in for the right reason we all remember the morecambe bay cockle picker disaster we need to ensure that there be proper home office oversight of that agency and that it focus on abuse and exploitation not just on ensure that employment right be meet we can not continue with two class of victim as we have at the moment we need to ensure that everyone who be victim of modern slavery can access the support that they need could the minister review the national referral mechanism welcome the extra caseworker but day on average for decision be not good enough she and both know that urge she to do whatever she can and will support she every step of the way to make it clear that the national referral mechanism need to make those decision more quickly we hear great evidence about this on tuesday in the select committee the uk have duty to put victim front and centre of everything we do in response to this crime if we do not put the victim at the heart of our policy response and everything we do we will simply fail to address this issue but we also need to lead the global effort we do lead it and the time have come for we to get back there we be look at people be desperate for the uk to lead on this they know what we have do in the past and they desperately want we to do it again that mean work in multilateral organisation such as the united nations in particular we need to ensure that sustainable development goal be enact around the world will the minister make this issue one of those priority know the government have their mission and be sure that could squeeze it into safe street or something like that could find way to shoehorn this in but without that support and leadership from the very top this matter will not get the urgency it need it be the big human right abuse globally it be happen everywhere include in the uk let we be clear the high number of victim in the nrm be uk national it be not migration crime we need to ensure that it have the support and the thrust behind it with the leadership that know the minister can give it urge she to ensure that the whole of government do the same as the only female mp to be sanction by the chinese communist party for highlight uyghur slave labour in supply chain will join the right hon lady in pay close attention to the minister response congratulate the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley on secure the debate however do not thank she for give that familiar feeling of dread be discover that we often get it in this place when the speaker immediately before make almost identical point to those have intend to make perhaps my speech will now be little short draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and to my position as chair of the all party parliamentary group on uyghurs we be have this debate towards the end of the holy month of ramadan across the uyghur region uyghurs will be imprison for observe the fast when they be imprison they will be force to eat often to eat pork and they will be force to drink alcohol where once they might have gather for iftar in mosque they will find those holy place be now pile of rubble have lose count of the number of time have speak in the house about the crime against humanity that be take place in the uyghur region but the right hon lady make the really important point that those crime against humanity exist alongside framework of financial crime uyghur suffer because their suffering be profitable of course there be an ideological element and religious element to it but it make the chinese regime lot of money so when we see woman be sterilise and rap child be steal and million of people in labour camp we can never separate that from the mass slave labour that be go on early this week in the chamber we be discuss the role of uyghur slave labour in the green energy sector but it be really important to note that it be far from limited to that sector we speak lot about the proportion of solar raw material infect by uyghur slave labour but that be also true of electric vehicle and cotton we all remember the remarkable scene recently at the business and trade committee when shein be simply unable to give convincing answer about whether its product contain slave labour material from the uyghur region it be also increasingly clear that the agricultural sector be expose to this particularly in tomato and pepper we see household name such as kraft heinz nestlé and implicate in the use of agricultural product from xinjiang that we believe have be make with forced labour this week debate about solar energy and slave labour have sense of déjà vu for many of we who have be work on uyghur slave labour for long time we can look back to the health and care bill under the last government and how they be under similar pressure we will continue to have this debate every time issue of public procurement be raise in the house until we fix our modern slavery legislation as the right hon lady be talk about the legislation be think of how it be similar to year ago it be fresh and perhaps thing of beauty but now it be tired and show its age interruption thank the house for the noes there that be reassuring we have to update the modern slavery legislation not least because much of the rest of the world ironically inspire by what we do year ago have move to update its protection against slave labour good the right hon lady mention the uyghur forced labor prevention act in the united states and the due diligence directive and force labour regulation in the eu on forced labour good come into the uk the modern slavery act be simply not design to deal with that issue the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands speak about the thing that have change in the last decade few of we would have imagine that industrial slavery involve million of people think to be relic of the or early century would have become so prevalent in the experience of uyghur muslims neither would we have envisage how difficult it would become in xinjiang to do any sort of due diligence that be what lead many of we to the argument that there must be presumption that good from that part of the world have involve modern slavery because of the uyghurs we know the modern slavery act be not work almost every day cargo flight arrive into this country from ürümqi the ground zero of slave labour for uyghurs section require company with turnover of more than million to produce statement on slave labour look back at the last year and see one in company choose not to do that without consequence it be clear that one of the act major failing be the lack of penalty also want to talk about justice we know that the worker who be exploit in place such as xinjiang will not find justice in their own jurisdiction under the modern slavery act neither can they get it here it be time to say that if company operate in the uk and be implicate in such human right abuse within its supply chain there should be an opening for the victim of that to seek justice in the uk court for those who have try to do that in other case some of which be live so will not raise they it have take year and real legal struggle to get they hear in order to be disincentive for company do the wrong thing that need to be make easy as we be talk about the behaviour of company that operate in the uk after the behaviour of shein and the spectacle of the evidence give to the business and trade committee allow that company to register on the stock exchange here would be unthinkable it would send signal that this be an economy that be willing to be base on the competitive advantage that come from not pay worker on the subject of justice want to mention the organisation hope for justice and particularly my constituent euan fraser who have be source of real help and advice to since be elect he make the point that back in when the government do their last study of the economic and social impact of modern slavery in the uk it be cost at billion might the minister be able to refresh that and give we new insight will she also be willing to meet hope for justice to discuss its proposal for independent modern slavery advocate they be individual who can work with survivor and ensure that their legal entitlement be realise not just on thing such as get justice on slavery but on housing immigration and importantly compensation so there be more of disincentive for company to conclude as the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands say we be try to rebuild the british economy but we can not do that at the cost of be complicit in the destruction of an entire people on this anniversary it be high time to modernise the modern slavery act thank the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley for secure this important debate as member we be all unite by our desire to do as much as we can to tackle the scourge of modern slavery my constituency be know for many thing but perhaps less well know for its connection to one of the great battle for human dignity the abolition of slavery more than year ago william wilberforce champion for the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade live in wimbledon just as wilberforce reject inhumanity in his time we must renew our commitment to eradicate that injustice in ours and though his effort be huge we stand here on the anniversary of the modern slavery act aware that the fight be far from over whether in the form of human trafficking domestic servitude or criminal forced or sexual labour modern slavery pervade our society treat people as commodity for criminal gain the introduction of the modern slavery act in be watershed moment hail as innovative and world lead echo the uk leadership in abolish the transatlantic slave trade in the century the act be design to protect victim prosecute offender and prevent exploitation at its root of the nearly million people around the world estimate to be trap in modern slavery some of they be think to be resident in the uk in over potential victim of modern slavery be refer to the home office through the national referral mechanism increase on the previous year horrifyingly of all referral last year be child the act introduce several key measure include section to establish the role of the independent anti slavery commissioner to encourage good practice in the prevention detection investigation and prosecution of modern slavery and to support victim however for staggering month through and while we have three conservative prime ministers we have no anti slavery commissioner during that time engagement between the modern slavery unit and key non governmental organisation decline the government ministerial strategy group once critical to tackle modern slavery be disband it be for that reason that the lib dems advocate for parliament to have power to appoint an independent anti slavery commissioner should the post remain unfilled for three month we need to do more than simply ensure that the commissioner role be not leave vacant challenge persist in the effectiveness of the commissioner due to inadequate resource and limited capacity despite the current commissioner effort since inherit dormant office the department remain underfunded and resource without appropriate funding and resource the commissioner ability to fulfil their legal obligation be clearly compromise the modern slavery act be praise for introduce provision aim at great transparency in supply chain with the goal of protect worker and compelling large commercial organisation to eliminate modern slavery from their operation section require company supply good or service and operate in the uk with turnover of million or more to produce an annual slavery and human trafficking statement though welcome section only mandate business to report on their effort to address force labour in supply chain it do not require they to act in fact simply report no action seem to be all they need to do to comply with the act despite the secretary of state authority to seek injunction on non compliant organisation none have be issue in of eligible organisation fail to submit modern slavery statement additionally the number of statement record the following year drop by almost indicate that business be deprioritise compliance while previous government have express their intention to strengthen section by introduce mandatory reporting requirement and specific penalty for non compliance no change have be implement to date too often victim be hide in plain sight it be sober to think that many of we may have encounter they without even realise recently for example the care sector have become focal point for modern slavery the inclusion of care worker and home carer on the shortage occupation list make they eligible for the health and care visa from to the number of health and care visa grant skyrocket reflect the sector increase reliance on foreign worker but alongside that growth come disturbing increase in exploitation with over more care sector modern slavery case report evidence give to the modern slavery act committee last year report that by the end of an alarming of the nhs supplier be identify as be at high risk of modern slavery the type of exploitation vary but one common theme be the charging of illegal recruitment fee victim be often force to pay as much as for visa application and suppose training course amount so large that worker often have no choice but to stay trapped in abusive condition the care sector continue to grapple with systemic issue include low pay and poor working condition which be exacerbate by fragmented regulatory oversight spread across agency such as the care quality commission and the employment agency standards inspectorate that lack of co ordination hamper effective enforcement the gangmasters and labour abuse authority hold modern slavery investigation power in england and wales and receive referral from the cqc but its remit do not specifically cover the care sector despite prioritise the sector the gangmasters and labour abuse authority struggle with insufficient funding and low inspector to worker ratio and fall below international standard as result proactive inspection be rare while many worker fear potential reprisal from report exploitation the report of the former special representative of the organisation for security and co operation in europe highlight the gangmasters and labour abuse authority effectiveness in prevent and investigate labour exploitation and protect vulnerable worker but stress its need for great financial support to fully realise its capacity the liberal democrats have consistently call for powerful new worker protection enforcement authority to safeguard those in precarious work through intelligence lead enforcement and firewall that separate labour standard enforcement from border control the uk current immigration system exacerbate the vulnerability of migrant worker the previous home affairs select committee describe de prioritisation of human trafficking in favour of attention on irregular migration under the policy of the previous conservative government warmly acknowledge the fact that the border security asylum and immigration bill seek to repeal many of the modern slavery provision of the illegal migration act will conclude where begin today we inherit not only wilberforce legacy but his responsibility modern slavery may adopt new form but its cruelty remain the same it thrive in the shadow of all our community in the exploitation of the vulnerable and in the complacency of indifference let we pledge not only to celebrate how far we have come but to redouble our effort as there be still far to go for in remember wilberforce endeavour we must find the courage to shape future in which his campaign to entirely abolish slavery finally achieve its aim as child be teach that year ago we abolish the transatlantic slave trade as young adult learn that that have not mark the end and that modern slavery be booming global industry then as become young father learn through the excellent work of hope for justice that there be slave right here in the uk hide even within my own city and learn that many of those slave be child not unlike my own feel hint of the desperation that would feel if one of my child have be traffic into slavery how would pray that there would be someone to rescue they someone who would not rest until slave have be find and release realise that for somebody else child have to be that someone fortunately be not alone and year ago this place once again pass legislation to end slavery in our nation it recognise our duty to eliminate slavery from our supply chain and it introduce key revelation to police that someone present as perpetrator might in reality be victim the world have continue to change however our protection have weaken and the challenge have grow it be estimate that there be victim of modern slavery in the uk yet few than be refer to the national referral mechanism last year detect modern slavery be hard it be crime in which the victim be intrinsically hide often as invisible and elusive as the perpetrator the police challenge be unique furthermore victim of modern slavery be often force to break the law or be camouflage among legitimate yet exploit worker who be themselves insecure transient and unrepresented we be combat highly organised and effective international criminal network they be agile opportunistic and embed in our community our system be vulnerable it have be too easy for child to disappear siloed public service be too ineffective in recognise and respond to potential case our system be divide and the trafficker have conquer yet there be hope once local authority be train in what to look for they begin to identify victim and work with partner can disrupt this crime if we ensure clearly define and resource role and be empower to work across multiple organisation and department we can ensure that these complex crime which intersect multiple agency can be detect we can ensure that victim become survivor and that perpetrator be convict we need to work across government to deliver that to eliminate slavery we must no long tolerate exploitation of any kind this government have take great step in improve worker right and that must continue we must be responsive and fast keep up with the high international standard in law and human right the council of europe convention on action against trafficking in human being provide framework that could be adopt broadly similarly we must ensure that the requirement for business to audit their supply chain have tooth the modern slavery act require large business to publish detail of the action that they be take to identify and tackle exploitation in their supply chain we now need check and penalty for failure to effectively keep supply chain free from slavery like survivor of stalk domestic abuse and sexual abuse survivor of modern slavery need access to independent advocacy we must embed that in our national response together with long term holistic support that be crucial both for survivor recovery and to reduce vulnerability to further harm or re exploitation we can not treat this problem as business as usual the world be become increasingly unstable and unpredictable international conflict and climate pressure be make people vulnerable and provide the perfect condition for trafficker that be visible in the english channel but that be just the tip of the iceberg what be hide be the ten of thousand of victim live in the fear and despair of slavery right here in our town city and rural area we be take firm and decisive action to protect our border break criminal gang and clear the backlog of immigration case recognise the point that the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley make about the distinction between people smuggle and human trafficking but the sector overlap the action be take be good start and recognise the impressive impact that the minister and our new government have already have through our investment in hire an additional modern slavery case worker but that be smash the iceberg only above the surface to solve the problem we need response that match the scale of the hide challenge modern slavery be complex crime that cut across all aspect of government and society and our response must match it cut across the whole of government put it to this house that we may already have golden opportunity this government have already commit to fresh approach to governing one of collaboration partnership and agility we be also undertake historic and ambitious programme of local government reorganisation and devolution of power from westminster to our region we have already see programme test and prove that provide model that we can deploy through local government the human trafficking foundation have work with nine local authority that have appoint designate modern slavery co ordinator those co ordinator have deploy training in local authority improve partnership work increase the quality and quantity of referral to support and deliver prevention strategy the work of these modern slavery co ordinator have be remarkable appreciate the hon gentleman give way be intervene on he so that can put it on the record that be trustee of the human trafficking foundation realise that do not say that in my opening statement but want to be clear about it and to say that support all the work that the foundation do thank the right hon lady for that clarification in there be local authority that make referral use the national referral mechanism for adult the nine authority with designate modern slavery co ordinator position account for of those referral that figure rise to in they train thousand of local authority staff and partner and increase confidence rate in report modern slavery from around to close to critically these measure lead to prosecution we can learn from that and devolution be ripe opportunity to deploy the lesson it be clear to that the government can no long delegate responsibility for modern slavery to single department we need to build both passive and active immunity into every area our modern slavery response must saturate our work at both national and local level alongside that collective duty dedicated role with cross organisational link and clear ownership be key national strategy that factor in local partnership response would be transformative an example of this can be see in the devolve decision make pilot in which multi agency team lead by local authority make national referral mechanism decision for child this approach be over four time fast than the home office at make decision and it encourage information sharing across agency and local partnership work to keep child safe the success of devolve decision make panel demonstrate the effectiveness of co ordinate local effort under national framework welcome the minister commitment in the recently publish action plan to roll out these panel local authority already have duty to disrupt modern slavery with clear cross cut partnership approach facilitate by clear dedicated local leadership we could start to build real immunity into our community we have embrace the mission to deliver decade of national renewal decade of the modern slavery act have allow we to begin the abolition of modern slavery we have the tool but we must not rest rather we should recommit ourselves to the most ambitious goal of end slavery in our nation and our supply chain we can see what need to be do we have begin now we must deliver the collaboration commitment and resource to do it there be people in our country who be utterly hide isolate fearful and hopeless but they be not alone today urge all in this house to recommit with we will not rest but will instead forge on and will do what it take and what the evidence have teach we to do in order to find slavery out prosecute the perpetrator break the network and march on until every person be see and slavery be finish warmly welcome this debate thank the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley for secure it and open it and for her work on this topic as we have hear from member from all part of the house while there be something to celebrate in the fact that this legislation be here there be still much more work to be do to achieve the goal of eliminate slavery entirely will take this opportunity to raise two issue with the minister issue on which there be work to be do that could strengthen our action on modern slavery and our policy the first issue relate to check and balance or review process in any administrative decision make process it be really important that there be opportunity for decision to be review by people with expertise yet in december the then home secretary the right hon and learn member for fareham and waterlooville suella braverman disband the multi agency assurance panel which play crucial role they bring together people with expertise in policy and in tackle modern slavery to review case in which applicant have be reject in order to ensure that the decision in those case be sound member from across the house may have receive the same briefing as from coalition of dozen of organisation work on modern slavery be shocked and surprised to read in that briefing that of reconsidered negative decision be overturn so there be clearly an issue with the decision make process and clearly vital role for review mechanism such as the multi agency assurance panel in check that decision be sound would very much welcome the minister respond to this point in she sum up and perhaps say whether the government will consider reinstate those important panel my second point be about the vulnerability of people on temporary work visa to labour exploitation prevent labour exploitation in the first place be key this issue relate particularly to people on overseas domestic worker visa but it also apply as the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler say to those in the care sector which be grow and to agricultural seasonal worker the core of this problem be that when the temporary work visa be attach to the employer there be strong disincentive for the employee to speak out and report labour exploitation because they will suffer punishment for do so that mean that the problem remain hidden and it make it much more difficult for people to come forward sensible reform that could tackle the problem have be propose by those work in the sector for instance if those work visa be renewable so long as the employment continue the individual would have degree of security however that would have to go alongside provision under which if the employer be subject to an enforcement mechanism for exploitation the employee be able to remain here and could seek alternative employment and an alternative sponsor for their visa understand that that be be do in australia where there be now mechanism for bridge visa to be provide that ensure measure of justice in the system and that those who be subject to exploitation can escape it and find new employment with non exploitative employer those be the two issue that want to bring to the minister attention look forward to hear her response thank the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley for secure the debate know she be great champion for these issue the global slavery index estimate that people be live in condition of slavery in the uk and over victim be refer to the national referral mechanism in the last year alone my constituency of congleton be absolutely beautiful and most of it have low crime rate by national standard but this problem be so widespread that it will be occur in my constituency because it be occur everywhere the figure of people be significant that be roughly one and half time the number of people in my constituency we often talk in this chamber about violence against woman and girl that subject be extremely important and will talk about it in the context of modern slavery but of those who be refer to the national referral mechanism last year be man the people most common refer be uk national child constitute about of referral in of those case the referral be for criminal exploitation and about of those refer be boy it be crucial that we keep up the pressure to reduce and remove violence against woman and girl but it be critical that we be aware of how much violence there still be in society against boy and man there be lot of different way in which modern slavery occur in the uk and its diversity make it more difficult to tackle for man it often occur in the agricultural and building sector and in takeaway the growth in the takeaway sector in the uk mean that large number of takeaway be operate from warehouse where the worker be completely unseen many of they be earn incredibly little if people can order takeaway for less money than it would cost to cook the same meal at home the chance be that that have come about through modern slavery my hon friend be make an important point about industry such as takeaway be site of modern slavery in my local council east lothian there have be pilot scheme look specifically at the takeaway industry and at what regulation local authority can put in place to allow they to enter premise to see what kind of modern slavery be take place it be an interesting pilot and want to draw her attention and the attention of the house to it thank my hon friend for draw that to my attention be very interested to hear about it be pleased to report that the overwhelming majority of takeaway in my constituency remain physical premise that also operate as restaurant but be aware that that be not necessarily the case in the whole of my local authority area and certainly not across the whole country be shock when find out about the large number of child especially boy who be be refer and about what be happen often old gang member find vulnerable young boy some as young as or and ask they to look after some drug for they for little you just hold they for very briefly those gang member will then arrange for those boy to be viciously beat up those boy will then be tell that they have lose the drug and now owe the gang member whole load of money and they will be put to work as county line drug dealer from an incredibly young age it be an absolutely horrific mean of exploit young boy particularly vulnerable child and we need to be as aware of it as we be of the way in which groom gang operate around girl will move on to how this issue particularly affect woman and girl will say one thing really really wish that man it be predominantly man would stop use prostitute could they just stop the number of woman be bring to the uk under false pretence and believe that they will do different form of work then be put to sex work against their will keep in physically confine situation that they be not allow to leave and have their passport take away from they be really significant the other thing that happen be that some woman come here know that that might be an element of their work if they then complain about it or want to stop they be tell that their child back home will be harm if they do so they be unable to go to the police when they be be systematically rap say to man please please stop use prostitute know that cheshire police be take all these issue very seriously and do their good but the good way to stop we have market for criminal activity be for people to stop buy criminally trade good whether that be vape tobacco drug or woman the final element of human trafficking will talk about be in the care sector many people in the chamber have hear talk about this topic before so do not want to labour it but the gangmasters and labour abuse authority licensing scheme do not extend to the care sector so agency and sponsor be seize opportunity to exploit other people for their own financial gain lot of people in my community receive care pay for either by the local authority and therefore by the taxpayer ultimately or with people life saving they would be absolutely horrified if they realise the number of people do that work who have be traffic here in the first place other hon member have mention the various organisation work in this area one of which be unseen which talk about regularly speak on its helpline to member of the care profession who have pay somewhere between and to get here when they should not be pay anything other than their own travel expense some of victim have be threaten with either direct personal harm or harm to their family member actual physical harm be report in of the case that come to that helpline nearly half of victim describe confinement or restricted movement the list of thing that have go on be genuinely absolutely horrendous suggest that when the fair work agency take over the glaa responsibility we ensure that licensing be bring into this sector or otherwise look at how the visa regime can be change so that people can transfer between employer and how we can generally stamp out the level of exploitation in the care sector thank everyone who have participate in this debate know there be lot of strong feeling across the house that we can and should do lot well for vulnerable people in this country pay tribute to the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley both for secure this debate and for her legacy in this field as the chair of the home affairs committee her ongoing commitment to the issue be palpable and look forward to work with she on it in the year ahead we be year on from the modern slavery act while be not in the habit of praise the home office under the previous conservative government be not so nakedly partisan that can not break that habit on this occasion it be true that the uk modern slavery act be world lead its scottish counterpart the human trafficking and exploitation scotland act which be also year old this year be equally groundbreake while we recognise that we must also admit that although the act take we two step forward we have undoubtedly go one step back the term modern slavery and human trafficking strike fear into our heart and capture our attention they sound like the stuff of tv drama and frequently they do involve the most horrific vivid crime in society and the bad of humanity but we must not let that fool we into think that modern slavery only happen at the extreme or only in the big metropolitan city far from we it happen everywhere in every community and every constituency as we have hear from several hon member today it affect man as well as woman its victim be child as well as adult it affect british people as much as foreign national and indeed more than foreign national and it be labour exploitation as much as it be sexual exploitation on my hon friend point about modern slavery happen everywhere carlisle be the most northerly city in england on october officer from cumbria police the national crime agency and investigator from the gangmasters and labour abuse authority free man who have be keep in captivity on the outskirt of carlisle for year he be vulnerable because of his learning disability and have variously keep in horse box and in disused caravan when he be find he be in damp rotten garden shed with neither heating nor lighting the window do not close the water pour through the door and his makeshift bed be congeal with vomit do my hon friend agree that the fact that someone could be keep in such circumstance for year on the outskirt of one of england city should shame we all and that we should recommit ourselves to ensure that every single person who might still be in that circumstance be find and free in the same way that that gentleman be thank my hon friend for make that really important point remember read about that case it be one of the most horrific one but there be so many horrific case of modern slavery it be take place on every high street in britain and we have to be completely vigilant about find it everywhere today want to talk about the public policy response to this appalling crime obviously it be dramatic wicked crime we have the blandly name national referral mechanism as our tool and to be honest that tool be currently all but break down in the word of the home secretary when she come to the home affairs committee before christmas the nrm have become bit stuck there be huge delay in victim get decision on the national referral mechanism we hear evidence this week that the mean waiting time be day that be beyond unacceptable it be systemic dysfunction to be clear that be not just number it have real cost the real world implication of that number be re traffic woman who be traffic for sex and then come to the state for help end up back in the hand of their trafficker because of our delay child who be lock in house and force to farm cannabis in appalling condition who then manage to escape and come to we for help end up back with their torturer because of our sheer incompetence we should not be congratulate ourselves today on the passage of historic legislation we should be hang our head in shame at what be happen on our watch hope that today the minister will set out clear plan to clear the backlog and will also recognise that do so will not be some huge step of progress but will just get we back to the baseline that we should be at draw the house attention to the child trafficking pilot that have be run for the past five year be so glad that my hon friend the member for worcester tom collins refer to it should probably declare an interest as be involve in set up its scottish iteration but it be worth our attention because it have devolve decision making in the nrm to panel of local stakeholder people from social work and from education the police psychologist and other who know the child case and empower they to adjudicate whether that child be victim of traffic or not it have be extremely successful with decision take more quickly and with high quality because the people who know that child case be well place to make decision than an official in whitehall before come here work on prevent human trafficking for five year know that the issue be complex and difficult but also encounter some of the most effective public servant have ever see in my time such as the trafficking awareness raising alliance in glasgow lead by bronagh andrew which care for woman traffic into scotland for commercial sexual exploitation and joy gillespie who advocate for survivor of trafficking in scotland the most impressive programme have see in five year of anti trafficking be this pilot in glasgow the minister and have correspond on the pilot previously and strongly encourage the government to look at roll it out more broadly make two final point about the step that the new government be take on modern slavery first on labour exploitation the employment rights bill landmark piece of legislation that could not be prouder to support scrap the gangmasters and labour abuse authority and establish the fair work agency as many have say that be all to the good but the fair work agency have mammoth task enforce the minimum wage and employment right across the whole workforce be we sure it will have the focus and resource to tackle modern slavery too will it have the right relationship with the police because that will be critical to ensure enforcement we must remember that this crime be everywhere and in every community moreover when the fwa be up and run the home office will lose sponsorship of the glaa and the responsibility will be subsume into the department for business and trade be that the right place for modern slavery responsibility from my experience remember the glaa be significantly under resource in order to inspect all of scotland fishery agriculture and farming it have only one inspector that clearly be not enough will we have more now what plan do the government have in place to ensure that modern slavery be not deprioritise secondly on the panoply of new development that we have have as the new government have hit the ground run there have be some that have be particularly pleased to see not only be there the new fair work agency but cuckooing will be make specific offence grooming will be an aggravating factor in child sex offender prosecution and range of new measure will be introduce to halve violence against woman and girl could not welcome those step more but be there coherent strategy to ensure they be be fully deploy to tackle modern slavery be we marshal the power of government to target these new measure at the perpetrator of these crime when can we expect to see that robust modern slavery strategy ask that because this issue need ministerial grip without clear ministerial direction law enforcement can not put resource into it without law enforcement prioritise the resource there be no investigation without investigation there be no justice we should think of the woman who come to the british state and ask for help only for our administrative incompetence to mean she be back in the hand of her trafficker be pimp out to be rap multiple time every day we have fail she once already we need strategy to ensure that we do not do so again will that modern slavery strategy take account of new development in modern slavery in the last year be pleased that the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler and other mention the exploitation of visa in the care sector but we be also see that with student visa the eu settlement scheme and elsewhere will the new white paper on legal migration be fully modern slavery proof so that we do not allow new route to open up note that the scottish government have finally get around to refresh their human trafficking strategy would argue that be long overdue step but it be also good opportunity to ensure we get coherence across the whole uk as we mark year since the modern slavery act be pass it be clear we still have our work cut out for we for one be willing to work with anyone inside or outside this chamber to get it do it be an honour to follow the hon member who have speak today all of whom have give such powerful speech just two day ago it be year since william wilberforce cajole this parliament into lead the way on combat slavery the abolition of slave trade act be pass to standing ovation on march the act make it illegal to trade and enslave people across the then british empire twenty six year later another groundbreake piece of legislation the slavery abolition act end the use of enslave labour however slavery clearly do not stop which be why we be talk about it today modern slavery be just that modern version of the slavery we have always know slavery be right here right now it do not belong to the distant past or to far away country as we have hear the majority of the people refer to the national referral mechanism be british and they be often man or boy as parliament we have to recommit to tackle slavery as we have hear modern slavery have spread its tentacle into so many aspect of our life it be estimate that there be million victim of modern slavery worldwide include in our country the size of the population of blackpool or cambridge so we have to renew our leadership to tackle modern slavery in my own constituency of bournemouth east there will be woman work in nail bar who be enslave there will be man work on build site who be enslave there will be mostly woman work in people home as domestic slave and there will be many other type of servitude go on the figure that be report be the tip of the iceberg these people be hide in plain sight and we need to get the message out that modern slavery be priority of this government this parliament and this country in my professional life before become an mp support victim of modern slavery by find they and get they to safety quickly be the chair of an anti slavery network for five year and lead mental health domestic abuse and homelessness charity that have run modern slavery service it pioneer an independent trauma advisory role that get support to around victim and survivor of modern slavery work alongside fantastic colleague on report into the nature and extent of modern slavery in oxford which use an interesting methodology beyond the typical reporting of stat from the police force it work in case base way with provider of support and find that modern slavery crime be record in the thames valley area in the five year period that the report look at however after draw in the voluntary sector there be believe to be between and case of modern slavery show that what be report be not always true reflection of what be happen and that our third sector organisation and network be so important in try to tackle modern slavery and support victim it be worth say that the need to tackle modern slavery have never be great although this anniversary mark decade since the modern slavery act it be also the case that we have see decade or more of austerity say that because some of the people who be enslave will have grow up under austerity and see their sure start centre and youth centre cut they will have see their school be able to provide less and less and see insecure work low pay and zero hour contract for their parent they will be live in home that have not be properly regulate they have grow up with significant vulnerability when people grow up with significant vulnerability they be so susceptible to enslavement have see it with my own eye give the government agenda on renter reform reform employment right and make sure that we have investment in our public service my hope be that we will repair the fabric of society and our public service so that no young person have to fall victim to modern slavery in my own part of the country we have see the number of case report to dorset police go up over the last nine year there be in and in so we clearly need to take action with your permission madam deputy speaker will bring the voice of modern slavery victim into this debate want to talk about three case in which my office have support victim in one case person be identify as potential victim of human trafficking and enter into the national referral mechanism my hon friend the member for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray say that it be quite bland name for bland service and he could not have describe it well the nrm be break and need serious reform this individual case have be give reasonable ground decision but they be still await conclusive ground decision it be no wonder give that we have such long wait for decision do my hon friend agree that we need to extend the time limit for challenge reasonable ground decision that limit have be reduce to day which be not long enough to get help from legal aid lawyer give the lack of legal aid funding my hon friend make very good point particularly in the short term as the government be work so hard to get grip on that delay that could be really helpful temporary measure to remove some of the anxiety of victim and some of the difficulty that support service encounter in try to get more and appropriate support for victim the individual be just talk about be promise that they would be able to work but they be instead force to arrive on visitor visa after three month in the uk they become homeless and experience severe mental health issue include depression anxiety and suicidal thought for which they be currently receive medication they owe large sum of money with interest to the agent who facilitate their travel to the uk and the agent have warn they not to return home they have claim asylum in the uk but it be life in limbo in second case former constituent be traffic into the uk while pregnant for forced prostitution she have now be recognise as victim of modern slavery and grant asylum in third and final case another female constituent ask for help in seek accommodation follow her escape from an abusive marriage she have be receive support from the liberty project run by the bournemouth churches housing association which provide shelter for woman escape modern slavery in my constituency why have mention these three people it be not merely because their voice deserve to be hear in this parliament but because all of we as mp have have contact with victim and survivor of modern slavery all of we know from first hand experience about the pressure and difficulty in the system and we bring that into how we try to improve the system think that be important for the public to know because do not think they often know about the casework aspect of what we do and how it be so important in inform what we do when bring forward legislative change mention the liberty project run by bcha which be fantastic organisation work across bournemouth christchurch and poole it provide safe house accommodation and frontline support to potential survivor through their reflection and recovery period and here want to make plea to the minister bcha like so many organisation provide trauma inform person centre approach it be so critical for such organisation to have the fund they need to walk alongside victim who have go through the bad experience of their life so that they do not have requirement to tick box but can sit and listen to people and work with they to recover in the way they need to reach point in their life where they want to be whether that be in work training or education commend our third sector organisation for what they do and ask for additional government support to prop they up know that my hon friend the minister be such firm advocate for the third sector and for victim support from her lifetime of work in the sector want to talk about good come into our country that be infect with slavery pick up on the comment by my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall may now refer to he as the fresh and beautiful member as that be how he describe himself you be not in the chair for that reflection madam deputy speaker which explain why you look so surprised bournemouth airport in my constituency be one of two major airport in the uk the other be cardiff where good make by force labour particularly in china be come into our country and we must get grip of that commend bournemouth daily echo for its reporting which have shine light on this and the work of colleague in this house and the other place in try to expose this horrible activity we need to stop good infect with slavery from come into our country and will be call on the government to do more on that since come into office nine month ago the government have do fantastic amount of good work have mention the reform to the rented sector the reform to employment right and the investment in our public service which will prop up vulnerable young life and reduce vulnerability to enslavement commend the commitment to combat cuckooing as specific offence our commitment to introduce stand alone offence of child exploitation and the creation of the fair work agency through the employment rights bill also commend the drive to eradicate the decision backlog which will come in time as we have hire additional home office staff to process modern slavery case be also particularly pleased that the modern slavery portfolio be hold by the minister for safeguarding and violence against woman and girl want to close by talk about really important contributor to the fight against modern slavery the co operative movement want to do that by go back in time in manchester be cottonopolis the big industrial city in the world base on cotton some of the uk cotton come from the confederacy and the us civil war be happen at that time it be also in that the lancashire famine be happen and people be die on the street of manchester but the weaver write to abraham lincoln to say that they be on his side and that they support his fight against slavery at the time they be work one day or two day week that be why in manchester there be square call lincoln square by the john dalton library with statue of abraham lincoln in he write back to the people of manchester thank they for their heroism unknown in any age and any country people in manchester in bond together to fight slavery despite the cost to their own life this country have be compassionate and kind country work hard in our community and at government and parliament level to tackle modern slavery but we be now at an inflection point as we hear from colleague the world be more unstable the risk of modern slavery be great and we need to tackle this issue with uk leadership on the world stage thank baroness may who year ago do so much to lead the way commend the work of the government who know be commit to lead the world on this matter too that bring we to the front bench contribution call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley for secure the debate and for all the work she do in government to give we the modern slavery act which we commemorate and build on today it mean lot to contribute to debate on landmark legislation that affirm our country commitment to eradicate this cruel and insidious crime slavery be one of the great affront to the fundamental british principle of individual liberty the principle that no human being should be enslave it be sad that we need to have debate to remind ourselves of that sad that some of my nigerian ancestor might have think debate on the nature and extent of slavery should never have have to happen again sad that we be have they in the modern day and sad that as we have discuss at least people in the uk be victim and survivor of modern slavery it be hopeful that parliament commit via the act and in many other way to confront the shocking reality that slavery have not be consign to the history book after all it be hopeful that parliament acknowledge its moral duty to protect those who be among the most vulnerable in our society those who be coerce manipulate and abuse in condition that no human should ever endure it be hopeful that parliament set out clear legal definition strengthen law enforcement capability and demand corporate supply chain transparency and action it be hopeful that since the act passage many victim and survivor have be identify and support with great co ordination between law enforcement agency ngos local authority the voluntary sector and more it be hopeful that we have see milestone conviction of trafficker and that more survivor have be give voice and chance to rebuild their life with dignity and hope we should be so proud of all those who have play role in that hope proud of politician such as the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands baroness may and many other and proud of statutory authority such as sussex police in my patch and our local authority and of course their equivalent across the country for the role they play in combat modern slavery we should be proud of those civil servant who work across government behind the scene to make britain leader in the fight against modern slavery know one of those civil servant particularly well and will not embarrass or compromise she by name she but know she be watch and hope that the like of she know that their backstage effort be just as critical as the work do by those who be front and centre be

member have say in this debate we know in our heart of heart that the answer to the question be no what we be do now be not enough and we must do more in particular the liberal democrats believe that

uk international law obligation include the council of europe convention on action against trafficking in human being we must create more safe and legal route to sanctuary in the uk take power out of the hand of the people smuggler who as the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands say go on to force so many of those who survive the dangerous crossing into life of servitude we must ensure

see performance about county line which have be take into school to raise child awareness about the risk and about what it look like do he agree that we could be roll out more education about what county line be to school so that child be well prepared to resist it could not agree more with the hon member it be critical that we educate child about the risk factor and what to look out for and also educate the folk who be spend time support those child whether they be parent guardian carer teacher or other to well identify this and then be able to tackle it before it escalate into something that be completely irreversible we must also ensure that our rightful pursuit of low carbon economy be not do on the back of the slave labour of the uyghurs this echo the powerful call of my constituent dorit oliver wolff who survive the holocaust she have write to the prime minister tell he how her father be send to siberia for slave labour and never return dorit have since commit to spend her time say never again and we must fight to ensure that that be the case this debate will help to get we there on tuesday july the then home secretary and later prime minister and now the

the modern slavery act and its impact we must ensure that our national compassion and generosity be not exploit by the cynical and the sinister as my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp have say the modern slavery act noble intention be sometimes sadly abuse by foreign criminal who rely on suspect claim under the act to avoid deportation he have talk of case that he witness at the home office of immigration lawyer submit copy and paste claim for different client with no attempt make to change the detail he have discuss how in many instance very little proof be need allow illegal migrant and foreign criminal to offer plausible sound story in lieu of real evidence that apply even in case where migrant have previously explicitly deny that they be victim of modern slavery the number of modern slavery claim have go from around in to over in three quarter of those make claim be not uk citizen the most frequent referral route for modern slavery claim be now through the immigration system by the end of of those migrant who arrive illegally in the uk by small boat each year and be subsequently detain for return between half and three quarter be claim to be victim of modern slavery in it be report that albanian convict live in britain be await deportation among they sexual predator violent thug and drug dealer of the group nearly actively claim to be modern slave hop to escape removal the abuse of the modern slavery act where it do happen be not just perversion of the act noble intention but an insult to this country compassion and deplorable diversion of vital resource from real victim we must set an appropriate threshold for support evidence to ensure that the system rightly prioritise the true victim rather than struggle under the weight of claim design to frustrate immigration proceeding many of the claim make under the modern slavery act be genuine plea for help from those in the most frightening and shocking situation of abuse we must ensure that the act be keep up to date to protect they begin by congratulate my right hon friend do not wish anyone to think that she have cross the floor she be just my friend the member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley on secure this debate as have be comment this topic be very close to my heart as it be to hers her passion and insight come through very clearly as she speak and be grateful to she and everyone who have contribute like she have long stand interest in these issue they have be feature of my work since before come to this house in fact spend many hour in meeting in marsham street as somebody run one of the support service in preparation for the bill it be truly something to be celebrate when the modern slavery act be pass it be hugely significant step commend the right hon lady on her role in make that happen alongside the then home secretary now baroness may of maidenhead and all the parliamentarian who have be mention be not politician who generally get carry away about legislation care about outcome rather than word on page but that really be landmark moment as much for the message that it send about our determination to fight modern slavery and exploitation at home and abroad as for the measure that it introduce the anniversary of the act give we an opportunity to reflect on the progress that we have make and the significant challenge that remain the uk be once at the forefront of the fight against modern slavery and would very much like to see we in that role again before come on to how we make that happen will tell story because many people have talk about victim in their constituency and about misconception about victim of modern slavery like many people support many victim of modern slavery in my constituency invite young woman who have be victim of sexual exploitation and modern slavery to an event that be take my son to because she be feel particularly down when she be get into the car warn my son that she be victim of modern slavery and human trafficking after spend full day with she my son say to but mom do understand she be british do think you could be victim of modern slavery if you be british there be many misconception about who be use our service and we have to ensure that it be right for all of they victim be wait too long for conclusive ground decision and we know how detrimental that be to their wellbeing and recovery that be why have make clear the decision make backlog personal priority our new staff start arrive in december and give they the task of eradicate the backlog by december in few short month we have hire more than new staff and as of last month the backlog be half the size it be at its bad in that be what real effort look like not endless talking not empty commitment not apathy but concrete focus action to deliver result for victim and survivor with compassion and care we have take meaningful step to decouple the issue of immigration and modern slavery and be pleased that modern slavery have return to my portfolio as the safeguarding minister can confirm that the border security asylum and immigration bill will repeal the modern slavery provision link to the duty to remove in the illegal migration act that will ensure that there be no blanket ban on irregular migrant seek modern slavery protection on the point make by the shadow minister the hon member for weald of kent katie lam by no means do that mean that anybody can claim to be victim of modern slavery for start people can not refer themselves into our system for modern slavery only border force local authority the salvation army and the police can make referral and it be up to those agency to ensure that referral be make appropriately our manifesto recognise the need to strengthen the response to serious exploitation the new offence of child criminal exploitation have be include in the crime and policing bill alongside preventive order to provide great protection to child who be be exploit by criminal we will also strengthen and streamline domestic labour market enforcement through the creation of the fair work agency which will provide more cohesive response hear the concern about the gangmasters and labour abuse authority move into that agency all can say to hon member at the moment be that by no means do the creation of the fair work agency mean that my responsibility as minister in charge of modern slavery be remove from scrutiny of what happen in the fair work agency it will just make more work for in different government department understand the concern on the subject but the fair work agency will have great power and resource to do work that so many people have talk about today on monday launch new statutory guidance on transparency in supply chain which provide practical and comprehensive advice for business so that they can go far fast in their fight against modern slavery we be collaborate with our international partner too recently travel to romania to strengthen our joint approach to tackle these awful crime say to my hon friend the member for congleton mrs russell that while be there meet woman who have be traffic to my constituency from romania via paris and london into prostitution therefore very much lend my voice to what my hon friend say about wish people would just stop sleep with prostitute because that be exploitation of those woman the story that they tell in romania be absolutely harrowing we be also work on joint action plan with vietnam will be able to share more information on that in due course those be all important step that we have try to take in the eight month we have be in office but there be so much more to do to support that we have develop the modern slavery action plan in collaboration with the non governmental organisation sector and criminal justice partner the plan set out the first step of our ambitious vision for tackle modern slavery at its root and reform the whole system it reinforce our commitment to work across government civil society business and international partner to prevent exploitation protect victim and pursue those who be responsible for such heinous crime to answer the question about whether the nrm be stuck not work and need reform we will soon launch public consultation on how the government can improve the process of identify victim of modern slavery if do nothing else the reform of the nrm be something that feel fairly certain can commit to it be not work the system do not work say to the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands nrm reform yes please let we take part in the consultation no doubt her committee will on there be two tier system of protection for victim the right hon lady also talk about this that be an absolute reality that recognise have see that directly from my work the issue mention by more hon member than any other be transparency in supply chain and the need to go far as have say we be do whatever we can in the meantime in lieu of new legislation to ensure that we be improve the system that we have and make report well and more transparent however hear the call very clearly like the right hon lady have be wait for piece of modern slavery legislation it have be promise in every speech whether king or queen but be yet to come with regard to that nothing be currently off the table for member who want to work with the government on that make special mention of the uyghur muslims who have be mention time and again in this house and the real need for we to act robustly especially as we see other country advance in this space so that our country do not become flooded area place where thing can happen that can not happen in the european union or among our partner in the us my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall who be look great it seem like we all have to say that and other members mention hope for justice hope for justice be very much part of the core group of those we take advice from in the department and speak to euan regularly have meet the victim navigator that many people refer to and see the absolute value of they many people mention devolve decision making be completely convinced as policymaker that we should seek to expand devolved decision making as regard child that be far more preferable on the review panel the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns say that of decision to turn down case be overturn which somewhat suggest that there be no need for review because the review system already overturn the decision be not without sympathy on the point about the review panel it be not something that have be particularly raise with by the sector expert work in concert with but will take that away as for temporary worker and domestic visa be very much alive to the issue of domestic worker visa and the way that domestic worker have be force through the nrm potentially unfairly and incorrectly be also quite alive to the idea that we have visa system in our country that allow incredibly rich people to bring domestic worker with they have busy job and cook my own dinner as feminist have keen eye on the whole system of domestic work servitude think have answer all the question ask of it please that there be still huge enthusiasm in this place for push the issue forward as there be year ago that will only ever be rival by the enthusiasm in the other place be glad that be not the minister speak on this exact subject in the debate there tomorrow because the member there be fierce force expect progress to be make on this issue and look forward to work with everybody here on all the issue hope that people feel that we be open to suggestion and to work together as think we be when we first get there on the legislation start by refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests which fail to do in my opening speech be worried that may have just talk about thing that have an interest in without refer to that interest so have do that now also pay tribute to you madam deputy speaker because you be member of the bill committee and be an integral part of deliver this legislation we be there together go through this it have be fantastic debate thank everybody who have take part and will briefly try to mention all of they say to the hon member

his great experience it be wonderful that we have so much experience in this house thank everybody for take part the voice of the victim have come through in the debate and we must never ever forget they want to work across the party on this issue as we always have to keep deliver for those victim we owe it to they question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the tenth anniversary of the modern slavery act double british summer time motion make and question propose that this house do now foxcroft spring be in the air and it be almost time for familiar ritual on sunday the clock will go forward by an hour and our evening will become light overnight as british summer time begin frankly each time the clock go forward and back it be bit of faff think we have all look in confusion at the clock on the car dashboard try to remember how on earth to change it understand that clock mechanic will be carry out the task of adjust the time on more than clock across the parliamentary estate include on big ben no mean feat have to say that be always lot happy with the spring clock change than with the autumn one which plunge our community into long evening of darkness be this the right time system for today think it be time to talk about time it be in that the first serious proposal for daylight saving time be make in britain angry at the lack of daylight during summer morning campaigner by the name of william willett self publish pamphlet call the waste of daylight although he do not live to see his proposal enact british summer time be first establish during world war one by the summer time act which be still in force today however it be the experiment during the second world war british double summer time to which would like to turn today as britain face peril winston churchill take the decision to move the clock two hour in advance of greenwich mean time in the summer and one hour in advance of gmt during the winter month why to save energy the crisis at the time mean that bold idea be require we need to think outside the box today we face different emergency the climate crisis but one for which the same prescription could really help believe that we should learn the lesson of wartime britain and move to double summer time one hour ahead of gmt in the winter and two hour ahead in the summer month we know that we must cut our emission and reduce our reliance on fossil fuel we have labour government who be seize the moment through great british energy our new publicly own clean energy company and by retrofit home to help family to save money on their energy bill and reduce emission as the warm home plan accelerate another immediate practical and effective way to cut emission could be to make well use of the daylight that we have by choose churchill time we can reduce our energy use and lower our carbon footprint when it be light in the evening household and business switch on light and heating later that small shift spread across million of home add up to significant difference researcher at the university of cambridge find that an extra daily hour of sunlight in winter evening could save million in electricity bill each year they calculate saving of gwh of energy per winter day it would reduce carbon dioxide pollution by at least tonne each year which be equivalent to more than car drive all the way around the world evidence from queen university belfast show that churchill time would reduce evening peak energy demand by up to gw of electricity take off the grid during the busy time of day offer significant reduction in energy cost and emission all that be great news for the planet light evening mean more time spend outdoors in park or on walk they mean more time visit cafés and pub on our high street give local business particularly in the hospitality and retail sector much need boost when the sun set at people rush home they do not linger in our town centre or high street or stop for coffee when the sun set at pm or pm we change the rhythm of our day we create opportunity for commerce connection and community that would especially be the case in autumn half term in the british association of leisure parks piers and attractions claim that light evening would increase tourism earning by between billion and billion and would bring increase tax revenue and have positive impact on the uk balance of payment particularly from overseas visitor this week the tourism alliance tell that there be real case for churchill time to boost tourism in the so call shoulder season help more visitor to enjoy everything our amazing country have to offer all year round which mean job and growth some will ask what about the morning do we need light in the morning those be fair question however the evidence tell we that the cost of dark evening be high than the cost of dark morning study show that road collision increase by in the two week after the clock go back in october the royal society for the prevention of accidents point out that during the work week accident be always high in the afternoon evening peak than in the morning peak for much of the winter during that most dangerous afternoon evening peak about an hour and half be currently in darkness this change would more than halve that similarly the aa estimate that around life year would be save by reduce accident in the dark evening brake the road safety charity tell ahead of this debate that with five people kill on our road every day more strategy that reduce road death and injury can only be positive thing change to light evening could prevent hundred of accident and injury every year that be not just statistic it be life protect hospital bed free up and family spar tragedy the result would be few injury less pressure on our emergency service and reduce strain on our national health service sunshine cheer we up too accord to the nhs lack of sunlight may lead to low serotonin level which be link to feeling of depression get outside have many mood boost benefit surely the health the refreshment the happiness of such gift can not be report may vol that be what the then hon member for blackburn say in this place back in when debate daylight save time lament the waste of daylight he ask your predecessor madam deputy speaker if there could be more wasteful more unhygienic more senseless proceeding official report may vol will not go quite that far simply put believe that we should make the most of what we have urge the minister to consider let we spring forward to greener and bright future thank my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer for secure this debate be grateful for her insight and remark on this important topic which as she explain impact on everyone life in one way or another she describe the clock change as bit of faff which think we can all appreciate she then go on to discuss the reason she advocate for this change in great detail in my remark will go on to explain why there be also potential negative to what be be propose as my hon friend mention seasonal clock change be first propose in the early to extend daylight hour for recreation to improve health and to save on lighting cost at the time clock be set to greenwich mean time all year round result in early sunrise and sunset in the summer the idea gain traction during the first world war because of the need to conserve coal which lead to the adoption of change in biannual clock change have continue ever since with brief deviation from the pattern during the second world war when double british summer time be introduce and between and when the clock be put forward but not back as part of an experiment think those be also the first four year of my parent marriage an experiment that thankfully have last much long it be eventually discontinue however due to inconclusive result regard its effect on road casualty about country worldwide currently adopt some form of daylight save british summer time be the uk version of european summer time which follow the same pattern by change the clock twice year by one hour this synchronisation allow for smooth transaction in trade travel and communication across europe the government be aware that the issue of daylight saving have at time attract extensive public and political debate with suggestion to adopt british double summer time british double summer time be introduce for short period during the second world war as have mention by extend daylight hour into the evening it reduce the need for artificial lighting thereby conserve fuel introduce british double summer time would result in clock remain one hour ahead of greenwich mean time in the winter and move two hour ahead in the summer by observe british summer time the uk maintain one hour difference with european country throughout the year this would not be the case under british double summer time use germany as an example the time difference with it would vary between winter and summer in winter both the uk and germany would be one hour ahead of gmt result in no time difference during summer the uk would be one hour ahead of germany the government believe that the current daylight save arrangement represent the optimal use of the available daylight across the uk change the current arrangement would impact all citizen in the uk and northern ireland and would require public consultation and assessment of the impact on business across all sector of the economy as my hon friend have mention there would of course be benefit to move to double british summer time we know that dark hour exacerbate mental health condition particularly seasonal affective disorder the short day and reduce natural daylight as result of clock change can worsen symptom accord to the charity change mental health we also know that there be evidence that enforce clock change can disrupt sleep health especially in forward direction such as that which currently occur in march and will be happen again in three day time however we also know from the british sleep society that natural daylight in the morning be critical for alignment of our internal body clock move to double british summer time would cause dark morning especially in winter we be also aware of some evidence that abolish clock change would reduce road accident analysis from the rac foundation and road safety analysis show that between and there be increase in road accident over the two fortnightly period when the clock change take place in term of energy use keep to gmt plus during the winter month might be expect to reduce overall energy use as people use less artificial light in the evening however the effect be likely to be small in magnitude and may even be uncertain there might be no effect at all the most significant effect be likely to be associate with lighting demand as demand switch from the evening to the morning while there might be some benefit there would be risk of the uk energy system be affect by the time zone choice of neighbouring country with which it trade gas and electricity for example the time difference between the uk and france mean that peak demand be stagger across the two country and allow for interconnector to play role in meet peak demand throughout the year this result in low energy generation require in great britain and low price for consumer if the time difference be to change that could have impact across the energy system include on the benefit assume from interconnection there might also be road safety impact advance the clock in spring create short term disruption in sleep pattern which can cause fatigue this can lead to inattention poor decision making and delay reaction time all of which be contribute factor to road traffic accident summer time arrangement have lead to concern about the disrupt biorhythm of animal with respect to change milk and feed schedule although of course these impact be expect to be reduce due to the deployment of new equipment artificial lighting and automated technology the approach to daylight saving be complex area give the importance of just in time supply chain to many industry many sector and business example in the aviation industry would need considerable notice of any such change there have be examination of all this in the past follow call for evidence the house of lords report clock change be it time for change find that the abolition of seasonal change of time in the uk in any circumstance would require adjustment in sector range from transport to energy and software development such adjustment would bring some transition cost which could be burdensome for industry when scheduling especially internationally which would be concern particularly for aviation in that report the european union committee conclude that it do not receive compelling evidence to suggest that the current system of seasonal change be problematic for the uk while note that there be lack of contemporary study on the subject move to double british summer time would create time border between ireland and northern ireland if ireland maintain its current approach to time that non alignment could cause problem for transport particularly aviation tourism trade and business in general with high impact if there be only part year alignment this view be not only hold by uk industry and represent body it be also report in eu and non eu country response to european commission consultation in the uk seasonal change of time facilitate light evening for over half the year and reduce morning darkness in winter the latter effect be particularly pronounce in northern part of the uk especially scotland double british summer time in the north of scotland would mean no daylight in the winter before am while in the rest of scotland sunrise would be at am opponent of change point out that in scotland child would have to travel to and from school in darkness as point out by the scottish government in their write evidence to the lords committee farm vehicle and other large vehicle would spend more time on the road during the hour of darkness far add to the risk in the department for business innovation and skills publish review of the scope quality and robustness of available evidence regard clock change the review find that there be challenge in look at the overall picture of the impact that might occur across range of issue include energy consumption and road traffic accident to conclude this government will always listen carefully to any argument that be put forward around how to mitigate challenge and provide support particularly in area such as mental health we appreciate the concern raise about the potential impact of clock change on mental health and road safety and we will always welcome view on how we can enhance our exist measure and initiative as set out in our get britain work white paper the government be commit to expand access to nhs talk therapy for adult with common mental health condition such as depression include seasonal affective disorder this government treat road safety with the utmost seriousness and we be commit to reduce the number of those kill and injure on our road my ministerial colleague at the department for transport be develop the first road safety strategy in over decade and will set out more detail in due course thank my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard again for secure the debate she have raise some interesting point but the evidence for the case for change be not overwhelming however will take this opportunity to remind everyone that the clock go forward on sunday and it be also mother day question put and agree to house adjourn
