the high street in edgware watling avenue in burnt oak brent street in hendon and vivian avenue in west hendon however when talk to business owner they all too often tell that they be struggle to find

parking charge on top of rise and there be the sword of damocles of possible village car parking charge will the minister reiterate to council that be determined to derail his growth mission that such draconian measure on our high street will do exactly the opposite of what he and his budget be apparently look to achieve and will he perhaps meet they gently suggest to the hon lady that those make up the anti growth coalition be sit on her side of the house and gently point out to she that the high number of business to go bust for year be under the conservative party last year would also happily ask she to use her influence with the conservative lead council in my constituency which be bring in parking charge that will certainly damage the night time economy welcome some thing that the minister have refer to regard high street business and thank he for that but there be many other matter for example in newtownards family business make up great many of the attractive high street business such as wardens knotts bakery and the family butcher and they be important as they be in ballynahinch have the minister have the opportunity to talk to the chamber of trade in newtownards which be work well other chamber of trade in my constituency can also contribute so have there be an opportunity to speak to they to get their idea about the way forward the hon gentleman be an assiduous champion for his constituency in this house if he want to bring his chamber of commerce to meet to discuss issue in his constituency in more detail will happily make time to meet he and they we be minute go and still on question we need to speed up little bit if the minister could look at that would be helpful so that we be go through the third person know that mr shannon be popular but even so it should go through call the liberal democrat spokesperson in my constituency the number of people shop on our high street have not return to pre covid level and we have lose anchor store such as marks spencer and several bank the government urgently need to save our high street but the reduction in retail hospitality and leisure business rate relief from to will come as bad news for thousand of business when will the government deliver fundamental reform of business rate to save our high street and end the penalising of productive investment be grateful for your guidance mr speaker while the hon member for strangford jim shannon be popular you be much more important gently point out to the hon member for wokingham clive jones that we have start the process of reform business rate we be introduce permanently low rate for retail hospitality and leisure from we have listen to business and keep business rate relief and we be open up opportunity for business to come forward with idea for future reform of business rate sectoral collective bargaining if he will take step to increase the use of sectoral collective bargaining the government be commit to strengthen the collective voice of worker and restore the principle that work should always pay that be why we introduce the employment rights bill which will restore the school support staff negotiate body and introduce framework for fair pay agreement in adult social care combine with other measure in the bill that will empower worker union and employer to come together to negotiate fair pay term and condition thank the minister for that answer it be fantastic of the labour government to bring in the employment rights bill within their first day an absolutely brilliant achievement expert say that sectoral bargaining be force to be reckon with for both employee and employer so what plan might the government have to extend sectoral collective bargaining in other sector of the economy my hon friend be right to say that there be plenty of evidence worldwide that collective bargaining improve term and condition and the overall vitality of the economy but we must start somewhere about of the entire work population be employ in adult social care and with turnover rate and rampant abuse of zero hour contract and the minimum wage law we feel that that sector need the most attention first we must make concerted effort to drive up working condition because those who work in that area have be undervalue and underappreciate for far too long and that have to change we must focus on get it right in adult social care and we will see where that take we undoubtedly government legislation be empower the union we see that this week when the secretary of state for scotland be unable to meet cbi scotland an important body because he could not enter his own building because of picket line we read in the paper this morning that aslef rail union insist on use fax machine and will not allow its member to use email how be that help collective bargaining have to educate the hon member on what trade union do aslef be not union in the adult social care sector which be what we be talk about here we want to work on tripartite basis business and worker together with the government to get term and condition right give that we have the low increase in living standard on record under the conservative government would have think that he would want to support that too call the shadow minister the government impact assessment for the adult social care sector confirm that collective bargaining will be very costly for business if pay award match those of junior doctor the cost of the increase wage bill will be billion drive up business rate reduce employment or hour and impose further cost on business can the minister confirm when further collective bargaining will be roll out to which sector and by how much those business can expect to be clobber if the shadow minister be complain about the state of the adult social care sector he should look to his own party and how the sector be leave to rot for year the impact assessment say that the overall cost to employer will be overall and as the economic analysis say the make work pay package will help to raise living standard across the country and create opportunity for all think be fantastic achievement to get such deal if he do not want to support improve working condition for people an end to fire and rehire and well maternity protection he should continue to vote against the employment rights bill but do not think his constituent will thank he for that industrial strategy what recent progress he have make on develop new industrial strategy we have make significant progress in develop new industrial strategy and be delighted to report to the house that we publish green paper on october set out our plan for modern industrial strategy we have set our sight high than the previous government we have throw off their ideological shackle and we have work in partnership with business and our colleague across the nation and region to set we on path to credible year plan deliver the certainty drive and ambition that business need to invest in the uk for year business in rural community such as my constituency be ignore and neglect by the conservatives in government will the minister elaborate on how the industrial strategy will allow rural community to share in the proceed of growth the difference between labour government and conservative government be that we believe that growth need to be feel in our community not just measure on spreadsheet know that my hon friend be work hard in his constituency and be already campaign on issue such as banking service which be so important for our rural community he be right the industrial strategy need to be design and implement in lockstep with local leader mayor and devolve leader across the country alongside our wide plan for housing and skill which of course will be part of the picture look forward to work with he on identify the barrier to growth in rural community so that we can break they down the development of marine renewable energy be get close to commercial deployment if we be able to get it across the line it will bring with it supply chain that we can build and hold in this country with view to export across the world that would surely be great result for any industrial strategy what will the government do to ensure that their industrial strategy help marine renewable reach full commercial deployment the right hon gentleman make really good point and would be happy to have proper conversation with he about it marine renewable be huge opportunity for we we can build the supply chain across the country and of course scotland be uniquely place to take advantage of that would love to have conversation about it when it come to an industrial strategy in the labour government first few month they have effectively shut down uk virgin steelmaking capacity with no commitment to primary steel in yesterday budget of broken promise unlike the united states and the european union the government have fail to protect our car manufacturer against chinese state aid they have massively increase the cost to the very driver of industry real business of employ people should the government not call it their deindustrialisation strategy the challenge we have be that we have inherit the bad living standard growth during parliament in modern history we have inherit huge challenge that we have to overcome but we be look to the long term with our industrial order do not need any more do we understand each other do not know whether the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith have be pay attention but we be develop steel strategy which the previous government fail to do with billion of funding we put boost of billion into our car industry only yesterday in the budget alongside billion for the automotive sector and money for life science we be develop an industrial strategy for the long term for the first time and we will not follow the conservative party which let our industry suffer and get to the crisis point that we be now have to deal with the minister mention the car industry yesterday after the budget of broken promise talk about the industrial strategy mike hawes of the society of motor manufacturers and traders say deliver that strategy depend on the uk be globally competitive additional national insurance contributions will put massive pressure on the automotive supply chain which be predominantly sme he describe the lack of substantive measure to support the new car market as hugely disappointing conclude that the cost will soon be feel in reduce uk investment economic growth and job with such dire warning so early on be this not more evidence that labour just do not get business and that its industrial strategy be in tatter before it have even begin for government who do not get business it be surprising be it not that we get billion of investment through the international investment summit twice what the previous government manage after two year of plan it the government be work very closely with the automotive industry we know that the global situation be very difficult and talk to mike hawes very often which be why we put billion of funding into the budget yesterday it be also why we be work very closely with the sector to create the condition we need to transition to electric vehicle and to protect our industry in way that the previous government frankly fail to do bike battery fires what recent step he have take to help prevent bike battery fire the office for product safety and standards within my department have be work across government and industry to protect consumer and understand the cause of any safety issue that have include give consumer clear information that enable they to purchase use and charge product safely assess the compliance of manufacturer and importer to ensure that product be safe when place on the market and programme of work to address the sale of non compliant product available through online marketplace include bike and their battery last week visit the opss teddington laboratory where we launch the department new buy safe be safe consumer campaign two week ago there be fire in floor flat in plaistow in my constituency thankfully the quick reaction of the resident and neighbour and the good work of the london fire brigade mean that they be all able to be evacuate quickly and there be no serious injury clearly this could have be bad do the minister agree that it be perfect example of why we need to continue to work to make these battery safe and run awareness campaign so that resident understand the safety issue and how they can be mitigate and how the battery can be dispose of if they need to get rid of they my hon friend be absolutely right manufacturer must already ensure that product be safe and provide instruction for safe use include safe charging pay tribute to the london fire brigade for the work it be do on this issue unfortunately as we have hear there be far too many fire that be why we launch our awareness campaign last week we be hop through the product regulation and metrology bill to make sure we have power to keep up with technological development and ensure that bike can be sell safely to consumer in the uk make work pay programme what progress his department have make on deliver the make work pay programme as the chancellor

worker absolutely we be determined to ensure that the particular sector that my hon friend mention where low pay and insecurity be rife will benefit we be work closely with business and employer across the spectrum to ensure that we get the proposal right because for too long insecurity and low pay have be rife in the uk economy that have to change call the shadow minister after receive million from the trade union paymaster for its election labour be reward they with package of french style workplace regulation which will increase the cost of do business in the uk to the tune of billion year disproportionately fall on sme that be before the billion body blow to business deliver by the chancellor yesterday in her anti business budget of broken promise do the minister agree with the office for budget responsibility that this government decision will make worker poor not rich as increase employment taxis be pass on in low wage and that business investment will fall not rise as direct result of this government find it incredible that the opposition quote french style labour law because when they introduce the minimum service legislation they always hold up france as the example of where that work already wish they would make their mind up the implication behind the question about trade union funding say rather more about their attitude to how legislation be make in this country than our we do thing because we believe in they if he look carefully at what the obr be say into people pocket as result of the national living wage increase be fantastic achievement

inactivity what assessment have the minister make of the impact of the current rate of statutory sick pay on employee retention my hon friend be absolutely right that we need to get more people back into work and need to support they to return in the employment rights bill we be look to increase the scope of sick pay to include people below the low earning limit and to introduce payment from day one we have no plan to increase the rate of statutory sick pay but when we get the reform through we will no doubt look at how we can reform it for the well my department for work and pensions colleague will consider that in due course after yesterday budget those run small and medium sized business will see their national insurance rise and their wage bill increase those in hospitality run pub or restaurant for example will have reduction in their business rate relief to top it off the employment rights bill will bring more red tape for business those massive change be happen very quickly do the minister agree with the institute of directors that it be perfect storm of high taxis high wage and more red tape no gently point out to the hon gentleman the difficult economic inheritance that his party leave this government to sort out we be determined to walk towards all the tough decision his party refuse to face up to in government if he be against the increase in

robin james who retire today after year of service in this house we all rely on the service of the clerks and know that we be all extremely grateful to robin for the work that he have do over four decade be sure that the whole house will also want to send our thought prayer and good wish to those affect by the terrible flood currently happen in spain some british citizen be affect as well it be good that we will have such ample time to debate the budget because it raise some extremely serious issue on july the chancellor of the exchequer stand at the dispatch box and tell we that there be billion black hole that claim have be repeat by labour ministers subsequently as pretext for the tax rise that they plan all along the chancellor ask the office for budget responsibility to produce report into this matter which be publish yesterday it be call the review of the march forecast for departmental expenditure snappy title have read that report as be sure other have and nowhere do it mention billion that number be not there at all in fact the only reference to number be find on page and in table even the treasury strain every sinew could only find number that add up to billion and even there the obr say that it be not possible to judge how much of the billion might actually have be realise when the chancellor say that there be billion black hole yesterday obr report now prove that that be simply untrue will she come here and apologise for provide that number to the house give that the obr report show that it be simply not true and certainly do not justify billion worth of tax rise the large tax rise in any budget in history let turn to election promise and trust in politic because when we make promise to the public it be important that we keep they laughter do not know why you be laugh because these be your promise the labour party say that its plan do not require any extra tax rise yesterday the government announce billion worth of extra tax rise they say that there would be no increase in national insurance but yesterday they announce billion increase in national insurance let turn now to their final fig leaf work people apparently work people would not be affect in the last couple of hour the chancellor herself on the bbc have admit what we all know all along that work people would be affect as result of low wage in fact we can quantify that thank to the obr analysis be now quite fan of the obr it publish yesterday its economic and fiscal outlook it be page long so some labour member might not have have chance to read it all but have on page in paragraph it tell we exactly how much of that billion national insurance increase will fall on the shoulder of work people the obr say that per cent of the total will result in low real wage for work people so of that billion increase will fall on the shoulder of work people that be billion year low wage as result of yesterday budget that be not that be the obr so perhaps the leader of the house would like to apologise to those work people for the billion pay cut she have just hand they during the election campaign conservative members warn that labour plan would result in tax increase per work household and labour call we liar remember be on the radio and the tv and labour shadow ministers at the time include the leader of the house think call we liar we now know the truth billion year that be per work household so about more than we warn perhaps she can apologise for that as well we also warn that the tax burden would increase to of gdp the obr say that it will be of gdp higher even than we warn when labour call we liar that be the high tax burden ever in our country history so the government be elect on false prospectus the obr have now tell we that will result in low growth by the end of the forecast period and high inflation the truth have finally come out the government be go to tax more they be go to borrow more and they be go to spend more and now we know who will pay work people to the tune of billion year can just say to the shadow leader of the house that he say you be definitely not responsible for this budget want to make that very clear thank you mr speaker may too join you in pay tribute to robin james who have be clerk here for over year most recently on the committees on standards and of privileges which have certainly put he in the spotlight in recent year know he wish to retire to wales with the twin ambition of learn welsh and finally learn to drive be sure we wish he well with both those endeavour also congratulate my hon friend the member for high peak jon pearce on the birth of his newborn daughter connie this week finally think the conservative leadership contest will finish this weekend and it could be all change on the opposition benches this could be my last exchange with the right hon member for croydon south chris philp he be well know for his ambition and perhaps today be another audition for high office be sure he would welcome promotion from the detailed discussion we have on restoration and renewal and house procedure and be that sure he will be look forward to that thank he for the work that we have do together if this be our last exchange will really miss his how shall put enthusiasm because god love trier let we hope the next conservative leader do too as the right hon gentleman rightly say yesterday we see history make with the first ever budget deliver by female chancellor be so proud of my friend for smash that glass ceiling the country vote for change and our budget live up to that promise we have make clear choice we have choose responsibility over recklessness reliable public service over endless crisis put work people first investment over decline budget that be now back by the international monetary fund an unprecedented endorsement of budget in many way it be not budget that we expect or want to make but we have have to fix the mess leave by the conservative know that conservative members do not like to hear it but they be not straight with people before the election the office for budget responsibility which the right hon gentleman quote have make it clear that have it know the true state of the public finance in march its forecast for the previous government plan would have be materially different do not usually agree with the former chancellor kwasi kwarteng but perhaps the right hon gentleman should heed his advice today he say that the situation labour inherit be structurally difficult in other word we be clear up the conservatives mess be little confused mr speaker do the right hon gentleman now accept that there be black hole but disagree on the amount or be he still in denial that there be even black hole at all it be ironic that the conservatives spend all week undermine the obr but be now try to hide behind the obr figure be not sure which be it he will know that there be huge black hole even before the pay award that the conservatives leave sit on their desk and for which they set aside no money even though they know that someone would have to pay for it we make no apology for the budget which be about long term investment and decade of national renewal that be why it be right that we consider the benefit of investment and not just the cost this country have suffer year of decline and under investment we be rank second low for investment in the oecd we have choose investment not far decline under the tories we have have to be honest about the difficult choice that we have make in the budget give what we be leave with must ask the right hon gentleman and other conservative members how would they fix the finance leave by their government how would they give the nhs the money that it need how would they get the long term investment that the country be cry out for we have absolutely put work people first and be proud of the pay rise that the budget give the poor worker next april there be many more thing to welcome in the budget and be sure that the house and maybe the right hon gentleman welcome they they include one of the big ever increase in nhs spending to deal with the record waiting list that the conservatives leave behind much need funding for special educational need and disability education boost for carer for the first time since the fix the school that the conservatives leave to crumble more affordable social housing money to tackle the cladding crisis usher in decade of national renewal and invest in the job of the future in clean energy tech aerospace automotive transport life science and much more in particular and must say this because it need underlining this government have finally put aside money to pay compensation to the victim of historical injustice include infected blood and the post office horizon scandal and to deliver fairness for the worker pension scheme honestly the most shameful part of the conservatives recklessness with the country be that they promise many time that victim of those injustice would receive compensation but they put aside not single penny not single budget line to pay for it in any of their costing we can not in one budget undo the sorry year of conservative under investment stagnant growth fall living standard and crumble public service but this budget make very good first step forward yesterday large number of woman lobby parliament they represent generation of woman just woman not man which be perhaps not too odd give the value of the conservative party who suffer great injustice in the pensions act they call themselves the women against state pension age inequality campaign or waspi government inevitably take time estimate must be make and legal advice take but would be grateful to the leader of the house if she indicate when we might hear statement on the waspi situation or have the opportunity to debate it so that we can give some hope to thousand of woman include in my constituency my hon friend have long campaign on these issue and have ask about they before he rightly raise the campaigner point he will be aware that the report be detailed and substantial require the government to give proper time to consider all its finding assure my hon friend that as soon as that proper consideration have be give ministers will come to parliament to report on it call the liberal democrat spokesperson also express my sympathy with the people of eastern spain on the tragic scene we be see there understand that year old briton may also be among the dead and we expect the number to go up it be perhaps timely that general debate on flooding be come up welcome that debate and look forward to hear what be discuss there be much in yesterday budget that the liberal democrats welcome in particular we welcome the additional fund for the day to day nhs spending we have long be campaign for that and we very much welcome it however there be patient in hospital who be well enough to leave but can not do so unless they get the care they need unfortunately the million that be announce for social care will not touch the side of what be need to make that system work properly and alleviate the pressure on the nhs will the leader of the house set aside government time for general debate on how good to reform social care join the hon lady and the shadow leader of the house mean to do so early in express the government condolence to and support for those in spain who have either die or lose all their belonging and their home in the recent spanish flood as she say we have general debate in two week time on flood preparedness partly in response to so many question come forward on that topic during this session thank the hon lady for her word about the budget there be lot of good news in the budget that her party should welcome give how much campaigning they have do on many of these issue they should be grateful for some of the measure particularly the big ever cash increase in the earning threshold for carer allowance for which her party have campaign as the hon lady say we have announce huge funding boost for the nhs and an extra million for social care she be absolutely right though that these issue will take time to work through and will need further reform and investment to deal with go forward the age population and the crisis in social care be inextricably link to the future of our health service have many tower block in my constituency and too many constituent find that their lift be regularly break and be not get fix this be not just down to individual landlord it cut across the piece be it not time for debate in government time about how the four main lift company organise their structure and maintenance contract this be stop people

hundred of job two week ago chase up that letter and be tell be go to get reply be even give reference number yesterday at on the dot get timed email tell that the treasury be not go to answer my

volunteer to our community call the chair of the public accounts committee know that you mr speaker take close interest in the enormous restoration and renewal project in this house which be estimate to cost at least billion of anybody at least we be currently spend million week on maintenance in this place large chunk of which be take up by the cost of prepare for restoration and renewal put it

we have be talk about this since and it set bad example to the rest of government if we can not even manage our own affair thank the hon gentleman for raise that issue mr speaker and discuss this matter regularly and we share the concern about it as do many other across the house the hon gentleman be right to say that this building be in desperate need of investment and of restoration and renewal he will be aware that three option for how we take the project forward will come to the house early next year and will play my full part in ensure that we restore and renew this fantastic building my constituent claire son elliot be diagnose with diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of four and need wheelchair immediately elliot be now eight and his chair desperately need adjust however due to the waiting list for reablement service claire and elliot have have to wait over six month may we have debate in government time on the provision of reablement service my hon friend raise an

national highways and the government can well work together to deliver critical infrastructure project to reduce accident and fatality on our busy road thank the hon member for that question as he will be aware yesterday we announce additional fund for road and other infrastructure which will play an important role we will deliver an update strategic framework for road safety shortly and will ensure that minister come to the house regularly to report on that my right hon friend will be aware of how much coastal community such as mine depend on bus service not least to get to vital healthcare and be grateful to the chancellor for find the money to retain cap on bus fare in east kent however our orthopaedic centre be in canterbury yet there be now no direct bus service from ramsgate or broadstairs make access hard for the very people with mobility issue who need such service will the leader of the house find government time to debate access to healthcare via sustainable reliable safe and affordable transport that be an excellent question and be glad that my hon friend have raise the issue of the bus cap she will be aware that the conservatives budget for the cap to last only until december and it be this government that have extend it albeit at beyond that date we will bring forward further bus regulation to ensure that local area such as hers and neighbouring authority can once again take control of bus route fare and timetable to meet the need of their community my heart go out to the family of the british national kill in the flooding in spain in the last few day the national farmers union describe yesterday budget as disastrous the country land and business association describe it as betrayal and farmer across rutland and stamford be in distress as my inbox show whether on agricultural property relief or charge full road tax on double cab pick up truck which be hide in the budget the nfu say that the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs do not care will the leader of the house advise on when the next chance to raise this breach of previous promise will be or will she secure meeting with the minister for my local farmer be sorry to hear of the reaction of the hon member local community but we do have to make some difficult choice in the budget we recognise the important role that farmer play in support their local community provide food security and the many other contribution they make to our country it be worth note for she and her constituent that three quarter of farmer who be currently entitle to receive the full relief on inheritance tax will still get it after the budget it be the top that will not be sorry to say it but she will remember that her party lose the support of farmer and that be why my party now have more than new member represent rural constituency since staffordshire fire and rescue service have lose full time equivalent firefighter more than that the number of on call and retain firefighter have drop by more than from to just that be significant drop in the amount of fire cover and the cut have be time deep than in any comparable rural fire service do the leader of the house agree that it be press issue and will she consider debate on the adequacy of fire cover across the country know from my own constituency that such matter be raise all the time fire cover and have adequate fire officer be very important to local community budget have be cut in recent year and know that home affairs ministers take that very seriously home office question be come up shortly and be sure that my hon friend would get good response debate in this place be increasingly punctuate and populate by reference to outside body from the environment agency to network rail and from the migration advisory committee to the much mention office for budget responsibility none be elect or accountable to the people we serve we do not really know who they be may we have debate on the increase blob activism that threaten the separation of power we know about judicial activism but this activism be just as dangerous those body wield immense power and ministers elect to govern should not be stymie hamper cow or chastise by people with no democratic legitimacy the right hon gentleman be well know as blob activist member oh do not mean it that way mean against the blob be sorry to be misinterpret if he be refer to the important this will start off laugh now on point of order mr speaker think the leader of the house need few moment to calm down call the leader of the house thank the right hon gentleman for that perhaps that joke should have refer to one of the prospective leader of the no will not go any far the right hon gentleman refer to some very important independent financial institution that offer this country the financial stability for which be renowne around the world when we ignore those institution as the former prime minister liz truss do we see who pay the great price for that those institution play an important role but he be right to say that they should be accountable to parliament and it be my expectation that those body appear regularly before select committees five year old in the most deprived area of luton be two and half time more likely to have experience dental decay pay tribute to organisation such as the dental wellness trust which do great work on child oral health in luton and beyond welcome our labour government plan to fix dentistry include the provision of supervise tooth brushing programme for three to five year old will the leader of the house provide government time for debate on the positive impact these measure will have across the country my hon friend be right to highlight the dire state that nhs dentistry fall into under the previous government and the really high level of poor oral health that many of our child face poor child oral health remain one of the main reason for admission into and other service and that be why this government be commit to tackle it further work be announce in yesterday budget my hon friend will know that there be debate next week on fix the nhs and be sure she will want to raise these issue there this week the international community be meet in colombia to discuss and drive forward nature protection here in the uk we know that nature be under pressure and decline and believe it be point of agreement across the entire house that agriculture have crucial role to play in protect nature yet yesterday budget set out real term decrease in the department for environment food and rural affairs budget over the next two year may we have debate in government time on the vital role of nature friendly farming and the importance of government support for it share the hon lady concern about nature and the wellness of our nature in this country and we be committed to those issue that be why we have bring forward many plan in recent week and will continue to do so in future week there be many thing in yesterday budget that will work towards that aim would have think she would welcome our drive to be the clean energy superpower that we want to be and all the benefit that that will bring in the future the leader of the house will remember from her visit to redditch the real anger on the doorstep from my constituent about waiting time in redditch and in worcestershire as whole yesterday announcement by the chancellor will make real difference to the people my right hon friend speak to who have be wait too long for the treatment that they deserve will the leader of the house give we some time to talk about how the change announce yesterday will make real difference to those people life know from my visit to redditch with my hon friend that he campaign brilliantly in the general election and before that on bring change to the nhs in this country and on reduce waiting time and waiting list yesterday thank to his campaigning and that of many

the broadland futures initiative be likely to report later this parliament on the future scenario face the area which know deeply concern both and the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew once it be publish will the leader of the house allow we debate in government time on this important report to ensure that we have safe and secure future for this treasured national park and low lie norfolk more broadly thank the hon gentleman for the work he do locally on flood resilience and for raise this matter we want to have the debate next week in part because it be raise during business question so often will of course make sure that the relevant minister come to this house or give statement to it when the report be publish reform the leasehold system be priority for in parliament because have many leaseholder in sheffield central live in unaffordable home and struggle to extend their lease or pay their monthly bill due to high inconsistent and unfair charge as an example one of my leaseholder have service charge of which be increase to as result of build safety issue that be certainly not their fault render their property unsellable will the leader of the house share when the government will bring forward secondary legislation to implement provision of the leasehold and freehold reform act to give leaseholder great power right and protection over their

attack on our farmer the leader of the house have decline to ensure statement on the subject but we have four more day of debate on the budget that mean that there be eight opportunity for the

resolution should have statutory effect under the provision of the provisional collection of taxes act it be pleasure to open this day of the budget debate with you in the chair madam deputy speaker for what will be my last contribution as shadow chancellor be aware that may be relief to member on the government benches and possibly to those on the opposition benches as well yesterday budget be the big tax raise budget in british history it be huge tax on business and take our tax burden up to german level for the first time after the pandemic the previous government also put up taxis but we start to bring they down because high tax lead to low growth indeed the office for budget responsibility say that yesterday billion of tax rise would lead to low pay low living standard high price and more expensive mortgage without remorse and without hesitation triumphalist government have rip up the pre election promise that they make in the big ever assault on our economic competitiveness since the let we look at the promise cast aside so casually the chancellor say that she would not change the debt target because she be not go to fiddle the figure or make something different to get well result yesterday she do exactly that in may she say that labour policy will be fully cost and fully fund no ifs no and no but and no additional tax rise total of time this year she promise not to do exactly what she do yesterday she even say that she want to bring the burden of tax down ordinary family small business and work people believe she yesterday they be betray it go far when we say in the election that taxis would go up by per household over four year the leader of the opposition at the time accuse the then prime minister of deliberate lie three month on they will go up not by over four year but by every year paul johnson call it straightforward breach of manifesto commitment the institute for fiscal studies have today say the continued pretence that these change will not affect work people risk far undermine trust the obr say that of the impact of the national insurance rise would pass through to low wage and because the government plan this all along we now know why they rush so fast to concoct the fiction of black hole something that be not corroborate by the obr yesterday it be cover not just to raise national insurance but to impose countless other tax rise on work people capital gain tax up energy taxis up stamp duty up and taxis on family farm up something we will oppose for the sake of farmer up and down the country work people whose wage the chancellor promise to protect will see they go down business whose profit fund new investment will see they raid market to which she promise stability be absorb the big tax and spend budget in generation and all of we on the outside be leave wonder which be bad the damage to the economy or the damage to trust there be not one person on the opposition benches who be not concerned about the inheritance tax change if be honest do not think there be one member on the government benches who represent farming community and be not also worried the measure have be universally condemn by all the farmer have speak to and live in farming community the national farmers union the ulster farmers union and other be up in arm about this inheritance tax the sum of million draw everybody into that scheme and because of that we must vote against it say to those on the government benches guy you have get it wrong and this time you will be condemn when it come to election time the people who you have hurt will remember please stop use you mr shannon thank my hon friend say my hon friend because he be great friend to we for what he have say and could not agree with he more when we talk about stability anybody who have run business know that the most stable business in the country be family business that be pass from generation to generation this be not just about farm but about any small business that be pass down through the generation this be hammer blow to their plan to invest for the future wish to move on because the main argument that the government make be sure that we will hear this from the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster be that all this be necessary to improve public service we on the conservative benches want to say right up front that it be absolutely right to prioritise public service as health secretary negotiate an increase in the nhs budget of billion year and in this year budget increase it by furth billion many time say as chancellor that want to avoid austerity cut to public service we would have do so this time not by use tax rise that harm work family and business but by take difficult decision on welfare reform and productivity decision that be duck yesterday may suggest that the difference between my right hon friend budget and this one be that although he give considerable extra increase to the national health service he couple they with need to increase productivity there be no word in yesterday budget about increase productivity in the health service thank my hon friend for his intervention but there be an even more basic difference between our budget early this year and this one as result of measure in our budget the growth rate go up whereas as result of measure in labour budget the growth rate go down reduce the number of working age people claim health relate benefit back to pre pandemic level would save billion year it would bring more people into the workforce and improve the wellbeing of the individual concern but welfare reform be drop from the king speech and yesterday budget see the welfare bill rise by an average of billion year accord to the obr increase public sector productivity another area that we do not hear much about to pre pandemic level would raise billion year we hear some warm word about that but deliver it require difficult negotiation with the union that be too difficult for the government who cancel plan to reduce the civil service to pre pandemic level increase the salary of train driver by and give junior doctor pay rise all without ask for single productivity improvement in return it be no string for the union but no help for million pensioner in poverty the government should be ashamed pick the pocket of business which do not vote be the easy path but when it damage economic growth the result be less money for the nhs less money for school and less money for the armed force which be why in the end labour government always run out of money the right hon member be keen to quote the ifs early do he also agree with the ifs that it be not credible for jeremy hunt to claim that plan departmental spending limit would hold and there be no world in which per cent rise would have happen and be sustain hear hear always listen to the ifs and indeed to the resolution foundation very carefully think that the ifs be let answer the point if may the ifs be right to say that it would be very challenging to hold to spending assumption but in the budget early this year explain exactly how we would do that ask the nhs how be we go to improve efficiency so that we can live within tight spending limit the nhs say we need to overhaul the it system we give the nhs billion to do so and in return it be able to deliver productivity saving indicate dissent the hon member shake his head but yesterday the chancellor say that she be go to roll that out to the whole of the public sector think that it be possible to do so my concern be that do so involve difficult decision and the track record of this government be that when those decision involve conversation with the union they run mile the final spurious claim from the chancellor be that yesterday draconian measure be necessary because she have receive the bad economic inheritance since world war two not single independent economist support that claim and it be not hard to see why inflation be at around half what it be in unemployment be at nearly half the level if the public finance be in the same state today that they be in back in the deficit would now be billion high which be the entire budget of the nhs instead we leave behind deficit that have be halve and be low than that of france germany italy japan and the united states if the last government attempt at lever investment into the economy be so successful why in be the uk out of oecd country for business investment the truth be that the last government fail to reform the economy to lever in that investment to pay for the growth in our public service let tell the hon gentleman exactly what happen to business investment under the last government since we attract more foreign greenfield direct investment than not just anywhere in europe but anywhere in the world apart from the united states and china that be foreigner vote with their dollar as to where they want to invest in the world and they say outside the united states and china there be nowhere that we want to invest more than the united kingdom compare that with what the obr say about yesterday budget business investment will not just fall but fall by even more than the amount of the extra investment cause by public investment go up do the right hon gentleman deny that business investment be the low in the under his government if the government be so successful do he also deny that in that respect the uk be out of the oecd country the hon gentleman be absolutely right that for decade we have have low business investment in the uk economy than our peer that be why in the autumn statement year ago introduce full expensing which be the big business tax request to make it more attractive to invest in new factory capital machinery here than anywhere else in the oecd and that be widely welcome the other part of our legacy the so call bad inheritance since the second world war be the fast grow economy in the and one that the imf say would grow fast than italy france germany or japan over the next five year the government probably think it be clever political trick to rubbish their inheritance but trash talk the british economy have world consequence we see the sharp decline in consumer confidence since the beginning of the pandemic lloyds bank kpmg and the institute of directors all say that business confidence have plummet the former chief economist of the bank of england say that the chancellor have generate fear and foreboding and uncertainty among consumer among business and among investor in uk plc and we see high bond yield lead to high debt interest payment careless talk cost job and money and this government have be careless what every economist do however agree be that if we be to increase our living standard to german or american level we need high productivity and that mean more investment but accord to the obr yesterday measure will mean low investment overall high public investment be more than offset by low business investment because of huge tax increase lloyds bank say that the increase in employer national insurance be handbrake on investment ukhospitality say it be tax on job and make it hard to employ people and to take risk on recruitment and expansion the federation of small businesses say it will shrink small business employment and the institute of directors have liken it to the poll tax the shadow chancellor mention hospitality overnight have discussion with the local hospitality industry in cheltenham they have two piece of feedback the first be that they be very worried about some of yesterday announcement on relief and national insurance and the second be that the budget be not as bad as the liz truss budget wonder whether he prefer yesterday budget or the liz truss one actually like neither be the person who reverse the decision make in the mini budget but will say this at least liz truss want to grow the economy and say so explicitly what we have yesterday be budget where the government official forecaster say the impact would be low growth few job and low investment we be promise the most pro growth government in history but in just week we have end up with german taxis and french labour law high taxis high mortgage less investment low wage low living standard and low growth less money for public service on which we all depend and less money in the pocket of work people same old labour same old spin it do end well before and it will end well this time either the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt have confirm that this be his last appearance at the dispatch box at least in his current guise so begin by thank he for his service to government and to the country he and have something in common we both inherit an awful mess from our predecessor he be appoint chancellor of the exchequer as the repair man the adult in the room and be mean to sort thing out after the disaster leave by his predecessor he be suppose to be the antidote to liz truss but in recent day he have become an ally of liz truss unite with she in attack the obr he be bring in to praise the economic institution but he have end up condemn they however he can not hide from the verdict the obr have confirm that the previous government hide billion of pound of pressure that they know about and the treasury have give we full picture of precisely what those pressure add up to the right hon gentleman state that full breakdown be provide by the treasury yesterday but that be just not true in fact the chair of the obr say on sky news last night nothing in our review be legitimisation of that billion claim that be he make it very clear that the obr do not support and have not endorse the claim in the treasury report will the right hon gentleman now confirm with simple yes or no that the obr do not legitimise that claim let read what the obr have say the treasury do not share information with the obr about the large pressure on rdel about the unusual extent of commitment against the reserve have this information be make available materially different judgement would have be reach perhaps the right hon gentleman ought to read the next paragraph in which the obr say that it be not possible to judge how much those pressure would have be offset by saving elsewhere which demonstrate that they be within the range of the normal cost reduction that chief secretary to the treasury would make ahead of any budget the right hon gentleman suggest that thing get well after february they do not they get bad and that be how we get to billion this be not just verdict about what happen but an indictment of the conservative party final period in office the truth be that under his watch the treasury have stop do the basic job of control expenditure announcement be make with no money set aside the asylum and hotel bill be fund by empty the country reserve within the first few month of the financial year hospital building programme be announce without the necessary fund set aside to pay for they pay award sit on secretary of state desk while they look the other way and compensation scheme be announce without the full fund be set aside to pay for they that be an irresponsible dereliction of duty that have lead to we pick up the piece and to the right hon gentleman attack the independent watchdog that be set up by his own party even his predecessor the former member for spelthorne admit this morning that labour be clear up the tory mess if conservative member be more out of touch with reality than the former member for spelthorne let tell they that that be not good place to be the right hon gentleman refer to the ifs which say this morning that the chancellor be not wrong to stress that she get hospital pass on the public finance will the right hon gentleman give way on that point have give way once thank he for give way oh no be not give way the conservatives talk about their golden legacy and we hear the former chancellor read out some of his great hit who be they kid the last parliament be the bad on record for living standard with british family bad off than their french and german counterpart his government have the second low growth in the since the pandemic and the high inflation in the since the pandemic they leave prison system overflow and just day away from collapse and rather than take responsibility for it they cut and run and call an early election have to give the previous government credit some thing do grow on their watch such as hospital waiting list housing waiting list shoplifting insecure work and the decline of our high street that be their record and it fall to we to fix it and start to rebuild britain so there be no point in come to this chamber and pretend that people be make it all up the former chancellor talk about business his party stuff business his colleague the former prime minister say eff business and then the conservatives carry out the policy under they we have the low business investment in the why because of constant chaos in their government mean that business do not know who would be lead they from one year to the next because they cave in to their back benchers and block anything substantial from be build and because business could not hire the worker they need with so many people on the sick this could have be budget where we just muddle through patch up some mistake make by the conservative party and hop something would turn up but that be not good enough we have have that time and again in fact we have have year of it long enough to show that that approach be not go to work the country vote for change and this be budget to deliver change it be not time for more of the same it be time to choose we do not duck the challenge or look the other way we confront the challenge because that be what the country need this be the moment when the country turn corner and set out proper plan for the year to come we do make tax change in this budget which be never an easy thing to do that be because the first thing we have to do be fix the foundation and put the public finance on sound footing with this budget we say how we will pay for what we will do the first fiscal rule announce by the chancellor be to fund day to day spending from the revenue that we raise rule that the obr judge will be meet two year early the imf to which the right hon member for godalming and ash refer have today welcome the budget focus on boost growth through need increase in public investment while address urgent pressure on public service so let turn to those public service secondly there will be more nhs appointment to get waiting list and time down more technology to improve productivity more prevention to stop people fall ill in the first place new surgical hub and diagnostic centre hospital build programme bring from fiction to reality this time found on more than hot air new school to help child learn more teacher to bring out the good in every child and more investment in further education to give people the skill they need it be investment and reform together not just more money into the same system but change the system for new age with productivity target alongside the extra money the right hon gentleman also talk about welfare spending but the conservatives have plenty of time to sort out welfare spending their legacy be almost million people out of work because of long term sickness the truth be that they do not have plan but they do have record and again it fall to we to sort that record out we will take tough action on welfare fraud and we will not give up on those who can work and make contribution because we understand that when the sick can get treat and when every child of every background have the good chance to learn that be not just good for they and their family but for the economy as whole thirdly this budget put in place help with the cost of live for million rise minimum wage with extra help for young worker fuel duty frozen carer allow to earn more the triple lock protect the household support fund extend to help the poor and low deduction from universal credit those be the choice that we make real help for million of people finally we reject the path of decline for investment that the conservatives be plan they want to cut public investment by third that be the right hon gentleman plan to once again cut back on the house building school hospital and transport project that the country need that be path of decline that have be choose too often in the past the tories do not yet have leader and the only policy to come out of their leadership contest so far be to cut maternity pay but on the question of investment they do have position budget be about choice and yesterday they choose the former prime minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak rail against our new investment rule and more conservative members have speak out since what do that mean their position be new money for housing oppose new money for school oppose new money for pothole oppose new money for research oppose investment in the future itself oppose by the conservative party understand the peril of opposition we have have long enough experience of it but if the conservatives really want to run around the country oppose every new investment over the come four or five year be our guest yes this budget be big choice and in oppose the investment within it the conservatives have make big choice too we will remind they of it project after project year after year they want to lock we into the world that voter reject just four short month ago my right hon friend have mention the policy or lack thereof that have come out of the tory leadership contest unfortunately spend an evening watch the gb news debate between the tory leadership contender and the one policy that one of the contender say she would put in place on day one as prime minister be tax cut for private school that be the priority of the modern conservative party oppose the investment in this budget while offer tax cut for the very rich thank my hon friend for his intervention although have to say that his television view choice be little bit different from mine with regard to education we have always say that we support aspiration for all child in every type of school our growth plan be about far more than this budget they be about plan reform to get britain building challenge that be duck by the conservative party year after year they be about more clean energy for energy security they be about private investment with billion of investment announce at our investment summit just few week ago investor be finally appreciate the stability that have come to the country after the chaos work by the conservative party and they be about reform of business rate to support our neglect high street this be big moment for the country in july the public do not vote to carry on as we be they do not vote to continue with the plan of the conservative party they vote for change and this be budget for change not just change in policy but face up to the reality of what the conservative party leave behind it be budget to stabilise the public finance to help people with the cost of living to begin to turn our public service around and to start to rebuild britain it be choice between investment and decline turning of the page after year it be budget that launch new chapter for britain and we will be proud to vote for it in the lobby next week call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be pleasure to speak in this debate in response to the first ever budget deliver by female chancellor this government have inherit mess and we know that the cause of that mess be the legacy of reckless economic mismanagement leave behind by the previous government the liberal democrats be glad that the chancellor have listen to our call for investment and support for the nhs to start repair all the damage do to local health service by the conservatives we will continue to stand up for our constituent and press the government to act with urgency and to provide the support to public service that be so desperately need the nhs have be stretch to its limit after year of conservative neglect and the liberal democrats have be tirelessly campaign for an emergency health and social care budget to get it back on its foot we therefore welcome yesterday announcement however we need to see outcome include people be able to see gp within day cancer treatment target be meet and people have dentist appointment when they need one we will hold the government to account for deliver on these issue million of people have long term health condition that make they too ill to work and million more be stick on nhs waiting list many other can not leave hospital because there be no care provision the liberal democrats have always understand that we can not have thriving economy and strong public finance until we fix the crisis in health and social care so we welcome some of the step that the government announce in this direction yesterday the liberal democrats have campaign on improve support for carer while be glad that the government review will look again at get rid of the cliff edge for carer allowance and the earning limit hope that the chancellor and her colleague will consider broad review to give family carer the support they deserve we will hold they to account for ensure that this new funding be deliver for patient and carer include through extra gp and hospital appointment also welcome the promise make by the chancellor yesterday of full compensation for the victim of both the contaminate blood scandal and the horizon scandal and hope that that can be deliver quickly to bring the victim close to the justice they deserve the previous conservative government yet again show themselves to be totally shameless with the revelation that while they promise to compensate the victim of the hideous infected blood scandal they entirely neglect to set aside the fund to actually pay for they it be essential that there be transparency in government spending and we be glad that the government be strengthen the power of independent body such as the obr to ensure that taxpayer receive value for money we be glad that during the chancellor budget she commit to invest to modernise the system of his majesty revenue and customs use the very good technology and we be glad that she have commit to recruit additional hmrc compliance and debt staff invest in hmrc reduce the risk to business and individual in navigate the bureaucratic and often complex process associate with this service have hear from business in my constituency of the risk they face by not be able to directly speak to someone at hmrc strengthen these service with great resource should benefit not only business but all those require to complete self assessment great resource will protect citizen from unfair charge include the loan charge and allow people to access clear advice and support make our tax system more efficient while be pleased to support many of the announcement make by the chancellor yesterday be concern by her decision to raise employer national insurance contribution fear that this will be deeply damaging to many already struggle small business and care provider so we urge the government to at least consider exempt social care from the employer national insurance tax rise the chancellor have provide extra funding for the nhs and other public sector organisation to cover the cost of the tax rise however the vast majority of care provider be in the private sector so will not benefit from this help small business be the beat heart of our local economy for year under the last conservative administration these business have struggle have to carry the burden of rise energy price interest rate and the red tape of the conservative brexit deal urge the government to go far than the announcement make yesterday on business rate by fundamentally overhaul the break business rate system which be destroy our high street and town centre the liberal democrats believe that there be much fairer way of raise revenue our manifesto set out our call for fair tax system include raise money by reverse the conservatives tax cut for the big bank or by ask the social medium giant to pay bit more we do not believe that it be right or fair for the government to instead increase the burden on small and medium sized business which be the engine of our economy and which be already struggle under the unfair tax system set out by the last conservative government we welcome yesterday news of increase funding for school support child and young people must be central to any government policy after school be leave to crumble by the last government we be glad to see an increase investment in education however the liberal democrats oppose end the vat exemption for independent school we do not support tax education and we believe parent should have choice about how they educate their child we be disappoint that at no point in the chancellor budget be there mention of europe the government can not indefinitely ignore the damage that the conservative shambolic brexit deal continue to have on our economy do you not think the fact that you be support all the spending commitment but none of the tax rise be the reason that the lib dems will never be in government order sit down please the hon gentleman say you twice rise be not go to allow the hon gentleman to continue be glad the hon gentleman have raise that point refer he to our general election manifesto in which as have already say we set out range of tax raise measure include reverse the conservatives tax cut on big bank and tax the social medium giant there be plenty of way that the government could have raise taxis more fairly than by place additional burden on small business which will be the engine of economic growth brexit be another reason why our economy be not grow in the way it should urge the government to acknowledge the seriousness of yesterday report from the obr outline the continual damage that brexit red tape cause uk business and the obr finding that weak growth of trading exacerbate by brexit will reduce the overall trade intensity of the uk economy by in the long term we understand that rebuild our relationship with europe be gradual process however we be disappointed that the government have rule out join the single market in the future even when relationship improve we urge they to consider the breadth of benefit that strengthen trading relationship with europe would bring the liberal democrats want to forge new partnership with our european neighbour build on co operation not confrontation and to move to new comprehensive agreement do my hon friend agree that although the new government say they want to reset their relationship with europe if the no thing on the european union mind be youth mobility scheme that the government be rule out they be not go to get very far be grateful to my hon friend for make that point and she be absolutely right the first thing we should be do be negotiate youth mobility scheme we owe it to our young people who be struggle more than most in the current economic environment the mismanagement of our economy by the outgoing conservative government have leave deep challenge and we understand that undo that damage will not be easy nevertheless it be not right for the consequence of these decision and for this burden to be carry by some of the most vulnerable in our society in july urge the chancellor to remove the two child limit on social security payment in her first budget and we be disappointed that this do not happen no child should grow up without adequate food warm home or security for their future currently million child be affect by the two child benefit cap parent subject to these limitation have less available income for childcare cost and therefore experience barrier to employment the liberal democrats believe that remove this cap be the most cost effective way of immediately lift child out of poverty and get more parent back into the workforce and my liberal democrat colleague have also listen to our constituent and hear from countless pensioner who be worried about how they will afford their energy bill this winter since the cut to the winter fuel payment be announce have be inundate with expression of local people disappointment at this decision we will continue to urge the government to give their full support to measure to boost the uptake of pension credit and to ensure that all those eligible for pension credit claim both the benefit itself and the winter fuel payment for year the previous government fail to keep our community safe from crime it be vital that the new government urgently restore the proper community police that local people deserve ask the government to clarify how and when the chancellor will fund the thousand of new neighbourhood officer that her government have promise the metropolitan police service have draw on its financial reserve slash spending and sell off asset during the election our constituency be promise more community police officer but the met have already make cut and saving of over billion and next year it be face funding gap of over million the liberal democrats be pleased to see the chancellor goody bag of infrastructure project yet personally be disappoint that this do not extend to fund for hammersmith bridge some vehicle day use to cross the bridge and those car be now cause gridlocke traffic throughout my constituency in mortlake east sheen and barnes it will cost million to fix hammersmith bridge sum no local authority can afford to pay so hope the government will consider what more they can do to assist with the bridge reopen we all agree that we need economic growth and stable economy after the chaos cause by the last government we know that this dire economic situation require tough decision welcome many of the step that the chancellor announce yesterday but the government must ensure that this do not come at the expense of the most vulnerable ask the government to set out timeline for the delivery of their proposal for investment and urge they to act with the urgency require to ensure that people can access the service they need when they need they the cost of living crisis will not be solve by hit family pensioner family farm and struggle small business and our economy will not grow strongly again unless we repair our broken relationship

and look forward to hear more speech from he agree with the final remark make by the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster this budget mark new chapter in the economic performance of this country it be true but suspect that his prediction and mine which will make clear in my speech be rather different start on the plus side there be measure in the budget that we should welcome my constituent who live in rural area will be particularly pleased that fuel duty be to be freeze for another year because often they have very little choice in how to get to work they must do so by car as say in an intervention yesterday welcome certain government contingency such as on the infected blood and horizon scandal that have now be fund the onus be very much on the new government to ensure that the people affect be pay as quickly as possible even if only with an interim payment so that they can start at long last to rebuild their life spend on special educational need in gloucestershire be particular problem so increase funding will be welcome by parent whose child need help in that area the public accounts committee hold several session in the last parliament on rebuild school and hospital particularly those affect by asbestos and reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete commonly know as raac we also look at the huge project of restoration and renewal in this house if the government get those investment project under way will welcome it but the pac will scrutinise they to see how we can get value for money contrary to what be say in leak to the press before the budget the pension industry appear to have be largely untouched in the budget perhaps ministers will confirm that when they wind up the debate and the trick now be to encourage large pension fund to invest in uk infrastructure we do not hear anything about that in the budget yesterday but know that the government be think about it as predict we have high fiscal burden in this country under this labour government than ever in our history the office for budget responsibility could not find the fabled billion black hole instead it find billion associate with deteriorate circumstance and that will happen to any government in any fiscal year billion be equivalent to some of the public sector pay increase that we have see particular to highly pay train driver the chancellor have increase taxis and borrowing by staggering billion each the large increase in any budget for year the conservatives leave office with low inflation high employment particularly for young people and the fast grow economy in the in stark contrast in this budget the chancellor have put up national insurance and we have inheritance tax up capital gain tax up mortgage up stamp duty up employment cost up and business confidence down the obr have downgrade our gdp growth base on the budget in every year of the next five year forecast that will affect everybody in this country they will continue to see their living standard fall as result there be lot of topic that would like to cover but have choose to cover those that will affect my constituent most adversely first be national debt uk national debt be trillion which be not far off of gdp and it be grow at staggering rate of almost million an hour or million day the interest for service the debt have now reach more than billion which be equivalent to the budget of the fifth large department and it be completely dead money as result of the budget the debt will rise even far by billion involve even high servicing cost which will result in high taxis to pay for it in future year on really important point the obr have forecast that national debt will triple over the next year that be completely unsustainable and should be real wake up call to the fact that we have to correct that dire structural problem but the budget have make the problem far bad we can not just change the rule to make the result sound well interest rate include mortgage will be high for long and our child and grandchild will now be saddle with the debt which they will have to repay for long congratulate the hon gentleman on his recent appointment as chair of the public accounts committee would he like to apologise for the billion black hole that the previous government leave behind and the contribution that make to the awful debt situation that the government inherit thank the hon gentleman for his comment about my election and the pac look forward to scrutinise all government expenditure carefully he have fall into the same trap as everybody else unfortunately the obr say yesterday that it could not find the billion black hole do not have the exact quote but the government be advise when in black hole stop dig suggest gently to labour member that they stop dig because it could not be find the chancellor announce that she expect national insurance contribution to rise by staggering billion although she promise in the election that they would not during the election she say that the measure would not be tax on work people clearly she believe that entrepreneur who spend their time energy and talent form new business be different they will be heavily tax and change the employment rule will make it more difficult to employ extra people national insurance tax and savage cut to the threshold down from to will harm any business in my constituency employ more than four people it could be the difference between business grow and provide more job and business not survive we must all remember that the private sector and individual who work hard and put their livelihood on the line take financial risk to boost productivity and provide the growth the country need and they must be nurture if they be to succeed small business account for more than of all business will the hon gentleman give way the hon gentleman can have try too run small business for at least year do the hon gentleman welcome the increase in the budget to the allowance on national insurance from to which will protect small business and help they grow have run business for much long time than that there be many measure in the budget that will be very deleterious especially for the small business and we will have to wait and see how they turn out the budget will have serious implication for farmer and rural community in my constituency refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests as farmer be incredibly disappointed that from agricultural property relief and business property relief will apply only to the first million of asset that will worry many in my farming community and those in many other constituency it will result in few farm to rent equally damaging will be the cap on the amount that can be transfer to spouse for inheritance tax purpose the purpose of that tax relief be to ensure that work farm that provide our food will not have to be split up after the death of family member very few farm be value under million basically only those of less than acre be and the rest will face tax that will lead to the loss of job and livelihood in the north cotswolds and elsewhere it will change the fabric of our countryside permanently the structure and productivity of agriculture will change as more and more farm be split up and sell off as result of this measure accept that the hon gentleman have great experience in farming but do he read the analysis by professor andy summers of the london school of economics which show that the million relief be on top of the million couple allowance the benchmark be really million farm and the average estate value be low so only about estate will be affect year in this case only small number of uk farmer will be affect and it be not the armageddon for farm that the conservatives be claim suggest gently to the hon gentleman that whatever the number if the change cause damage to the farming sector and the productivity of food production it be not helpful and nor do it raise much money what we surely want be measure in the budget and elsewhere to boost the productivity of our agricultural sector so that we can produce more of the food we eat ourselves rather than import it from the rest of the world encourage the chancellor to release any impact assessment she have do on this measure hope that she will reconsider this proposal although doubt she will now turn to topic that have mention many time and one that will continue to raise with the treasury the chancellor have talk about the difficult decision that she have have to make on tax and spending to promote growth may suggest one specific policy area tax free shopping which have the potential to increase growth considerably since we leave the eu british people have be able to shop tax free in european state however we have not give the same advantage to wealthy visitor visit the uk to spend their money here and benefit our economy that disincentive to visit the uk will be bad if visa cost be increase have talk to some of the big business involve in this area and they be see that instead of visit the uk people be go to paris madrid or milan to do their duty free shopping we be lose out as result that whole new market unique to the uk be worth an estimate billion annually in foreign spending and would generate more than billion for the exchequer base on an oxford economist report that say that for every spend by visitor be generate for the exchequer the only thing stop ministers in the last government look again at this issue be the treasury forecast which unjustifiably in my opinion predict little or no impact on eu visitor number or spending level that lead to the wrong conclusion that there would be cost to the exchequer even without all the other add benefit have mention for hospitality airport and luxury good manufacturer which would help the economy all the datum on actual spending supply by real business prove the opposite my only ask of the chancellor today be that she take the cost free decision to review the impact forecast in the light of overwhelming real datum and this time unlike the last ask the obr to scrutinise the treasury forecast impact of extend the scheme to eu visitor would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with ministers and could bring expert with to help the discussion as the new chairman of the public accounts committee remind treasury ministers of the report produce in the last parliament call lessons learn planning and spending framework that enable long term value for money about how the treasury should focus on get the good value for every of taxpayer money spend the pac will scrutinise the whole of the government expenditure and help they to get well value for money we have another maiden speech from

challenge that face the resident of dagenham and rainham hers be constituency know well since drive back to my own on the every week sometimes when it be closed as happen last week find myself explore even more of dagenham and rainham also congratulate the hon member for worcester tom collins who also make very good contribution we look forward to hear from both of they in the future want to start by put on record the thank that think be due to my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt the shadow chancellor and my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak the former prime minister one of the extraordinary thing have find in the budget speech that we be debate be the complete failure to mention the two extraordinary challenge that the government have to face covid and the economic consequence of putin invasion of ukraine those two event combine potentially threaten the survival of every business in this country and could have lead to catastrophic increase in the cost of live for ordinary people it be only through the intervention of the then government in provide support that we manage to keep the economy go and that those business and the job associate with they survive find the chancellor failure even to mention that challenge when talk about the economic legacy extraordinary it have leave we with legacy but despite the level of borrowing that be necessary the government be bring it down and have restore the economy think that when the history book be write lot of credit will be give to my right hon friend the shadow chancellor and the former prime minister do the right hon member accept that the conservative government decision to reduce gas storage and to fail to invest in the nhs over long period make deal with those crisis considerably bad order before the right hon member respond intervention be healthy part of debate but the hon lady should draw the attention of the member by speak loudly in ask for an intervention every country in the world face enormous challenge the record of the conservative government in tackle those challenge bear comparison with any other country that can not be diminish will say little bit more about the nhs in particular as move forward with my remark see that alastair campbell tweet in defence of this particular budget he say it be very labour budget would certainly agree with that it put up spending massively borrow massively and tax massively to that extent it be very labour budget in the first minute of the chancellor speech yesterday she do not actually make any announcement she simply try to justify some of the measure she be go to introduce by talk about the fictitious black hole the shadow chancellor my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash have already adequately expose why that be fiction and the office for budget responsibility be unable to find any evidence for the figure that she quote let we be clear tax and spend be matter of choice it be the choice of this government to break all the promise that they make at the last election it be their choice to break their manifesto commitment not to increase national insurance contribution they say that they would not increase tax on work people but in many area the measure that they have introduce will have significant impact on work people the denial that there be tax bombshell to come be extraordinary give that they subsequently announce billion one which will result in the tax burden in this country rise steadily to what will be the high ever on record yet this be government who take office say that their priority would be to fuel growth can say to the minister that he can not fuel growth by punish the business that will be responsible for create the job and wealth of the future the office for budget responsibility forecast follow the budget show that growth be forecast to fall steadily want to speak about one or two of the tax choice that have be make they too be matter of choice it be up to the chancellor to decide how to raise the extra revenue even before the budget we already hear of one extremely damaging painful decision the withdrawal of the winter fuel allowance to save money by take it away from pensioner across the country have receive many email express great disappointment that the chancellor press ahead with that measure and do nothing yesterday to reduce its impact it be primarily business that will pay the price in this budget the increase in employer national insurance contribution be estimate to cost they billion which represent more for every single employee of business over the threshold what be the result if the cost of employ people increase that can have only two consequence low wage and few job each of those will hit work people on top of that business will face an increase in the national minimum wage that will hit the business that be already find it hard to survive it will impact on the care sector and the hospitality sector already under enormous pressure the decision to increase the national minimum wage for young adult by will make it even hard for those people to find job just day ago the government herald the investment summit which be suppose to persuade international investor that this be country they should want to invest in yet week later we have high capital gain tax and high stamp duty and war declare on non dom instead of investment come into this country already we be see the flight of people live here the entrepreneur on whom our future success depend be leave in drove the right hon member mention people flee the country could he point to at least three example of anyone at the investment summit now say that they will withdraw that money the investment summit announce lot of investment for which the conservative government be actually responsible let we wait and see the budget be yesterday business will have to look very carefully at their plan but do not expect they to do so in mere few hour be happy to have this debate with the hon gentleman again in few week time once we have see the impact of the measure that have be announce there be two specific measure that want to touch on because they have particular impact on my constituent one of they which have be mention number of time in this debate be the removal of agricultural property relief the country land and business association estimate that that will affect business family farm in particular will feel the impact bad it be hardly surprising that the president of the national farmers union have say this budget not only threaten family farm but will also make produce food more expensive the shameless breaking of those promise on agricultural property relief will snatch away much of the next generation ability to carry on produce british food plan for the future and shepherd the environment this be measure that the labour party say it would not introduce but it have break that promise and be now propose to introduce it with enormous damage not just to farmer but to food security and our environment the second measure that would like to touch madam deputy speaker see you have acquire speaker cough will heed your warning but want to mention vat on private school in my constituency have three small independent school heathcote school in danbury elm green in little baddow and maldon court school in maldon the parent who send their child there be not rich they make huge sacrifice in essex we be very fortunate to have really good grammar school those parent make that sacrifice to help their child hopefully get into the grammar but they will not be able to continue if there be increase in fee as result of the imposition of vat they will withdraw their child and those school will be threaten with closure the consequence be that the child will need to be place in state school which be already under huge pressure my constituency be grow rapidly and there be enormous pressure on school this will simply make it bad this policy be simply vindictive and will do enormous damage very quickly note that the minister for secondary care the hon member for bristol south karin smyth have come back into the chamber and she would be disappoint if do not say that welcome the hospital building programme in the budget and the announcement of new money however once again reiterate that hospital in my constituency be threaten with closure we have be promise new one for year or more under both my government and the government before that she be good enough to see my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel and the other day so that we could make the case if she do hold this money hope that she might be able to direct some of it to my constituency this budget be one of the bad have hear in all my time in this place it will do enormous damage be grateful for this opportunity to put that on the record call jon trickett thank you madam deputy speaker will try to be reasonably quick pay tribute to the maiden speech we have hear today which be exceptional in particular associate myself with the view of my hon friend the member for dagenham and rainham margaret mullane when she say that she stand for work class life and community and will do everything she can for they that be how have see my year in this place too think be probably the only person on the labour benches today who be here in so want to say something to the government and to all our back benchers be there when labour come into office be elect in so be here in and the same lack of humility show then by the conservative party which have be thrash by the electorate be be show today there be the same short term memory of the failure their government have commit under john major and the other prime minister before that and the same lack of remorse there be lack of remorse for what we have now food bank britain with million of people in poverty not word from those on the conservative benches there be million of people on nhs waiting list no remorse from the party opposite for that there be no remorse for the fact that our economy have not be properly invest in throughout their whole period in office this country be the low investor in the whole of the there be no remorse for all the other failure either and no sense of humility when the public tell they that they have make series of mistake will the hon gentleman give way no be go to try to be quick be not go to take any intervention all those matter and other too require we to make change in the direction of our economy that be what this budget have begin to do we be turn the page one final reflection on when labour introduce the minimum wage one of the great reform of the century the tories keep we in the lobby night after night after night we be proud to do it the argument they make then have parallel with the argument they be make about our budget today that there will be job loss an impact on profitability small firm will be in trouble and so on let say this eventually they accept the minimum wage because it be the right thing to do there be no job loss and there be no impact on profitability so say to those on the government front bench continue in the direction you be travel but move fast and be even more radical recommend that they have look at spain where socialist government be in place they have think be right in say the high rate of growth in the they introduce wealth tax on estate worth more than million year and they be get high growth that show that determined government restructure the economy as we need to do can deliver change and not damage country economic success represent village all former mining community that be treat brutally by the tory party year ago it be distant memory for many but remember every single moment of the strike they destroy the mining industry and have do nothing to replace it in the last year so we have widespread poverty as there be in all post industrial community throughout our country they perpetrate hoax on those community by say that they would level up the levelling up fund be not direct to where poverty be in any event it be competition in deprivation between one area and another my community get nothing yet we be struggle desperately to achieve growth level up be great slogan but it be use as trick to persuade people to vote conservative in what happen people have learn their lesson let come on to one point that be worried about and then on to general point on transport the difference in the distribution of funding for transport be extraordinary the previous government that lot spend per head on transport in yorkshire in london it be that be three time as much per head per year spend on transport in london than in yorkshire and that leave we with problem represent village rural community in many way deprived community post mining community to get from one community to another bear in mind over people in our area do not have car and the train do not work very well the train service have leave we without adequate public transport by train the only option be the bus bus often do not start until but people begin work at or leave home at have meet woman walk from one village to another in the dark on unlit street because the bus service have not yet start that be problem the conservatives create regret this government decision to raise bus fare from to do not suppose there be anybody in this whole parliament who do not have access to car but there be many people across the country who do not have car because wage be so low people be walk in the dark at in the morning to get to work from one village to another and for those of we who do have bus service it be go up by it will be roughly day to get to and from work that be week and year in bus fare to get to work and back clearly that give we problem in my constituency there be village that be only seven mile apart yet the bus take one hour and minute to get from the one you live in to the one where you work that be completely unsatisfactory if we be go to raise bus fare that be the decision that have be make which regret we need to reform the way bus operate so that they be accessible to community the government have make some announcement in relation to that already which be welcome my final point be on the lack of investment the conservative party preside over for year hear the shadow chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt say today okay there might have be black hole in the public finance but we be go to cover it with cut that be effectively what he say the cut be always take place to investment and they be go to cut more investment if we measure my constituency by gdp per head controversial measure but the one we be familiar with that lack of investment mean the average worker produce per year of gdp wage be peg to productivity as we all know so we have low wage less than year but listen to this in camden we know it be different economy in camden gdp per head be the regional difference between output capacity and productivity be all the result of that failure to invest the budget set out to invest and to invest big and go for growth but will be press for all the hold back post industrial community up and down our country not only the coalfield but in the midland and elsewhere for the investment we achieve and the growth we deliver to be more equitable than it have be under the conservatives with those few thought and an encouragement to be more radical and even more bold for the future let we bear in mind wish the budget well one thing that we always feel after budget be sense of relief because we at least know that we be go to get some answer it feel that when we be talk campaign and raise issue we be always tell to wait for the budget be additionally relieve yesterday because my son manage to pass his driving test theory hon member hear hear thank you do not think the government need any help in talk about the economic legacy leave by the previous government but we do have to acknowledge that the funding structure put in place by the previous government have create legacy as well as expectation want to talk about those that most directly impact north east fife start with infrastructure funding be pleased to hear the city deal announcement in relation to argyll and bute give that have an argyllshire father but want to highlight the opportunity within exist city deal to add value and to make up some of the increase cost we have see in recent year the town of newburgh in north east fife have be cut off from the railway for almost year it have line run through it that transport train day and for the last year there have be campaign to rebuild train station and reconnect it to the line that make sense from number of perspective train station take car off the road it allow investment into the town it can bring tourist to place such as the lindores abbey distillery and it shorten journey time for those travel beyond for nhs or other treatment however the only mention of railway infrastructure be in relation to the city region sustainable transport settlement which be for england only acknowledge that transport be devolve but there be way in which the uk government could look to work with the scottish government in order to help those community where additional funding could make difference the other element of transport infrastructure be access for all which be uk scheme although the scottish government play part in determine which station receive support want to make an additional call for funding for leuchars station which serve st andrews although it be one of the well know part of my constituency it do not have station it sometimes feel that we have fall into the crack between westminster and holyrood on that on disability and on access for all we need to do more at all level to ensure that we deliver the funding return to the impact of the different fund and scheme that be put in place post follow our departure from the eu and the need to replace eu structural funding want to touch on the community ownership fund and the share prosperity fund and other fife mp see two of they in their place recently meet fife council to talk about the future of the share prosperity fund which be due to end in march be pleased by the commitment to continue it for another year although we need to move away from year to year funding be sure we all meet third sector organisation and other who talk about the uncertainty that short term funding bring to the service that they provide we also have to acknowledge that the budget the relevant passage be very short will mean that fife council for example will see cut of about third in share prosperity funding which have deliver programme such as kingdom works an employability service that have support over people the government say in the budget that they want to reform funding and urge they to do so quickly so that we get certainty the liberal democrats have talk lot about health and social care other have speak about the fact that we need to focus on social care because without fix it we will not fix the nhs again the nhs be devolve in scotland welcome the significant increase in funding for scotland it be now over to the snp lead scottish government to deliver on that be pleased too that we will see support for public sector organisation in relation to the national insurance increase however there be no doubt that the nhs in scotland be in dire state in fife there be no nhs dentist currently take patient and in my constituency we be see further cut and closure in dental service the other thing that want to say about what think the scottish government should be do relate to the business rate change that the uk government have bring forward let quote one of my constituent who be report in today courier newspaper say about rate relief we do have the cliff edge in scotland we ve be pay full rate ever since last summer accept that that potentially be not cover by the block grant but give that the whole uk be tourism destination the scottish government need to look at how they well support hospitality and tourism because there be real difference between what be happen in other part of the uk and what be happen in scotland should declare an interest at this point be chair of the all party parliamentary group for scotch whisky and work for diageo for four year before my election at the start of the debate the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster talk about choice for the other aspect of choice be manage expectation that be where the real issue that have with the budget come to the fore mark kent the chief executive of the scotch whisky association say in the scotsman today that the decision to increase rate on scotch whisky not only fly in the face of the commitment to back the industry as core element of the government brand scotland concept it also serve no economic purpose the conservatives increase in alcohol duty be deeply damaging to the whisky industry in the month since it come into force revenue from the tax have actually fall by million so it be clearly not deliver increase revenue to the treasury what we see from the government yesterday will continue to hurt the industry which be so important for scotland the chancellor offer support to brewery through the cut in duty on draught product but that will do nothing to support responsible drinking tax base on strength of alcohol be not the right way to go about it it be about alcohol be alcohol and how it be consume might not represent the most whisky distillery in scotland by number but probably do by volume with the diageo distillery and bottle plant in leven return to the point about promise and expectation we come to farming and the issue of the inheritance tax change the national farmers union scotland say on its blog today that it be pleased to see the roll over of the agricultural funding although that have go into the scottish government block grant so again it be over to the scottish government to ensure that they deliver for farmer we need farmer for our food production and security for our climate and nature recovery which be more vital than ever and for rural growth and support the budget be subtitle fix the foundation but be sadden that it contain no mention of the most important foundation of everything in britain our natural world do she agree that more resource need to be dedicate to the restoration of nature and to support our farmer both of which be crucial to food security absolutely agree whenever have that discussion with farmer they want to support climate and nature they want to do the right thing but they need support to do so as say the overall funding envelope for farmer be for the scottish government to deliver and be confident that my scottish liberal democrat colleague in holyrood will be make the case for they to do so in his intervention on the chair of the public accounts committee the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel talk about how the number of farm affect will be small but the issue be that the government promise last year not to do anything in relation to agricultural property relief yet that be what be happen be already be contact by local farmer who fear that this will be the death of their and other family farm it be important that we remember that it be not just about those farmer it be also about the infrastructure and the wide community that they support such as vet and other facility we should not forget tenant farmer either because they be some of our most vulnerable know that because work with some of they prior to the election in relation to the roll out of universal credit that system be not fit for purpose for farmer the work and pensions secretary be no long in her place but will be come back to she on that issue we need to ensure that we provide that support until very recently wear multiple hat because have far few colleague now that have more of they have give up my department for work and pensions hat but welcome the change to carer allowance would like some clarity about the carer support payment in scotland which be devolved benefit that be currently be roll out have not see it in the note that have look at so far but perhaps it will become clear in the come day whether that be include in the block grant that be come to scotland or whether there will be additional consequential to conclude there be thing in this budget that absolutely welcome but as always there be unintended consequence on which hope the government will listen to we call gregor poynton to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for give the opportunity to speak in today debate first pay tribute to my hon friend the members for worcester tom collins and for dagenham and rainham margaret mullane who have proudly show the good of their constituency in their maiden speech today pay tribute to my predecessor hannah bardell hannah have diligently support our constituent over the past nine year whether by address the broxburn flood assist homeowner affect by raac advocate for those affect by the infected blood scandal or champion right on election night she be incredibly gracious spirit that have continue as hannah and her team have go above and beyond in pass on case and help my team to get settle she say to on the night it all about the constituent and she have be true to her word hannah say in her speech on polling night that she intend to be back in some form of that have no doubt just hope it be not too soon my constituency be call livingston which be understandable as that be the big town in the constituency and the county but the constituency be so much more than that it include town and village such as breich dechmont ecclesmachan uphall longridge broxburn bents stoneyburn addiewell kirknewton wilkieston east calder mid calder west calder and fauldhouse each rich with its own history and distinct community spirit the area economy and population be initially boost by mining of coal in the west and oil shale in the east the landscape still bear witness to this history with the bing that remain that be why it be important to that the chancellor announce in yesterday budget that we be deliver on our manifesto commitment to return the investment reserve to miner we be hand back billion to former miner and their family in fact former miner in the livingston constituency will receive an average increase of per week in their pension for those who would like further insight into scottish oil and the shale oil industry there be the almond valley visitor centre which bring to life the first truly commercial oil work in the world and celebrate the west lothian chemist james paraffin young work and discovery however the big growth in the area be in the with the creation of the new town of livingston many from glasgow and the west of scotland venture east because of the promise of improved housing and job opportunity that entrepreneurial spirit be still alive in livingston which be the home of high end manufacturer like wyman gordon biotech company like valneva glenmorangie bottle plant paterson shortbread factory mitsubishi electric the centre and the designer outlet village sky and numerous small and medium sized enterprise which be the lifeblood of our local economy now that have highlight paterson shortbread and glenmorangie be expect visit from my right hon friend the secretary of state for scotland all in the name of promote brand scotland of course as prepare to give this speech seek inspiration from the maiden speech of two previous mps for livingston robin cook and tam dalyell who know thing or two about speak in this place even in their maiden speech they set themselves apart with their wit intellect and fire for social justice tam dalyell use his experience as schoolteacher to outline practical reform that could be make to the education system and robin cook former chair of housing on edinburgh city council make plea for more and well housing take from they that you should talk about what you know and if can maintain that for my whole parliamentary career think will be do rather well tam dalyell and robin cook be two giant of scottish labour politic who in their different way make mark in this place we new scottish labour mps must now make ours there be scottish labour thread of history in this place from hardie maxton lee and dewar to cook brown and darling live up to that be an impossible task but try we must because in that trying and effort be the opportunity to make change the idea of be scottish mp in the parliament of the united kingdom be important to be scottish and be british do not see these identity as contradictory but they be different give that all four nation be part of the united kingdom and have be in some case for hundred of year it would seem logical that the uk identity would subsume all but that be not so the idea of scotland be powerful it have stand the test of time and it mean different thing to different people in the borders the highland the island community the east the west the central belt urban area and rural area but there be common fabric of what it mean to be scottish and it bind we together whether we be bear into be scottish or choose to make our home in scotland this be part of who we be and have scotland as one of the four nation make our country great than the sum of its part the theme of today debate be fix the foundation because over the last year our country have not be on secure foundation the chaos of the last year across the uk and particularly the last year in scotland where there have be focus on the constitution not the day job have make our country feel less secure and life feel too precarious for far too many family be one mistake piece of bad luck or decision that be no fault of their own away from disaster that be no way to live that be why this budget which ensure pay rise for over of the lowest pay scot let more family keep more of their hard earn cash be important for family right across the livingston constituency want to come to this place to make sure that everyone no matter their background can thrive that be what drive and my politic have grow up in working class family in working class town in central scotland in the and have see what happen when people have opportunity and security and what happen when they do not my father work in plastic plant in grangemouth for over year provide our family with stability and dignity through unionised work without it would not be here today there be hope for the future yesterday budget mark the end of the era of austerity and raise much need cash for our public service this labour budget deliver the large budget settlement for the scottish government in the history of devolution it mean there be an additional billion for the scottish government to spend in this financial year and an additional billion next year this be significant increase in investment to ensure that we have the funding available for scotland nhs school and public service it be now for the snp which have lose its way in recent year to get grip and spend the money wisely recently visit the larder social enterprise provide solution to poverty through learn opportunity and access to high quality affordable food it support young people for whom traditional academic setting have often not work help they to build skill and confidence the larder have have huge success in turn life around so it can be do we have the people and drive to build strong community we have government who be on the side of work people and we should not rest until everyone in this country have the opportunity that they need to build more secure life for themselves and their family that be what resolve to spend my time in this place do on behalf of people in the livingston constituency call my constituency neighbour mims davies congratulate all hon member who have make their maiden speech may wish the hon member for livingston gregor poynton well in his time in this place agree with my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale that the failure of the budget and its long preamble mention covid and the war on our continent be very stark however would like to start on positive note be the woman elect to parliament and it be truly historic moment to see the first female chancellor at the dispatch box she say that it would give hope to other woman who be watch and absolutely agree just hope that our business and sector such as hospitality feel that hope it be very pleasing to hear the announcement of the compensation scheme for infected blood victim my constituent robert in east grinstead have be campaign very hard on that and for victim of the post office scandal which will be welcome by many of my constituent it be also please that fuel duty have be freeze and thank all my hon friend and campaigner who make sure that there be support in this area of the family finance be pleased about that and indeed about the cladding intervention there be welcome boost for funding for special educational need and disability and something for the dread pothole although we have yet to find out how far that funding will stretch however independent school be in peril in my constituency and their food provider staff and many other be very worried about where they will go if they be displace there be no funding in this budget to deal with such displacement would have welcome more support for the sussex wine sector be sure that you would agree with on that madam deputy speaker order that point be not about the consumption of wine have many vineyard in my constituency as the hon member do it be very important to support people work in the wine sector viticulture be alive and well in sussex essex and across the country if the train driver need have truly be satisfied the service from east grinstead to the capital simply must improve that be my plea to the southern rail service despite the leak and the pre budget announcement it come as something of shock to hear the full announcement in the budget yesterday there can be no mistake the cost to the country be very dear accord to the obr the direct and indirect cost amount to billion the new labour government can not escape the fact that in their first budget in year as they keep remind we they be set to raise taxis by staggering billion taxis will be at their high level since and that build on the winter fuel payment debacle despite labour members glee and their waving of order papers when they go back to their constituency or open their email they will see very different story their constituent like mine will face the large tax burden in our history and work people will pay the price as the chancellor have now agree let turn to young voter and those keen to get on the housing ladder stamp duty be back for first time buyer one of my conservative councillor in copthorne and worth highlight this morning that the purchase of two rental property have fall through because the margin be already very tight yesterday decision mean that two couple will now not be homeowner in handcross and pease pottage one of my councillor mr prescott mention the budget of broken promise his organisation will face cost of it will lose two people and the delivery of programme will be stop that be the reality of these decision small business often those that be woman lead such as salon will see the impact of the national insurance rise will be interested to see the effect across all sector particularly as the measure be clear breach of the labour manifesto despite labour retrospective revisionism the effect will be feel right across the land on every radio station that listen to on my way in this morning the dismay across sector affect real people life be everywhere the national insurance rise affect charity and organisation such as our hospice and air ambulance as the shadow chancellor say in the medium this morning and again here today pick the pocket of business charity and organisation be not cost free the institute for fiscal studies confirm that the rise will hit the low pay worker through low pay and the obr have say that it will hit employment so much for not raise taxis on work people two manifesto commitment have be break my constituent tell on the doorstep that their no priority be to improve the nhs if the conservative party be still in government it would be oversee steep cut across the nhs and our public service would the hon lady be happy to be part of such programme nobody here want any negative for their constituency from the budget least of all for health service however have family in wales who have be live under labour government and they know the reality of what be come down the line let build on the question have have from constituent this morning family business be directly affect local funeral director group with national reach say that it believe that the treasury have its figure wrong on the impact of the change to agricultural property relief and business property relief the cap and the rate must surely be simple mistake the group write to meet the inheritance tax bill and pay their liability firm will have to extract capital incur dividend tax rate which be above the propose rate of reduce iht give that capital gain tax be at it make no sense for family business to pass on their share to family they will simply have to sell they or their business have be implore to ask those on the treasury bench to ensure that the government consult and listen to family business at the very least the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster talk about conservative member oppose the budget we be oppose it it be anti choice anti growth anti business particularly anti family business and anti aspirational it be focus on more borrowing disgracefully as have be say it pit the public sector against the private sector happy because everybody here know that this be the ghost of labour government of the past they be back and haunt every single constituency represent rural constituency and it be clear that local farmer will be hit by the change to inheritance tax we just need to read the message from the nfu today be afraid that the subterfuge and the hoodwinking of the farming community will be feel not just by opposition members but across everybody community recently read out in westminster hall the word of local farmer whose concern be purely about business confidence at that point the same farmer write to again this week remind the house that farmer be work people and they work day and week year to say my family farm and estate be currently economically viable but there be no chance that they would ever produce sufficient cash flow to make it possible for we to cover any significant amount of inheritance tax if we be strike by excessive taxation we will no long be able to produce litre of milk per annum or timber for the nation the heritage of year could be go farmer across my constituency be stunned this be hammer blow for family business as the shadow chancellor say and we will oppose the budget it do not fix the foundation it be set of dangerous ground work call maya ellis to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker my journey here come via almost year in local government as an officer work on economic development and regeneration grow up among passionate socialist but also see the investment that small business all around put into their local area so be delighted to be make my maiden speech as the first labour mp for ribble valley in this debate on budget that truly harness the good of both social policy and great british enterprise we need both and we need they to work together for young woman full of dream and want to change the world sometimes our day to day can feel pretty restrictive place to be anyone who have feel hold back in their ambition will know that it can take just one or two people to believe in you to make all the difference to whether you carry on or give up can not possibly name all the people who help get here but you know who you be and it make all the difference that you never question for second that could do this it be so easy to quickly take for grant that we be speak in debate on budget present by the first ever woman chancellor of the exchequer she will know as well as do that as fairytale as our journey may seem at their high point right now the prejudice and obstacle that we face and that woman face every day be still far too high have say it to many woman

call two day after be select as the labour candidate do not have to spend single second handing childcare over to he he already know how to change nappy what to pack in bag and the book my child want to read at bedtime fully believe would not be stand here now if he have not take paternity leave that opportunity should not be rare forgive for speak in hetero normative context but that be my personal experience we know that few dad take up paternity or parental leave which mean that many woman can not dream of put themselves forward for political office as do know that my husband can confidently care for my child give time to think to organise and to dream too many woman be still unable to do this because their mental load fill every bit of additional brain space they have we need the idea and dream of mother and parent to propel our business our public service and our society be delighted to join the campaign organisation pregnant then screwed and the dad shift early this month to try to shift the dial on parent equality hope to see some truly ambitious step change as our government review paternity leave over this coming year not only to create new vision of

hold the fort at home and for be the foundation of my standing here today finally want to acknowledge that it take lot of bravery to be girl or young woman today it always have it be relentless scary and exhausting especially for those with caring responsibility or face additional prejudice there be million reason to give up and there be million time almost do but please do not give up can promise you this brave girl grow up and one day you might stand here and be the one in charge that be very inspirational congratulate the hon member for ribble valley maya ellis on her spirited maiden speech her speech along with the other maiden speech underline how new member come here with good will in their heart full of good intention and full of ideal it be hearten to see that in new colleague on both side of the house do not think the new labour government have any lack of good intention but this budget be happen in something of political bubble much of the chancellor discourse seem to reflect continuation of the general election campaign which we now know could have be fight more honestly openly and transparently by the labour party that say be sure the chancellor believe she have produce the good budget for this country the big cheer from the labour benches yesterday seem to be for the cut in draught beer duty but have since speak to people in the hospitality industry and they have describe this as shatter budget the money that publican and restaurateur will now have to pay their staff and pay for their staff massively dwarf any benefit they could possibly pass on to their customer from the beer duty cut in fact most of the increase beer price that we will see as result of this budget be direct consequence of the tax increase inflict on business be afraid that those cheer demonstrate complete lack of reality about the world we live in the character of this budget reflect reversion to the fail labour policy of the and it be naive to believe that tax wealth creator wealth creation and capital formation will not drive entrepreneur and business leader out of our country which be happen it be also deceive because the budget reflect that labour plan be not fully cost and it be destructive of wealth wealth creator and pension the budget massively reduce people incentive to save into their pension pot as they will now be tax on what be leave over at the end of their life to pass on to their child of course there be also streak of vindictiveness towards wealth creator hear labour member shout good when the shadow chancellor say that we be climb the league table of country with high tax rate across the economy move beyond germany the attitude that taxation be somehow an inherent good have limit and we be go beyond those limit on that point will the hon gentleman give way certainly will if it be the hon gentleman that say that indicate assent it be thank he for own up what be wrong with the german economy the german economy have consistently perform well over the past year in excess of our economy and have strong industrial strategy this government be go to produce an industrial strategy so that we can have just as strong an economy as germany and similar tax base when margaret thatcher be elect in we be the sick man of europe what she lord howe and lord lawson do to the british economy in that period put we on fast growth track than the german economy since that time we have be fall behind again this budget will help we fall behind again element of this budget be defiance of reality because behind the cheer for the cut on draught beer be the real world outside have be watch the gilt rate the year bond rate on my telephone it close yesterday at after go up substantially in the last hour of trading and now stand at over that mean the budget have spook the market into increase the cost of borrowing which the government will have to pay the idea that these measure be pain free and that get more tax revenue in and borrow more be go to bail out the economy be very flawed do not suggest there be go to be bond crisis tomorrow but we be enmesh in debt trap in this country as be so many other mature democracy after the energy crisis and covid so there be likely to be another liquidity crisis of some kind over the next few year how well prepared will this government be if they have already put up taxis and borrow to spend on more consumption rather than for our long term economic benefit this be not budget for growth apart from the initial impact of the extra spending in the forthcoming year the throttling back of expenditure then the decline in borrowing and the burden of the extra taxis suppress economic growth which the office for budget responsibility be perfectly clear about it be an empty promise for the prime minister to say we be go to prioritise economic growth this budget simply do not prioritise economic growth we have forget all the lesson of our economic history learn from the disastrous policy of the and if socialism work everyone would do it socialism do not work this be more socialist government than we have see since the they have forget what tony blair and gordon brown do it be gordon brown who cut the capital gain tax rate as chancellor gordon brown be the successor to margaret thatcher and continue with many of the same policy gordon brown do not set up ludicrous vanity project like great british energy he do not believe that take control of investment in sector like energy would increase the wealth of the country all the equivalent state own enterprise around europe lose money the government will not make return in that sector the hon gentleman mention gordon brown yesterday budget start to restore the level of government spending as share of the economy to level that be similar to those under gordon brown and the last labour government it start to restore the foundation of our public service do the hon gentleman welcome that restoration and investment wish we could all have everything that we want gordon brown inherit golden economic legacy from the conservatives in yes he do debt be fall and growth be outstrip our competitor by the time of the financial crash in he have already increase borrowing and spending the consequence of the financial crash be that he achieve what every labour government always achieve they leave office with high debt high unemployment and high inflation that be what labour government always do and that be what this labour government be set to do again rise be not go to give way any more we need only look around the world to see that the idea that an ever large state make the people rich be confound by economic experience otherwise the rich country in the world would be those with the big state it be business and free enterprise that generate the wealth that pay for the public service we need we can all recall milton friedman four way to spend money there be people own money that they spend on themselves they think about it spend it very carefully and make sure they get the maximum value for money there be money that people spend on other people such as when they buy present they may want to keep the cost down and may not be sensitive about whether the person really want particular gift or not there be somebody else money that people spend on themselves when people use expense account they go on the most expensive aeroplane or get the big car their company will pay for finally there be somebody else money that be spend on other people that be what government do it be reality that government be the bad allocator of resource for ensure future wealth creation that be just fact the record will always confirm that if we want to create more wealth the small the state can be the fast economic growth will be and the more we can afford to then spend on public service this government be profoundly un strategic just look at what the obr say about investment tax rise in this budget weigh on real income so private consumption fall as share of gdp that mean people be go to be get poor it continue corporate profit be expect to continue fall as share of gdp in the near term it add that business investment fall as share of gdp as profit margin be squeeze and the net impact of budget policy lower business investment be that good for the british economy submit not what about debt if someone have too much debt the one thing they should do be not borrow more money if they want to get out of debt member on the government benches have surgery attend by people who be in debt the one thing hon member will tell they not to do be to stack up more debt but that be what the government have choose to do that be not long term policy finally what about gdp take no pride in say that growth in gdp have be struggle for decade or more for about year yes do not think we do enough to dynamise the british economy we do not do enough but be very grateful for the support of the liberal democrats for the first five year of the conservative government that help we to keep public expenditure under well control so we could begin that process gdp per head have really be flatline we be fall significantly far behind the united states but what be the trend on these trend we will be overtake by poland by in term of gdp per head what be this government do to address the real long term trend let we look to what be the shape of public expenditure go to look like in this budget do not begin to address that what will be our national debt on long term basis what be happen to our demographic include the age population and the ratio of people in work and out of work what be this government do to address that trend and to address the immigration trend because that be add to the cost of our economy how will we be able to increase defence spending the chief of the general staff have recently say that this country could well be directly involve in war within the lifetime of this parliament we will have to spend more on defence as well as control the rest of the public sector it be many decade since health education and welfare start swamp out every other kind of expenditure in the government if we be to survive as country we will have to address these very damaging long term trend will the hon member give way if the hon gentleman will forgive be just draw to close what be the true cost of decarbonisation that be something that the government be hopelessly naive about it be as though invest in decarbonisation be somehow get out of jail free card and everybody bill will start to come down but anyone involve in the industry will say that that be not the case the need to dynamise our zombie economy be still there and be make bad by the burden that this government have inflict on we how will we re industrialise our economy when deglobalisation have take away the opportunity to import all the cheap thing that we use to make but no long do those be the real strategic challenge and the budget do not begin to address they thank you madam deputy speaker for give the opportunity to speak about how this budget be fix the foundation of our economy which could not be more important for my constituent listen with interest to the remark of the hon member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin about the last labour government let we remember that the last labour government lift child out of poverty what cost to our economy be cause by poverty rather than get people into work and secure for they the quality of life and living standard that they deserve will the hon gentleman give way of course because have just mention the hon gentleman in my speech one hon member complain about food bank actually food bank start under tony blair think that we need to share these problem and concern we need to understand each other different approach to economic policy if we be eventually to have solid approach to revive the economy of this country but be afraid that this budget do not do that there will be more poor people as result of this budget thank the hon member for his intervention in scotland we say fact be cheil that winna ding the fact of the matter be that additional child be lift out of poverty by the previous labour government and the rise and use of food bank under this administration have be exponential to the extent that now we as government be deal with food bank run out of food because of the level of poverty that we have inherit this budget will fix the foundation of our economy it will redistribute wealth tackle poverty and invest in growth that be why we can look forward to what will be achieve by this government thank to the decision take by my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer anybody look at event in scotland will see that my constituent have suffer from two government fail to deliver on investment and fail to deliver on growth their mismanagement of the public finance stand in sharp contrast to the measure that have be buy forward by my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer who have take some challenging decision on taxation to ensure that there be no return to austerity and that we can invest in growth the budget give we the chance to move on from the reckless incompetence of the tories here in westminster and of the snp in holyrood it be chance to move on from the catastrophic mini budget of liz truss budget that cause so much damage to my constituent the hon member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies conjure up image of halloween in her speech but the economic nightmare be cause by the conservative party and our constituent pay the price in their living standard those of we in scotland can not underestimate the impact of the shambolic stewardship of scotland finance by the snp it be one thing for the snp to crash the finance of its own party but quite another to crash the finance of our country the snp government have completely mishandle contract for much need new ferry other public sector project have be overspend by million while other have be delay or cancel they have also fail to spend hundred of million of pound which have be allocate to they in structural fund funding for our local authority have be slash the housing budget have be cut and the institute of fiscal studies assess that the scottish health budget face real term cut under the snp in this financial year while we know that this budget be fix the foundation so that we can deal with the reckless approach of the previous government here the snp can not simply blame everyone else for its own mistake as yet again it have attempt to do over the past hour the hon gentleman be make an excellent speech not least because he have mention both and my constituency so be grateful to he for that on that point about the snp blame everyone else he have just blame the snp and then blame we while he be look at all this guilt he should consider the merry go round operating under labour with its job for the boy perhaps he might like to address that issue think the guilt should be feel by those on the conservative benches the fact be that we have inherit billion black hole in the country finance and that have be assess independently by the obr that be how blame should be apportion be talk about matter in scotland which be sure will be of interest to the hon lady and her constituent the scottish fiscal commission state that much of the pressure in scotland come from the scottish government own decision on cut in its last budget very much welcome the additional billion that will come to scotland and our public service through this budget it be vital that the snp learn from its mistake and undo the damage that it have cause do not know where the snp members be today perhaps they be travel back to scotland in their own party campervan my constituent can not put up any long with lengthen wait for hospital treatment with find it so difficult to register for an nhs dentist and with housing crisis where so many people do not have the home they need or can not get foot on the housing ladder in my constituency there can also now be no excuse for further delay by the scottish government in construct new health centre for lochgelly the snp have promise to deliver this for over decade but have fail to do so in contrast this budget set out different vision for our public service this government will invest in home and in our school have work with the disability charity enable prior to take my seat in this place be delighted with the announcement on social care and special educational need it be astonishing to hear some member talk about our plan for wage in the social care sector they seem to imply that our hard work social care staff who play such huge role in our community should not get fair pay for that vital role that they carry out for we and for our love one the pension triple lock be protect represent constituency where there be so many former miner member of the mineworker pension scheme be live in glenrothes and mid fife be delighted that this government be ensure that more than billion owe to they will be return which will be an average of week more for each member as my hon friend the member for livingston gregor poynton highlight in his excellent maiden speech one of so many excellent maiden speech from labour members as many of my constituent benefit from this government end an injustice of the past more can look to investment in the future the budget be redistributive but it be budget for growth too boost public investment by billion over the next five year total of million be immediately be invest in gb energy headquarter in aberdeen it be extraordinary madam deputy speaker that when it come to the vote this week snp members fail to back the establishment of gb energy far from stand up for scotland the one who be actually here be sit on their hand renewable be key and grow part not only of the scottish economy but of our local economy in glenrothes and mid fife along with gb energy focus on establish scotland and the uk as green energy powerhouse the national wealth fund open up the potential for we to invest in our renewable infrastructure as we seek to secure long term future for the methil fabrication yard in my constituency investment in the facility of that yard would ensure that the strong skilled workforce can play vital role in take forward our ambition for our renewable sector the election of anas sarwar as scotland first minister will be require for my constituency to reap all the reward that the budget have set the foundation for but with billion extra for scotland in it as the scottish trades union congress have say the task now fall to the scottish government to take the decision need to invest through progressive taxation into our community and public service the westminster blame game be finish this be budget for our public service and budget to boost investment this be budget for scotland may join you madam deputy speaker and colleague across the house in congratulate the hon member for ribble valley maya ellis for livingston gregor poynton for dagenham and rainham margaret mullane and for worcester tom collins on their fantastic maiden speech we have hear that the budget be about fix the foundation of our economy as both the prime minister and the chancellor have claim if that be the case many of my constituent in epping forest will be ask what exactly will be build on those foundation and they may rightly be concern that some of that building may well be on top of our precious greenbelt at its heart when fix the foundation be promise but there be no coherent or evidence base vision to underpin it misguided budget like this one be what we end up with before go into further detail must acknowledge some of the announcement in the budget that welcome the freeze on fuel duty maintain for year by our conservative government be very welcome for my constituent who no doubt have face real worry about pay extra at the pump very much welcome the increase in send funding which be so important to support our young people with special educational need penny off pint be welcome but it be small beer for landlord who will struggle to pass it on when they be hit by the national insurance rise for employer and the reduction in business rate relief reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete have unfortunately blight number of school across my constituency so the labour government honour the previous conservative government commitment to funding rebuilding be most welcome and hope that we see action soon welcome his welcoming be sorry to repeat the word of investment in school that have raac do he agree that the time for the government to spend money on repair those school be when essex county council recognise the issue of raac in our school in have the conservative government do so we would not be in the situation that we be in now the situation with raac have build up over many year under government of all colour it be important that we stand together to sort out the problem as soon as possible so that the educational experience of our young people and the staff who teach they be improve welcome the fact that we will make progress on that and hope that we see action soon in school such as buckhurst hill community primary and roding valley high which visit just couple of week ago discuss these very issue with staff and student unfortunately however there be number of area in the budget where putative short term gain have be prioritise for little to nothing in the long term with the nhs facing pressure it be one thing to provide day to day funding but it would be very short sighted to suspend or withdraw funding for key infrastructure project that would tackle the long term issue face the nhs the rebuild of whipps cross hospital in leytonstone and the princess alexandra hospital in harlow promise by the previous conservative government and now put on hold by labour be so important for my constituent healthcare need not just today or tomorrow but in the long term while be pleased that the government have listen to by honour the conservative commitment on the new community diagnostic centre come to st margaret hospital in epping urge the government to fulfil those much need hospital rebuild to address the healthcare need of my constituent and of neighbouring constituent include the constituent of the health secretary thank the hon member for give way on two occasion would not normally intervene on speech twice but he refer to hospital in my constituency the princess alexandra although he and may have political difference welcome the opportunity to talk about the princess alexandra hospital as often as possible do he recognise that part of the delay have be cause by the funding not be there for the new princess alexandra hospital and do he recognise the work that have do in lobby the secretary of state for health and social care who have commit to new hospital but recognise the challenge because the funding be just not provide for by the previous government thank the hon member who be my neighbour for his intervention we have to get on with rebuild the princess alexandra and whipps cross and we need to do it quickly also urge the government to listen to my constituent concern about the introduction of vat on independent school fee this tax on education impact not only pupil in my constituency at independent school but our excellent local state school some family will unfortunately have to move their child midway through the school year or in the next year to some of these fantastic school some of which be already oversubscribed impact class size independent school provide social good in my constituency and right across the country provide access to high quality facility and provide access bursary for many parent independent school be choice bear out of hard work and sacrifice for some they be the good way their child with special educational need can be support amid the difficulty and delay find in the process of receive and deliver an education health and care plan once again the suppose short term gain come at the long term expense of our child future and the government must look again at reverse that punitive measure unfortunately harm aspiration flow not just through that education tax but in the measure that affect the everyday life of the work people the labour government claim to speak for if they have finally work out who work people be if someone strive to own their own business they will be force to pay increase employer national insurance contribution for have that aspiration business owner will have their business rate relief cut people who rely on the bus to get to work or appointment will be penalise by the bus fare cap increase from to we conservatives introduce the bus fare cap which help people in urban and rural community alike and we promise to deliver it for the whole of this parliament the labour government have callously rip up that lifeline bus ticket will the hon member give way no be go to carry on for pensioner aspire to live in dignity in their retirement this labour government have take away their winter fuel payment that be just immoral let say couple of word about national security it be deeply disappointing that the government be not heed call to commit to spend of gdp on defence now when we really need to show our ally and indeed our adversary where we stand nationally it seem that another area of the government lack of vision be food security and biosecurity food security be national security and biosecurity be national security over the last five year agriculture and biosecurity have face seismic shift as we have navigate our departure from the eu this be an opportunity that our previous government seize with environmental land management scheme to ensure that farmer be reward for feed we while protect our precious environment and the border target operating model to keep our food industry safe from the biosecurity risk that pose threat to both animal and human health the last thing that the sector need be to learn that it will not get the stability and support of investment that be so desperately need to state in the budget document that farm scheme and flood defence funding will be review be no way to treat our farmer and rural community we have hear lot today about agricultural property relief the change to which could devastate our farming sector risk the decimation of the sector that we rely on to feed we and support our environment the impact of the policy on family farm the tenanted sector and our food security will be untold family have have their succession planning turn on its head and that inheritance tax pressure will have profound impact on people mental health farming community face huge challenge from shock event such as flood and animal disease outbreak and chronic pressure of finance and rural isolation these be people who we know be at high risk of mental health issue and tragically suicide as well say that as veterinary surgeon profession with similar risk factor gallingly this policy decision have break the promise that labour make to our farming community the opportunity have likewise be lose in the budget to invest in the frontline of our defence against biosecurity risk the animal and plant health agency the team of our national biosecurity its headquarters in weybridge surrey need an urgent and full redevelopment as outline by the national audit office report couple of year ago with biosecurity threat such as african swine fever afflict livestock in europe avian influenza not go away and bluetongue virus bubble away in this country full funding of the headquarters in weybridge be now more urgent than ever we can not afford the devastation that biosecurity threat such as foot and mouth disease or african swine fever could wreak on our economy our farmer our food industry and rural mental health if we be not fire on all cylinder against these threat this budget claim to fix the foundation fall short in meet the everyday need of the people of epping forest and of people throughout the united kingdom this short termist budget with lack of evidence base decision making will harm our country in the long term an urgent rethink and reversal be need from those on the treasury bench and my conservative colleague will stand up for our constituent who will suffer from this anti aspirational and promise break labour budget start by commend labour members for such wonderful maiden speech this afternoon be proud to support this historic budget our new labour government be work tirelessly to deliver the change that my constituent in coatbridge and bellshill need and this budget represent an important change an important step towards fix the foundation and repair the damage cause by year of economic mismanagement and fiscal vandalism by the previous government the scale of that challenge be immense public service have be push to breaking point wage have be stagnant for far too long child poverty be on the rise and too many people in my constituency be force to work multiple job just to make end meet in scotland we have have the double whammy of two bad government just like the tories the snp have decimate our public service push our nhs to the brink and force scot to pay more to get less as my hon friend the member for glenrothes and mid fife richard baker highlight in his excellent speech the budget offer significant support to my constituent and provide record funding for scotland on top of the billion block grant the level of investment in public spending outline by my right hon friend the chancellor will generate an extra billion in barnett consequential result in the strong settlement yet for scotland in the devolution era sadly the snp government have not yet work out whether to love or loathe this budget and as my hon friend point out early snp members be not here to tell we as the scottish trades union congress highlight yesterday however the blame game be now over the snp government have the money and they must act to address the challenge impact scot the budget have also address number of fundamental injustice from the infected blood scandal to horizon and critical for the mineworker pension scheme represent mining community and as member of the coalfield parliamentary group wholly welcome the ending of this injustice and the delivery of labour manifesto commitment of more than billion to ex miner for the retire miner in the scheme in my community that will mean an increase of week in their pension end that scandalous injustice have not be short or easy undertaking and commend my predecessor and all hon and right hon member who have fight on this for many year before my time in this place also commend the government for their commitment to ensure that million will come to coatbridge in my constituency through the town fund the previous government announce that plan but their fiscal irresponsibility put it in doubt be grateful to ministers for take the time to meet to discuss these matter and delight that the million for coatbridge be now cost and will be deliver by this labour government that will allow our town board to help develop and deliver long term local plan support business and secure investment be also delighted that the budget deliver pay rise for scot increase the national minimum wage by and critically start the journey to end age discrimination banding for to year old by increase their wage by be key step as be the increase for and apprentice young people be not immune to the challenge link to the cost of live crisis and often struggle just to make end meet it be unfair that for so many of they their work their labour be value less than that of their peer simply because of their age it have to end and this labour budget have set we on course to eradicate it this be the first budget of this new labour government and it lay the foundation to deliver the change our constituent vote for serve in government be privilege it be an incredible honour that no party should take for grant it be clear from the conservatives action that their party fail to live up to that solemn duty they drive our country our constituent down dirt path of decline until they run out of road they try to mask their failing with fantasy economic and imaginary money pot and it now fall to this government to clean up their mess it be not the only mess that labour will have to clean up the snp government be equally hapless and we be count down the day to to deliver the change we need in scotland too after year of failure our labour government have set new course to restore public finance transform public service tackle poverty and raise living standard this be an honest budget which do not cynically shrink from the challenge but seek to tackle they head on budget that will deliver the change that scotland need that coatbridge and bellshill need and it should be welcome across the house the first budget of new government be always significant but one can rarely have be set in such tricky circumstance this one come follow series of major shock some of they external and unpredictable as opposition members have say such as the covid pandemic and the energy crisis but some of they down to policy decision such as the brexit deal and the mini budget it also sit in the long shadow of the financial crisis and over decade worth of cut to public service growth have be stubbornly sluggish the cost of living have erode people wage and as tax as proportion of our national income have tick up the capability of many to contribute more have diminish the result of all of this be that our public service be under strain our public finance be under strain and the british public be under strain it be in that context that try offer constructive opposition to the budget today point out what agree with what do not and where think it can be well healthcare be the big issue for my constituent so will start there at first glance it look like we have big injection of cash into the nhs that be relief have previously warn about the counterproductive nature of further austerity and be cautiously optimistic that we might escape it in this area but the rate at which the cash be be inject alongside the speed at which it drop off present question about how well it can be spend and what the hangover from this sugar rush might be that require further scrutiny on capital expenditure more broadly be glad that we be wake up to the real calculation that need to be make by seek to borrow to invest in vital infrastructure make my maiden speech on second reading of the budget responsibility bill and take that opportunity to encourage change to the fiscal rule that be exactly the kind of geekery that you will get from madam deputy speaker now that sit on the treasury committee next week will go into more detail on or public sector net financial liability and so on but will spare the house of that today overall be pleased to see move in that direction say overall because in my maiden speech use the example of rebuild my local hospital as the perfect no brainer project that could be unlock by great willingness to borrow to invest st helier hospital be old than the nhs itself and some part of the estate be literally crumble and desperately need investment in major work and new building so be disappoint that we do not even receive great assurance about the progression of that project hope that the health secretary will soon return to the chamber with further announcement the other big gap in the chancellor budget be on social care as my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey say yesterday it be still undeniably the elephant in the waiting room without address social care any investment in the nhs will be fundamentally flawed billion of pound will pour in but it will be undermine by the failure to get people who would be well treat at home out of hospital of course that have knock on impact on local authority fear that the million put forward yesterday to support council on social care will be spread too thinly especially when factor in the impact of the national minimum wage and employer nic so ask the government to consider extend the public sector exemption to the care sector the budget mean that council that be already on the brink be go to have to make some pretty unpalatable cutback just to survive it mean that the mismatch between what taxpayer pay and the local service they receive will get bad hope that we get much great clarity next year on local government funding my final point on the nhs relate to its potential to get our economy go again far too many people be economically inactive because of ill health that place huge strain on our welfare budget and if we be honest we do not really have enough datum on what be drive it be worried that the labour government think that it be because we have suddenly become nation of shirker there be tough talk yesterday of carry over the tory plan to get more punitive on work capability assessment chase down benefit cheat might go down well with some newspaper but that kind of demonisation of the sick be both shameful and ineffective let point to just one example my dad proud scaffolder for most of his life have work his sock off from monday to saturday every week but he be now in his late and that kind of work be not easy he start have trouble walk and have have to stop work and it take month to get diagnosis when he finally find out that he have hip problem the nhs basically tell he to come back in year because it could not treat he until then he ask what he be suppose to do about work and be tell that he would have to sign off sick do member think that my dad enjoy do that he hat it he be proud work man be deny the opportunity to work if the nhs could fix he today he would be back in work tomorrow here be my big bet there be far more people like my dad than there be the benefit cheat that labour focus on yesterday so let we have some compassion and focus on what will really get people back into work before bring my remark to close will touch on two big element that plan to take up far on the treasury committee the first be tax want the country to start more honest conversation about tax know what some labour member will be think but the liberal democrats set out in our manifesto billion worth of tax and spend proposal because we know that public service desperately need the cash injection the labour manifesto propose only billion in tax rise but yesterday we be present with an increase of billion be willing to accept that black hole be leave behind but those number do not add up the conservatives propose tax cut in their manifesto and at the previous budget but it turn out that they be not base on realistic figure either tax be always something to be hit by in politic always deem punishment instead of contribution it leave in tatter the debate about what fair distribution of tax be and trust in politic plummet as result we all need to do much well my other point be about growth we have have month of hear this budget be pitch as one of growth yet the obr think that its effect will be broadly flat at least over the forecast period the conversation around how to achieve growth must get much more serious growth in gdp very specific measure should not be the sole way in which we evaluate the country success and someone who believe that it should must at least recognise that growth have not only rate but direction and it up to we in this place to set that direction finally be advise recently that the key way to critique the budget be to look out for the big number in the red book that the chancellor do not mention well will save that but will highlight small number that the chancellor do not mention million to trial kinship care allowance move into the care of my grandparent as teenager and they would have be immensely grateful for that support so welcome the trial and hope that it be roar success thank the hon member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean for his comment about kinship allowance which will address in due course because it be helpful when we have constructive opposition however he talk about the difficulty of obtain nhs treatment and remind he of the five year that the liberal democrats spend work alongside the conservatives to bring about cut to our nhs the police and many other vital service will leave it at that congratulate my right hon friend the chancellor on the budget which be clearly the start of new chapter towards make britain well off can see clearly how it link into our labour target of secure the high sustained growth in the as well as into our other mission of have an nhs fit for the future and break down barrier to opportunity it be clear that there be strategy for achieve aspiration and provide people with support those two thing can truly combine to make our country great one measure that will affect my congleton constituency be the work that will now continue at pace for hospital affect by the raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete crisis include leighton hospital in crewe which serve many of my constituent the hospital still have paper note it do not have an electronic record system the major reason for that be that it have spend over million in the past few year just on prop up its wall that kind of failure spend to sustain the hospital most basic physical infrastructure mean that the investment to make the nhs fit for the future can not be make look forward to be part of government who enable we do the sort of forward think work in which we stop make short term decision that simply prevent people from have access to the care that they need we must work in rational manner people in the nhs include doctor and nurse in my constituency will be grateful that we be move in that direction the nhs have be break but the budget will begin to fix it our social care system have also face significant challenge in recent year again this budget begin to fix that alongside the million in grant support for local authority be so pleased to hear about the million increase in the disability facility grant which will enable we to support more home adaptation as think we all know people want to stay in their home for as long as possible and it be our duty as government to facilitate that similarly be pleased to see the uplift in the state pension through the triple lock which will enable more than per year to be give to many pensioner across the country we be also go to see the big ever cash increase in the earning threshold for carer allowance mean that many more thousand of carer in my constituency can increase their income which be so important for people dignity and many more people will be able to access carer allowance for the first time also want to say an enormous thank you to the kinship carer in my constituency those grandparent old sibling aunt and uncle extended family member and family friend who be look after child they will welcome the announcement of million to support kinship and foster carer include through the new kinship allowance trial speak of child turn now to school school across the country be crumble raac school specifically have hit the headline but there be many other fundamental structural problem in many of our school school that be decimate overnight by the previous government scrapping of the building schools for the future programme this budget will begin to fix those problem with billion allocate to deliver classroom that child can learn and thrive in and billion increase in the core school budget to support the recruitment of new teacher it will also enable we to properly fund pay rise for the public sector which be so important for retain the experienced teacher on whom we rely be delighted that billion of that billion increase will go towards fix our special educational need system and system for disabled child within education it be so important that we get that right parent in my constituency and their child be desperately reliant on we for it our childcare system have also be struggle which have have huge implication for parent ability to go to work this budget will begin to fix that by allocate billion to continue the expansion of government fund childcare which will help people to stay in and return to work more than quarter of child in my constituency of congleton live in relative poverty after housing cost the roll out of free breakfast club in primary school be very welcome measure to help struggle family moreover the increase in the national minimum wage will have an enormous impact on family and on child poverty some of child in this country who be grow up in poverty live in family with at least one work parent it be low wage that be cause those problem and be very pleased that we be address they our road have also be break by year of austerity and again this budget will begin to fix they the investment of million to fix an additional million pothole per year be good start driver in my constituency will welcome that investment as well as the continue fuel duty freeze of course business will welcome many of the step in the budget as well while we be increase the national living wage to support worker we be also support small business through an increase in the employment allowance fair business rate start up loan growth hub and the new national wealth fund small business in my constituency will also welcome the funding the chancellor have commit to tackle shoplifting which affect all of our shopping bill and be worth billion of pound to the economy every year shopkeeper in my constituency recently tell and the cheshire police and crime commissioner dan price that they have give up on try to report shoplift in many instance because it be simply not good use of their time be so pleased that we will begin to address this issue we be begin to get the fundamental right under the last government there be so many productive cut that undermine our national productivity this budget do not stand alone as one off event rather it be part of coherent set of plan to ensure that our public service be reform and that we be able to develop cross departmental working in government and deliver what work people need to have good quality of life an nhs that be there when they need it and work that pay look forward to work with businesspeople and family in my constituency to ensure that we get the delivery of those plan right over time but right now this budget look like solution that will begin to fix the nhs and social care rebuild hospital and school fix the send system and rebuild confidence in our public service in the economy and in our future as country be pleased to follow the hon member for congleton mrs russell it be enlightening for to listen to she because she list huge array of thing on which the government be now go to be spend lot more money they be all very good cause of absolute benefit to the people of our country the one problem have listen to she and to all the labour members be that we do not have any money leave we have spend it all we have to spend half trillion pound on the pandemic but notice that no one have mention that we be in effect run on tick we be live beyond our mean we be spend money we do not have and all we be do laudable though it may be to spend the money we be discuss today be hand huge debt to future generation have to remind labour members that every labour government we have ever have in my lifetime have leave this country with high debt more unemployment and an economy in bad state would also remind they that it be in after year of fail socialist government that we finish up have to rebuild the economy under prime minister who have the determination to do what be right for our country and those economic reform lead to year of prosperity it sound as though the hon member be give up on britain he seem to be say that there be no point in try to find well future for ourselves because there be no money leave and the previous labour government leave no money would he recognise that the level of debt leave in this country at the end of the recent conservative administration be twice what be leave by the labour government in the hon member forget about the pandemic and its associate cost the reality be that we have to create the wealth before we spend it for many year have hear labour members talk about how to spend money very rarely hear how we actually create the wealth we need to spend on our public service and that be where it all go wrong will the hon member give way no will not give way the chancellor yesterday paint dire picture of our country future under labour it be not the economy that be boom but the size of the state with an ever increase burden of taxation on work people under this government it be not the businessman in my constituency of romford who be be support with the future success of their enterprise but the climate alarmist with public energy company that will not even produce any energy how sensible be that it be not the young family in area such as collier row or the pensioner in rush green both in my constituency who be be support by for example decrease in stamp duty or help with energy payment but of course the union boss who be able to deliver over inflated pay rise to the public sector and the private sector be once again pay for that despite the government talk of growth this budget be prepare we for the return of the dark day of the with hard work people pay the price indeed the government be so lacking in aspiration for this country that they want the office for budget responsibility not only to mark their work but it seem to to do their homework completely they be even gift the obr more power as be outline in the king speech in my view britain potential be far great than high tax low growth and dysfunctional big state far from my give up on britain as the hon member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae say quite the opposite love this country believe in this country and hate to see what socialism have do to this country over the year labour government always end up in bad situation than when they start and conservative government always have to come in and pick up the piece and restore the economy back to prosperity and vibrancy again in five year time be sure we will have to do the same it be now clear that under this labour government the british people face tyranny of taxation not content with the record break tax burden that already exist labour be add to the load on the shoulder of hard work people under labour it will be hard than ever to buy property the journey to work of my constituent in romford who be lucky enough to own their own home be go to be even more expensive than it be already under the control of the mayor of london mr khan with the rise in bus fare once they get to work my constituent will have far less in their pay packet because the increase in national insurance pay by employer will of course clearly be pass on to employee it be nothing but stealth tax by this supposedly transparent labour government and it be job destroy business in my constituency have already be tell that they will not be employ people because of this reckless increase in national insurance my constituent all our constituent might even lose their job interruption they will lose their job as business struggle with the national insurance increase the cost of that will be phenomenal and the growth crush increase in capital gain tax will also have big impact as if that be not enough when someone sadly pass away the labour government want to make it even hard for they to pass on what they have earn throughout their life to their loved one by expand inheritance tax to pension and so on that be incredibly cruel people pay tax throughout their life and will pay more tax when they die be that really the kind of thing labour government should be do it will harm lot of family who would inherit but will not be able to because of the cash grab from this budget do not believe that the government be pro worker at all they can not even define what worker be labour use to be the party of the state from cradle to grave now it seem to be the party of tax my essex constituent from cradle to grave and beyond this have be very essex weight debate with contribution from my hon friend the members for epping forest dr hudson and for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale the hon member for harlow chris vince and other people in my county of essex be very disillusioned by all this because they be aspirational and hard work they be market trader and small business people they will be devastate by all this warn labour members that they will find that out when they next knock on door in their constituency as margaret thatcher warn well she do rescue our country economy let be honest about it interruption she really do and we be still benefit today from the reform that she introduce as margaret thatcher say any government who impose high taxation be take power away from the people and give themselves power over the people of course taxation at some level be always necessary it have to be in place to support our nation armed force to support family and protect pensioner and for investment in necessary infrastructure and public service for the future but what be the labour government do with all the hard earn money that the work people of this country have create think they will be spend billion of pound on thing that will go to waste do the hon gentleman not think that there be quite lot of waste under the previous government there be dodgy personal protective equipment contract that do not result in money be spend on ppe be that the sort of waste our government should claw back have to say that agree with the hon gentleman the last government waste huge amount of no they do no wonder we lose the election but this be not political point this be about how we run the country effectively and efficiently my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex make range of serious point about how we be go to survive as country we can not keep spend money like this it do not work and future generation will suffer because of it the last government fail but this government be go way far this be all simply unaffordable and worry about the future of our country if we can not see where this will eventually lead the labour government be spend billion of pound on renewable energy company that will not produce any energy another vanity project they be spend billion of pound on public sector wage hike and be pour even more taxpayer money into public service with virtually no concrete productivity target do the hon gentleman accept that those pay rise will go to hard work people who be themselves taxpayer look we have to live within our mean of course do not object to money be spend wisely and sensibly it be the role of any government to ensure that the money we spend go where it be really need in our country the problem have be that all this be unaffordable we be about of our gdp in debt that be the high that debt have be in our entire history we can not go on do this eventually it will all come crash down and every hon member who let it happen without speak out as be do today will have to take responsibility when future generation have to pick up the piece we can not afford the debt we be get into if hard work people be be tax they rightly expect the money to be put to good use to boost infrastructure we should focus on local service and economic growth not ideological consumption again the people of romford and throughout the borough of havering and the county of essex will be rightly outraged that there be so much unfairness especially in local government funding the funding formula have not be address in the budget from what can see that be serious issue in the london borough of havering where my constituency be base despite this be the great example of tax and spend that can remember since have be member of parliament nothing have be do to address that very serious problem the funding formula be unfair outdated and discriminatory it fail to address local demographic shift local people business and public service be the bedrock of our economy they face acute financial pressure in my constituency they deserve an ambitious programme of reform so that the money we pay in can be spend on our local service instead of we close down library and facility which my council be sadly now do necessarily because of lack of funding it be question of priority my local council should not close library but at the end of the day we be not be fund fairly and the government need to address that if local service be not provide people will be angry and disillusioned and local community will be harm speak not only for essex and the surround london borough but for all hard work people the length and breadth of this country when say that the united kingdom have no place be high tax low growth and low aspiration nation if the chancellor want growth encourage she to look to nation whose economy be expand much fast than our be due to under the sluggish and rather depress growth forecast she outline yesterday the formula for some of those country be the same whether they be in north america asia or europe low taxis that give people back the money that be rightly theirs policy that incentivise enterprise and growth in the economy and lean state with minimal regulation investment in infrastructure be critical and truly local public service be vital to people they also create basis for private investment in britain cut red tape and reap the benefit of brexit we really should do that will attract booming business and stimulate success the mantra that the state should manage decline need to be reject the british people deserve well than this encourage the government to follow not the example of fail labour governments litter throughout history but the nation save policy embark on in by prime minister who have vision of great britain and more prosperous united kingdom we must pursue an agenda of low taxis economic growth and an efficient state that improve the public service that look after the elderly and those truly in need the people of this country do not want and simply can not afford return to red blooded socialism that discriminate against hard work people decimate our economy destroy job curtail growth and restrict freedom the british people need small state that work not bloated state that hold our country back it be an honour to follow the hon member for romford andrew rosindell even though fundamentally disagree with everything that he say know that he will take that in the right spirit congratulate all colleague who make their maiden speech the speech be fantastic and move and wish they all really wonderful time in this parliament and hope parliaments to come progressive governments be judge on whether they deliver high standard and welcome the direction of travel that our first woman chancellor take yesterday it be good to hear that for the first time the cost of living will be take into account when calculate the national minimum wage also welcome the step towards single adult wage rate with to year old receive increase hope that those kind of revision will continue those be valuable example of the change that labour government will make to low income household key feature of this budget be that it can safeguard exist job in the north east and help to create new well pay job for the people represent one of the big sector in our north east industrial base be the offshore energy sector that is oil and gas company that work in the north sea and the associate supply chain we be proud to have those job in my constituency and we must anchor they here in the uk and avoid their be attract overseas last year in newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend the offshore sector add million in gross value add and support thousand of job that be just snapshot from the region where the sector contribute million and more than good job overall be pleased that my right hon friend the chancellor recognise the reality that oil and gas will be essential to our economy and for energy security for decade to come especially give that if we misstep we will simply have to rely on import which be more expensive have high carbon footprint and do not deliver any tax yield this government have commit to ensure that the north sea be manage in way that do not jeopardise job and continue to attract necessary investment with the delivery of net zero and energy transition be an exciting prospect successful home grow energy transition have the potential to deliver the economic growth that the country need know that the oil and gas sector and its representative body offshore energies uk find yesterday budget encouraging they be grateful for the positive engagement from the secretary of state the chancellor of the exchequer and the exchequer secretary over the summer they recognise that the energy profit levy serve purpose but the commitment to look at unwind it and to find new permanent regime can give company and investor the confidence that they need to invest in our uk look forward to help ministers succeed but will of course also hold they to account will also hold the industry to account on its commitment to support worker deliver fair transition and provide retrain and working standard for all the trade union be keen and willing to play their part offshore energies uk estimate that with the right investment environment uk offshore energy company could invest billion in home grow energy this decade alone support the uk to reach gw of wind and gw of hydrogen reduce reliance on oil and gas and allow we to scale up to at least four carbon capture and storage cluster by an exciting prospect indeed move away from the economy and on to local government welcome the real term increase in spending on send and alternative provision the send system be break in my constituency child have be hold back from flourish and reach their true potential the million to help plug deficit be movement in the right direction urge the chancellor to build on that move into the spending review in the spring today longbenton councillor karen clark have be select as labor candidate for the north tyneside mayoral election karen welcome the chancellor historic budget and look forward to promote its promise investment for local government during her forthcoming campaign on social security the reduction in the deduction cap will help to minimise the financial impact of debt repayment with those benefit keep an extra year it be smart fiscally neutral way to help reduce negative household budget and raise living standard however the commitment to deliver the conservative plan to reform the work capability assessment and to deliver the inherit saving have worry many with limited capability for work and work relate activity hope the house will be give time to examine and debate that when the proposal be outline in great detail as the chair of the responsible vaping all party parliamentary group have concern about the announce tax on vape liquid from there be still million smoker who have yet to make the switch to vaping and tax on vaping will only serve to discourage those smoker to quit the vaping tax propose by the chancellor be unsustainably high at per ml of vape liquid it will make the uk tax one of the high in europe the tax will also hurt work people throughout the north east who rely on vape to keep they off cigarette currently many store sell vaping liquid for refillable device for under the chancellor proposal that will increase by to access to vape liquid be not drive youth vaping the government be already look to address that through the tobacco and vapes bill fear that the tax on vape will hurt people who have make the decision to switch from smoke to the less harmful alternative decision that have already save the nhs ten of thousand of pound per person yesterday budget have renew the hope of ordinary people that the future can be different labour budget for low income household work people and child our public service can be rebuild living standard can begin to turn around and our politic can deliver progress again it have be real privilege to share the debate with so many maiden speech this afternoon something do not expect my hon friend the member for ribble valley maya ellis be not in her place just now but be sure her father would have be proud of she as will her husband have fantastic charity in my constituency call dads rock which support dad and give they confidence it sound like her husband be dad who rock it have be remarkable that margaret thatcher have be invoke quite few time it be quite unusual for her name to be mention so many time in my presence grow up in fife during the and be sure my hon friend the member for glenrothes and mid fife richard baker would agree that the impact that she have there be still feel today people still feel the impact of the rapid deindustrialisation of proud community be sure that my hon friend have casework still about the impact of that it be emotional yesterday to hear the chancellor deliver her fantastic speech be still little hoarse today from all the emotion this be the budget our country need and the imf agree which be incredible it be great news for labour mps to wake up to this morning expect colleague from other party be less happy the chance of my be elect be always slim but promise those meet on the campaign trail that labour would get our country back on track yesterday budget be proof that we be serious about that we have spend the week since the election clearing up the mess which be leave by other but the budget set down the foundation for what we want to do next it be transformative budget can not believe we be achieve so much in our first budget but it be only the start of real change for our country the budget will work for both the work people who call edinburgh south west home but also the young and retire people who deserve well fund public service the measure that we set out yesterday be re set establish the tone for the remainder of this parliament and for the come decade not just five year go be the irresponsible commitment without plan to follow through that we have be deal with since the election it feel like the grown up be now run the country we have budget that provide the stability to encourage growth and investment in our nation infrastructure and our public service after read through the detail of the budget it be clear that when my colleague anas sarwar say read my lip no austerity under labour he mean it the chancellor have deliver the budget will deliver for the people of scotland with record break billion for the scottish government budget in that have the potential to be entirely life change not just for my constituent but for people right across scotland the chancellor yesterday prove that when labour win scotland win with the measure announce result in more investment per head of population in scotland than in the rest of the uk the scotland office be now equip with budget for trade mission around the world sell brand scotland and bring in new investment and custom to countless scottish business some of the lowest pay scot will also feel the benefit in their payslip we will close the age band on the living wage which have always be unacceptable the budget have protect work scot and have lay the foundation for new era of investment and growth in scotland raise money from those with the broad shoulder with all that in mind find it rather embarrass that snp members talk with straight face about this be an austerity budget it be almost as if they write their speech before they hear the budget it be quite curious can only guess as other have comment none of they be here today that they be busy rewrite their line and think about how they be go to respond but think lot of people in scotland will find it unacceptable that no snp members be here today to engage in this debate be it not time when the uk labour government have give the scottish government their large ever fund settlement that the snp begin to take responsibility for its own mismanagement of scotland finance in government the snp have waste million on pet project rather than the service on which so many scot rely we have have ferry with paint window as speak hospital in edinburgh be be close as an emergency action because of lack of maintenance this be not small hospital the princess alexandra eye pavilion cater for out patient per week and it have be close almost overnight it be plan process but one that have be force it be absolutely incredible and shameful in parallel with that local authority have be starve of cash and our town and city have find their public service decimate on tuesday meet third sector group in my constituency who be prepare to make staff redundant due the pressure of snp cut to social care at past yesterday just as the chancellor be get ready to speak receive whatsapp message from gp serve one of the most deprived part of my constituency she describe the cut to social care service in edinburgh as catastrophic and devastating at quarter past last night receive an email from gp make exactly the same point the snp will blame westminster or howl austerity but in reality that be mince that be scottish phrase madam deputy speaker the scottish government own decision be to blame for much of the pressure face scotland finance that be not just my view but the consider view of the official economic forecaster in scotland the budget present the scottish government with choice they can use the record funding to own the problem that they create and get our public service back on track include the social care service talk about the only alternative to that be hand over power to anas sarwar in scotland because more guddle can not be an option but fear that that be what we be go to get if the snp be not up for that challenge scottish labour be ready to step in my constituent know more than most the impact of the snp cut and mismanagement because edinburgh scotland capital have the worst fund local authority in scotland with this additional funding it be high time that the scottish government do the right thing and stop starve our council of the resource it need councillor cammy day edinburgh council leader make that demand yesterday let we hope that the funding will be lifeline to social care provider in scottish voter will have the opportunity to elect scottish labour government that will work hand in hand with this uk labour government to continue to deliver for the people of scotland however until then we scottish labour mps and our colleague at holyrood and in council chamber will hold the scottish government to account for how they choose to spend the additional funding after all think we can all agree that the scottish government have not just need more cash they have need to get well at spend it we see yesterday what labour chancellor can do to turn around the life of work people even in the face of shocking legacy hand to we by the conservatives this government have give the scottish government all the financial tool they need to succeed just imagine how truly transformative it would be if we have scottish labour finance secretary work in partnership with labour chancellor here in london that be our goal it have be pleasure to listen to so many excellent maiden speech this afternoon and to hear so many colleague say such positive word about budget that be excited to support every single member on these labour benches represent mandate mandate we be give by the british people when they vote for change on july they do not just vote for labour members to sit on these benches and continue the last government fail policy of austerity and decline on july people vote for real change be delighted to say that this budget have set we on path that will change our country for the well it begin the process of fix the foundation of our broken economy it set in motion the investment need to deliver change and it remain steadfast that no work person will see high taxis in their payslip the country know that the conservative party fail we with cost of living crisis shoddy brexit deal and dreadful mini budget that fracture our economy and work family in town like halesowen feel its failure hard people across my constituency have share countless story of their struggle to cope with their bill go up their wage stagnate and no help from the government the last parliament be the first in modern history to leave living standard low at its end than they be at its start people have be exasperate with our public service they have watch relative wait month and year for nhs treatment see their local service close and see the public infrastructure crumble around they they be tired tired of live under government that do not deliver on their commitment tired of see our public service get bad year after year and tired of wait for government that would bring about genuine last change yesterday be proud to listen to the chancellor as she set out the plan to change our country be delighted to hear her focus on fix the foundation of our economy on real investment in our public service and rightly on put the burden on those with the broad shoulder with each announcement begin piece together what the budget will mean for our community in halesowen it deliver real difference for those most in need of help increase in the national living wage put more in the pocket of retail worker pub staff and many other an increase of the carer allowance earning limit to week carer charity in my constituency such as we love carers have say that that will make vital difference to carer by allow people on really low income to earn that little bit extra to support their family and billion investment in our nhs meet our promise to bring wait time down to no long than week just as they be under the last labour government however what be most pleased by be the funding for our town centre and local community it pain to say it but our high street have struggle in recent year have see many independent shop close and our community centre be really struggle so be delighted that the government be provide billion to support our high street and community and the infrastructure that will support people across halesowen that include million to regenerate halesowen town centre and an additional million to redevelop haden hill leisure centre in cradley heath both be really important project that be promise under the last government but no funding be provide so be delighted to see

of chaos seven chancellors and fiscal event but not one of they deliver thing opposition mp after opposition mp wherever they have go welcome investment and say want new hospital want this and that but not one of they have an idea about how to pay for it yesterday be proud to sit and listen to chancellor who be be honest with the british people about the mess that be leave what we will spend the improvement that we will make and how we be go to pay for they that be what change yesterday as we hear the first female chancellor deliver the first labour budget in year and what budget it be it boost public investment by over billion and maintain the fuel duty freeze and cut which be vital for family and small business in dunfermline and dollar and across scotland and the rest of the united kingdom alongside that the budget support the take up of electric vehicle and abolish non dom tax loophole raise billion it increase extended and reform the energy profit levy as we promise to do and kick start gb energy which be headquarter in aberdeen to deliver the clean energy and green job that we will need in the future despite gb energy be describe by conservative members as vanity project it will deliver the infrastructure that this country need which they fail to deliver in year we have increase the employment allowance for small business to as someone who use to run small business know how well that will be receive we have preserve the state triple lock on pension which will see over million pensioner gain up to next year we have provide an uplift of million for the defence budget while maintain billion in annual support for ukraine for as long as it take as have be mention by my hon friend this uk labour government will deliver total of billion in scotland the large settlement in the history of devolution that include an additional billion for the scottish government this financial year and an additional billion next year it be bonanza of expenditure lot of money be be spend the hon gentleman say early that he would explain how it will be pay for just for clarification will he please explain where all this money be come from and how we be go to pay off the debt in the long term believe the chancellor outline all of that absolutely perfectly yesterday would never seek to improve on the performance of our fantastic chancellor from whom we hear just yesterday whereas the rest of the uk have only have to endure year of the conservatives incompetence we in scotland have suffer even more we have have year of the snp blame the tories for its own economic incompetence and decision we have have year of two fail government who have be content to play political game rather than come to the help of the people of scotland my hon friend be make an excellent speech follow yesterday budget there will be significant increase in investment in further education which be critical to deliver the skill revolution that we need in scotland further education have be decimate by the snp government do he agree that they need to recognise the important step take by the chancellor and follow suit my hon friend make an excellent point as and other member from fife know we be celebrate the year anniversary of fife college will attend college dinner this week and will make exactly that point to those attend further education be critical in provide the skill that scotland need as say yesterday during scotland question in relation to the defence sector we need to ensure that the investment be provide by this government be well use in scotland to develop the skill that we need we have have year of two fail government but that time be come to an end it will truly end only in may when the people of scotland have the opportunity to elect scottish labour government but before the snp exit stage right although snp members seem to have exit the chamber during this debate urge it to use the record funding wisely and start deliver for the people of scotland the snp government must abandon their austerity programme of cut to public service and focus on their pet project as they have go along they might be on their way out the door but the least they owe the people of scotland be not to leave the same kind of mess as their partner in constitutional distraction the tories have leave for the rest of the uk that include project such as the kincardine health centre in my constituency like the health centre mention by my hon friend the member for glenrothes and mid fife richard baker that have be delay by more than decade after be promise by the snp alongside the good news we hear the chancellor outline the mess and legacy leave after year of conservative government who make announcement with no fund allocate among the empty promise from the conservative members be the million of cultural funding promise to the city of dunfermline in my constituency while it be absolutely clear that the blame for that lie with the previous government it be none the less disappointing for the city of dunfermline that the government have be force to consult on and review the funding dunfermline be an old city and the historic capital of scotland but it be officially award city status only in it be grow city which have the potential to be the drive force for the economy of scotland to achieve that however we need the right investment and support as the consultation on cultural funding be under way prior to the budget also write to the chancellor of the exchequer ask for assistance and support to find small amount of investment for the port of rosyth in my constituency to enable new regular passenger and freight service between scotland and the continent with major local employer such as mowi and amazon uk in the area ferry service to europe would far strengthen their position as major contributor to the fife economy and provide the option of more environmentally friendly logistic by remove truck journey from the road both the previous uk conservative government and the current snp scottish government have talk about support that project but neither have be willing to make the necessary investment have be fail by the previous government promise money that they do not have will minister meet and other behind these plan to find way of perhaps fund that commitment yesterday we truly turn the page on year of tory austerity and have give the uk and scotland the chance to grow and succeed again will be the proud member of parliament to support this budget which fix the foundation of our country and set we on path to prosperity and growth in the future it be privilege to rise as dartford first labour mp for year to welcome the first labour budget for year but before do so pay tribute to those who have make their maiden speech this afternoon they have be inspire and personal and member have talk about their journey and lovingly about their constituency thank member for those and congratulation on they dartmouth like much of the country be at crossroad after more than decade of conservative failure with our economy stagnate and our public service break and unable to be the safety net that my constituent need labour members be elect on promise of change and yesterday budget deliver that with hugely welcome focus on investment to get our economy move set the foundation for growth and begin to fix our school our hospital and our broken road it be astonishing to hear conservative member after conservative member say how they wish to see public service improve in their constituency without will any mean to pay for it the hon member for romford andrew rosindell for example seem to want european level of public service on american level of taxation that be not possible but this government be achieve european level public service support by european level taxation bear by those with the broad shoulder the chancellor be absolutely right that we must grow our economy nowhere be this truer than in the thames estuary which have the potential to be one of the uk engine of growth with million new job million new home and billion worth of additional value add by in this parliament hope to work with mps on both side of the house and from across the estuary region as well as with ministers to make real progress work be already under way on establish an all party parliamentary group on the thames estuary which will work with ministers on the fair growth agenda set out by the government sponsor thames estuary growth board for the small number of people who have follow my short parliamentary career to date it will come as no surprise to learn that believe that key shovel ready piece of infrastructure the low thames crossing will be crucial to our investment in the estuary currently we have only one road crossing of the thames east of london at dartford single point of failure that can not only block crucial freight movement across the country but make the life of dartford resident misery due to the gridlock this project could start very quickly with the planning process already undertake and delivery team already in place in short order it would create job across the local area and help we to unlock the large bottleneck in the uk look forward to work with the chancellor and her colleague across government to secure the necessary finance to get this project start dartford be lucky to have district general hospital at dare nt valley where the staff work with dedication every day to support our local population however after year of conservative government waiting list be far too high and the accident and emergency unit lack the capacity to see people quickly the late figure indicate that more than resident be await treatment with more than third waiting long than week the chancellor announcement of billion over two year for the nhs to cut waiting time through extra elective appointment and additional capacity should help to bring down these waiting list the recent darzi report on the nhs highlight the need to be far more creative in how we keep people healthy over the long term by build prevention into the system hope that ministers will recognise the opportunity for people to get involve in community activity that help they to lead more active healthy life as emphasise in this budget there be more work to do on tackle health inequality as these opportunity be not evenly spread across the country on the subject of prevention particularly welcome the proposal to review the sugar tax and to consider its extension to milk base drink would like to see this consideration extend to other product include food that be high in salt fat and sugar an obese nation can not be healthy nation finish by touch on an area of personal importance to six year ago my mother be diagnose with dementia after her memory begin to fail be proud that thank to the nhs she have receive high quality care and continue to lead high quality of life as former local government cabinet member for health work across nhs and council boundary know that be very often not the case we can make life well for those who like my mother be diagnose with dementia by ensure early and accurate diagnosis so the condition can be well manage with the right treatment and those who have be diagnose and their family can prepare for the care they need hope ministers will use the extra investment to look at how we can make that happen within the nhs dartford resident will welcome two other set of critical measure in the chancellor speech like colleague from across the house know from my many conversation with parent of child with special educational need how inadequate and break the provision be across the uk and in kent on top of the significant increase for school and further education the new billion announce yesterday will add resource to the review of send announce by the secretary of state for education also welcome the step the chancellor have take to tackle crime and to make people feel safe on our street across the country our sense of security have be erode with level of antisocial behaviour and shoplifting that be far too high this budget will put we on the road to deliver our manifesto pledge to boost visible neighbourhood policing with more neighbourhood officer and police

the previous government retailer and staff live in fear of the individual and organise gang that target they the additional funding to tackle that and provide more training to our police officer and

passion project to ensure that this centre add to our national cultural life the british library in the north be situate in my neighbouring constituency of leeds south just few hundred yard from my own constituency and it receive very similar news hope that we can meet the relevant ministers in both the treasury and the department for culture media and sport to ensure that these project do not flounder under the false promise of the previous government like many other colleague be also pleased about the funding commitment for special educational need meet so many parent who can not even find place in an appropriate school for their sen child some have to travel many mile to be able to get the education that they deserve the billion funding promise yesterday which be above inflation

since but understand from letter that she have receive that west yorkshire will be include in the integrate settlement in two year ahead of schedule if we look at previous integrate settlement that

be support this budget congratulate all my colleague who have make brilliant maiden speech today as always be take aback by the range of experience and expertise in this house have plan to be radical and speak very briefly about few matter that be particular to the north west but before do so have to pick up on some issue raise by conservative members first the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale make seemingly unequivocal statement that business face increase in payroll have only two choice open to they to reduce their workforce or increase price that be patently untrue business increase payroll all the time for perfectly good business reason we can not be so simplistic in our analysis far more important for business be have the right infrastructure and skilled workforce who be able to get good healthcare and support all thing that the budget will provide another conservative member who would not take an intervention draw the tired analogy between household budget and national budget they be not the same it be that sort of rubbish that get we in this mess in the first place finally there be several reference to short term growth forecast conservative members be either unaware of or wilfully ignore the fact that there be lag between good infrastructure investment and meaningful sustained growth the decision that we be take now be long term decision the sort of decision that previous government duck these decision will deliver sustained growth in four five six or seven year which will make real sustained difference to the country not short term sugar rush growth for political gain let focus now on the north west like much of the country outside the home county the north west be badly let down by the cut and false promise of the previous government so

set to benefit from million over year will be excited to work with local leader to develop innovative implementation plan look forward to the development of ambitious regional growth and investment plan that will unlock the true potential of our area another hugely important aspect of the budget be the move towards integrate settlement for mayoral combine authority that will truly move decision make away from the centre end the command and control mindset and put power in the hand of local leader and community who know our area so much well than official in whitehall that approach have the potential to bring transformational change to our region and deliver both great value for money and well outcome for our resident while lancashire be not currently in position to receive that sort of settlement the budget should be signal to council leader and other key stakeholder in the county of the huge opportunity for lancashire if we can all work together to get devolution structure in place look forward to continue to work with the government and local leader to grasp that opportunity and put lancashire back in the fast lane finally with the average income in rossendale and darwen much low than the standard throughout the uk and even in the rest of the north west wholeheartedly welcome the rise in the national living wage that the chancellor introduce it will mean pay rise for many of my constituent rise that can make truly significant difference to people day to day life take together be delighted to see how the measure in the budget start the process of real and sustained change for the north west but be very much aware that it be simply the start of the process look forward to future budgets it be halloween this evening so think that would come as the scary thing that

hard in government my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale rightly highlight the pandemic and the war in ukraine which have undoubtedly have massive impact on our economy but we be show the sign of recovery as he point out my hon friend the member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies rightly focus on the new tax on education and especially the impact on displace child which appreciate my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin give great speech first highlight the importance of pub and the hospitality industry but then the

the devastating impact of the budget on family farm my hon friend the member for romford andrew rosindell make excellent remark not least about margaret thatcher and in particular the importance of private sector investment to our economy those speech be part of debate that have include some excellent maiden speech the hon member for worcester tom collins will as an engineer bring great talent

in champion that sector as well as his constituent the hon member for ribble valley maya ellis paint wonderful picture of her constituency her dad clearly make good decision in raise his family there and if may say so he would be extremely proud of what she have achieve but feel that she be only get start let turn to today subject the government be call it fix the foundation but frankly think the obr would call it break the foundation because in just one hour labour break our economic fundamental labour have break trust with the british people and the spirit of aspiration and opportunity which it will never understand or accept be the true foundation of growth in our economy our country wake up this morning to new but darker dawn with fear and feeling of betrayal people wake up to number of headline that be not sure the chancellor be expect or hop for include halloween horror show tax bombshell for britain striver thing can only debt particularly like and even the guardian lament the return of tax and spend under labour it be indeed budget that have break our economic fundamental labour have perform its big turn yet and reverse our economic recovery let we never forget that the labour government inherit the fast growth in the inflation at target and deficit that be half what we inherit from labour their first act be to spook consumer and business confidence which fall more sharply than at any time since the pandemic now we see those bad fear be realise across almost every conceivable metric the late figure on our economy make for grim reading even for halloween the high tax burden in history debt up and rise as share of gdp in every year of the forecast and debt interest payment above billion in every year of the forecast the first time ever that that have happen the obr say that inflation will be high interest rate will be high for long mortgage rate will be revise up gilt rate be today soar real household income be decline and employment will undoubtedly be down as anybody who have run business would tell we and for what unbelievably and perhaps most humiliatingly growth the no pledge and priority for this chancellor have be downgrade by the obr as result of the budget the government use to talk about pull the growth lever but they have go and pull we into reverse it be unbelievable the labour government have also break trust with the british people they promise that they would not raise national insurance but the budget increase it by billion they promise that their plan be fully fund but the obr call the budget the large increase in borrowing as result of policy in nearly three decade they promise that they would not fiddle the fiscal rule but they have do just that to fund their borrowing spree they promise that they would crowd in private sector investment the obr now say that it be be crowd out by this budget they promise to boost business investment the obr say that it will now fall they promise to cut energy bill by we question they countless time on that and the obr now say that we will experience high gas and electricity price to justify all of this the government concoct fictitious black hole which the obr yesterday refuse to endorse let quote this to labour members because it be important that we clear this up once and for all richard hughes of the obr be directly ask this question live on television he say nothing in our review be legitimisation of that billion nobody believe it nobody be back it up finally labour have break the spirit of aspiration that as say be the true foundation of growth we on the conservative benches recognise that it be the british people and british business who drive growth and prosperity in our country not the government and certainly not this labour government this budget say to britain if you want to invest to expand to take risk to innovate and to build well life for yourself and your child labour will not back you it will tax you far from fix the foundation this be budget of broken promise budget of betrayal and budget that will set we back push we down and kill aspiration it be budget that the public will never forget and will never forgive thank my right hon friend the member for wolverhampton south east pat mcfadden for open today debate and for so clearly remind we of the state in which the conservatives leave our country as many member have rightly make clear today yesterday budget make choice about the future of our country they be not just choice to get through the next few month until the next fiscal event as we get use to under the last government but choice sometimes difficult one about the long term future of the uk economy and the public finance the chancellor budget honour our manifesto commitment by restore economic stability fix the public finance and boost long term sustainable investment in our country the first budget of this new government turn the page on the last year of chaos and decline this budget be generational event to fix the foundation so that we can deliver the change that the people of this country vote for it begin to address the urgent pressure that our nhs our school our police and our border be under however this budget be not just about the come year nor even the whole of this parliament it be about make the right long term decision to create opportunity for people throughout the country put more money in people pocket and begin decade of national renewal thank the minister for give way he be very generous he have mention choice could he comment on the fact that the cost of borrowing be soar after this tax raise labour budget of broken promise labour members have talk about crashed economy but now the government be preside over their own low growth slow growth car crash and they be live in denial themselves although we will not comment on market movement the chancellor outline yesterday two new robust fiscal rule which be the bedrock of stability on which this budget be build those rule will put the public finance on sustainable path and prioritise investment to support long term growth the current budget be in surplus by billion in with net financial debt fall in and with headroom of billion when we go into the election in july the first step that we promise to the british people open with these three word deliver economic stability as the chancellor confirm yesterday our first fiscal rule be the stability rule that mean we will bring the current budget into balance so that day to day spending be meet with tax receipt no more borrowing for day to day spending no more live beyond our mean and no more papering over the crack our tough new stability rule mean that the british people business and the market can all see the fiscal responsibility that will underpin every decision we take in government the chancellor be clear that take the tough decision need to deliver stability be not always easy the previous government duck the difficult decision they make promise after promise to the british people that they know they could never afford our stability rule offer different approach meeting it mean we need to raise taxis but we have be clear that we will protect work people that be why the budget do not increase income tax or national insurance contribution that work people see on their payslip instead we be balance the book in fair way that do not always mean decision be easy far from it but it be also right that before consider any change to taxis we make sure everyone pay the tax they owe by close the tax gap that be why as the chancellor set out yesterday we will deliver the most ambitious package to close the tax gap that this country have ever see alongside series of policy change set out in the budget document by hmrc will have recruit additional compliance officer and fund additional debt management staff together that will mean billion in additional tax revenue to pay for the country priority before we make single change to tax rate or threshold beyond the crucial work to close the tax gap the budget confirm that we will implement our manifesto promise include to abolish the non dom tax loophole which the obr say will raise billion over the forecast period we will end the vat exemption and business rate relief for private school which the obr confirm will raise billion year by as of today we have increase the stamp duty land tax surcharge on second home to help more than people to buy their first home or move home over the next five year while raise million year by to support public service know hon member have raise question about some of the other tax change announce in the budget and be glad to have the opportunity to respond in particular would like to address the change we have make to inheritance tax specifically the reform to agricultural property relief realise that people may be concern about the impact on family farm so would like to make clear some of the fact about how the reform to this relief will work the main rate of agricultural property relief on all asset be set at until at which point it be raise to just before the election that year let be clear these reform still provide very significant level of relief to protect family farm the chancellor confirm yesterday that the first million of combined business and agricultural asset will continue to receive relief in most circumstance asset above million will attract relief equal to the rate which mean that inheritance tax will be pay at rate of instead of our reform in tough fiscal context still leave the relief as be far more generous than it have be in the past it be important to note that agricultural and business property relief be in addition to the nil rate band and other exemption such as the transfer between spouse and civil partner and the rule on gift indeed the national farmers union director of strategy have highlight that these other feature of the tax system be important he say just today that apr be not the be all and end all for pass on farm on death indeed these exemption mean that if someone have no other asset and be pass it on to direct descendant farm or farming business worth up to million can be pass on without pay any inheritance tax at all furthermore those liable for charge can in most circumstance pay any liability over annual instalment let also be clear about the datum on agricultural property relief the total value of farm should not be confuse with the value be pass on at death multiple family member can own part of farm for example if an individual jointly own farm worth million with their partner only million be in their estate at death in the most recent year for which data be available the median value of asset qualify for apr be three quarter of estate claim for asset below million and such estate will continue to pay no inheritance tax at all just claim be for agricultural asset of over million or of all claim the large asset those worth over million relate to just of claim for apr that datum be publish openly on for everyone to see and encourage people to investigate it it do seem rather odd to introduce new tax and then to defend it on the basis that very few people will pay it why be the minister so confident that it will yield anything recognisable in term of contribution to the public finance the few landowner who will be catch by this measure will be make other arrangement to ensure that they avoid it particularly the very large landowner thank the hon gentleman for acknowledge that the impact of these change be limited and target that be an important point he lead on to my concluding point which be to point out that the decision we have take to retain apr but to limit its generosity for the top quarter or so of asset be the right approach to fix the public finance while also protect family farm have set out some of the detail of how we be restore stability and responsibility to the public finance and meet

of countless veteran for the well thank he at this time of year we come together to honour the profound sacrifice make in time of conflict and to remember those who give their life so we could live our in peace it be right to have this debate about those veteran that government have let down in the past not because as some would assert talk about diversity inclusivity and live experience make our armed force weak but because it make they strong the gay ban which be active from to be an abhorrent period of our history for over three decade discriminatory practice and policy exclude lgbt individual those policy create culture of fear and discrimination in which people be compel to hide and deny who they be or risk lose everything the treatment in that way of people who be actively serve our country often put themselves in harm way be shameful chapter in our history it undermine the value that we hold so close of respect honour duty freedom and inclusion especially as gay man to whom this period feel somewhat alien consider the freedom we enjoy today find it sicken to reflect on that legacy we must ensure that it never happen again thank my hon friend for secure the debate as he have rightly mention although the damage of the ban on lgbt personnel serve from to and their abhorrent treatment can not be undo the restorative measure contain in the independent review remain hugely important do he agree that it be incredibly important to ensure justice that step be take to create great awareness of the measure which should be implement forthwith my hon friend the chair of the select committee it be good to see he in his place be completely right about the recommendation make as part of the review will come on to that point shortly pay tribute to fight with pride an lgbt veteran charity for the amazing work they do in advocate and support the health and wellbeing of lgbt veteran service personnel and their family have meet craig jones and carl austin behan whose strength and work in this area have be invaluable to many they make the important point more eloquently than that this be about security it be about the historic injustice of life ruin by prison sentence criminal record and be label as sex offender and the shame that bring indeed craig highlight two particular case to the first be of steven man imprison for his sexuality during the while serve in germany the second be david gulf war veteran imprison and register as sex offender in the mid just month before be bear this stuff be not ancient history lord etherton review make stark the terrible experience that so many lgbtq veteran have to endure his report bear out the painful reality of be forcibly remove from the armed force the harassment these people face and the acute loss that such discrimination lead to as one veteran say particularly poignantly my ejection from the army make homeless my mother disown for bring shame to the family and end up live in car with an unhealthy relationship with alcohol until get myself back together it take year that summarise the deep emotional scar that have be leave by system that fail in its duty to protect those who serve my own constituent would not be raise this issue without his lobbying throughout the campaign and since become an mp be not gay man but be dismiss base on suspicion about his sexuality he be leave with life in tatter live in shame and anguish for year and his relationship with his family be break because of the decision that be take about he the review finding be both alarming and revealing highlight that even after the repeal of the ban lgbt veteran continue to face both discrimination and stigma and many still face significant barrier in access the full range of benefit and service they deserve underscore how unwelcoming the culture can be for lgbt service member it be unacceptable it be not what we want for britain and it can not be what the armed force be about know that the minister agree it be year since begin to get involve in campaign on lgbt issue so this be not as ancient history for as it be for my hon friend as he be young than get that in before he do be speak to veteran last night my hon friend have mention how this be still affect people and the world have change significantly from when start campaign when people be still be criminalise and convict but this be still live issue for many people and there be concern among campaigner that many veteran be now get old and time be run out for they to be able to resolve this thank my hon friend for that intervention and be grateful for his experience it come as bit of reality check that especially as gay man we stand on the shoulder of giant in this space the people who have come before we have live much more difficult life and face much more discrimination than we do so the duty be on we to raise these point the report point out several aspect of the situation point out in particular the mental health difficulty face by lgbt veteran against the special nature of the experience and trauma they be expose to they report high rate of suicide homelessness and mental health issue that include but be not limit to symptom of post traumatic stress disorder and depression that be why focus on target service be important to adjust to their need access to healthcare and support service be an additional concern raise by the review many lgbt veteran report difficulty in navigate the support system and too often feel that their identity and experience be not understand or respect even in the present day for these veteran the lack of sensitivity and awareness in the system be significant obstacle to receive the care and support they deserve it be essential that our system cultivate an environment of understanding and respect go forward one that acknowledge the distinct experience of lgbt veteran within the wide veteran support network the creation of dedicated support scheme tailor to the need of lgbt veteran be another critical recommendation these programme should include peer to peer support mental health resource and other service that acknowledge and validate the unique experience of lgbt veteran peer support in particular can be an invaluable resource offer veteran safe space to share their experience build connection and receive encouragement from other who understand their journey increase outreach effort be also essential to ensure that lgbt veteran be aware of the service available to they for too long many of those veteran have feel marginalise and disconnect from the resource intend to support they we have to link those people up targeted communication strategy be need to engage this community effectively ensure that they know their right and the resource at their disposal by proactively reach out to lgbt veteran we can foster sense of belong to ensure that they receive the support that they need financial redress stand out as key recommendation in lord etherton review underscore the need to compensate those affect by these historic wrong although the previous government offer formal apology and take meaningful step to implement many of the review recommendation the allocate million compensation scheme fund fall short inadequately compensate the estimate lgbt veteran and those affect by discriminatory practice this amount be insufficient to address the depth of the harm inflict or the number of people whose life have be trash in many case we must advocate for more substantial commitment to financial redress one that reflect the true scale of injustice endure by these individual and that seek to make amend in meaningful way know the minister be genuinely alive to this he be listen and he and the defence secretary understand the plight of this community thank he for his continue work in this area to support our veteran especially as man of service himself the independent lgbt veteran review provide comprehensive road map to address the inequality face by lgbt veteran by recognise the ongoing challenge we can take decisive step to implement the report recommendation we can work towards create military and veteran support system that truly honour the service of all individual regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity this commitment to inclusivity and justice be not only moral imperative but testament to the value we strive to uphold as nation value that know the minister and the government agree with let we take this opportunity to ensure that the sacrifice of all our veteran be acknowledge and respect let we all work together to build future in which every service member be afford the dignity and support they deserve free from the shadow of discrimination this be our chance to demonstrate our commitment to justice to extend hand to those we have wrong include the review of financial redress and to create legacy of equality and respect within our armed force today and for the future congratulate the hon member for burnley oliver ryan on secure this debate an excellent move also thank the minister and you madam deputy speaker for allow to speak follow somewhat short notice request be confident that the house will come together today to recognise the service of many of our armed force who be shockingly discriminate against and dismiss for nothing more than be who they be the liberal democrat party constitution include the belief that everyone should be free from poverty ignorance and conformity it be in that spirit that we on the liberal democrat benches add our support to the recommendation of the etherton review also add our support and thank to the work of the organisation already list that campaign for the right of these people five minute from my house be the raf cadet base which see on the way to the army cadet force where be an adult instructor confess that in come into the chamber and thank the minister be not sure whether should be salute or bow be only sergeant what want to say be that my constituent mark shepherd use to be member of the raf cadet in taunton in my constituency and later go on to pursue the career he want as technician mark go on to see active service on the frontline with tornados in the second kuwait war and in kosovo but he be then question about his sexuality and present with the option of either leave immediately immediate dismissal from which he would have lose considerable sum of money for young man at that stage in life or the premature retirement route which he have to take that mean he have to stay in the service much long in very difficult circumstance with cloud hang over he when really all that should have hang over he be our nation gratitude for serve our country on the frontline and put his life on the line be delighted that this issue have come to the fore genuinely congratulate the hon member for burnley on bring it forward be absolutely delighted that in few week in taunton will be present mark with his raf certificate to recognise the injustice that be do to he it be my absolute privilege to have the opportunity to do that and to explain and pay tribute to his service in this debate thank my hon friend the member for burnley oliver ryan for secure this very welcome debate and the minister for veterans and people my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak al carns for the collegiate and sympathetic way he have engage with and other colleague across the house over recent week represent constituency with significant number of lgbt veteran some of whom have have the huge honour of meeting in recent week have also be fortunate enough to work with fight with pride the same organisation my hon friend the member for burnley refer to early and be pleased to say that they join we in the public gallery today let be clear about the injustice that have be suffer here as the etherton review set out for over four decade considerable time resource and effort be put into hunt down people who be suspect of be gay in the armed force that lead among other thing to arrest interrogation demean physical inspection and medical treatment court martial imprisonment and be dismiss in disgrace as we have hear this leave many lgbt veteran often at young age with criminal record and no job income or family support in the short time have just want to highlight one case constituent of mine who meet last week steve join the raf in at the age of he work on vulcan bombers at raf waddington serve three tour of the falklands and be station in west germany he have an impeccable service record in he be investigate by the raf over relationship with male officer he make the fatal mistake of tell the truth and be sentence to six month in jail he lose his rank all his financial benefit his family and the career he love when he be release he be year old homeless and have nowhere to turn as say meet steve he be man of huge honour and courage but these be the word he say to feel wash in shame my career be shatter have criminal record have no pension and have to live hand to mouth for the rest of life survive on benefit raise steve case not because it be unique in fact as we have hear today it be not even an outlier it be sadly typical of the story of too many lgbt veteran loss of earning loss of dignity and loss of purpose not over the short term but over lifetime that be why gently ask the minister who have be incredibly sympathetic and while recognise the financial situation under which the government operate whether cap payment at an average of around per person can really be appropriate for the level of injustice suffer by steve and so many other lgbt veteran finally the defence secretary for whom have enormous respect say when the etherton report be publish this be unfinished business for labour official report december vol agree and know that the veterans minister will want to complete that work and finally deliver the justice for which lgbt veteran have be wait far too long thank my hon friend the member for burnley oliver ryan for secure this debate he be prove himself to be powerful advocate for his constituency may also welcome my hon and gallant friend the minister to his place and thank he for all the work he do he be credit to the government finally thank you madam deputy speaker for your indulgence in allow to speak this afternoon the very fact that we have to hold this debate be reminder that there be once time when person ability to serve be question because of the person they love discrimination against any lgbt person be of course appalling but it take special kind of cynicism and bigotry to punish denigrate and demean volunteer servicemen and woman soldier who serve willingly fight beside their peer willingly and in some case die or be injure in the line of duty because of their sexuality there be never any excuse for the law be what they be there be no justification on account of ability in combat no rationale base on individual discipline and no standard that those serviceman and woman could not and do not reach the law exist simply because of fear of difference and an intolerance of lgbt people it be inexcusable it be worth reflect on the sad truth that there use to be consensus about those law shamefully in quite recently cross party select committee reject call for the removal of the ban but it be important to note that year on there be new consensus before brave individual such as naval officer duncan lustig prean raf sergeant graeme grady raf nurse jeanette smith and navy weapon engineer john beckett have to stand alone but now this place be unite in condemnation of that policy and alongside the phenomenal charity that have be reference such as fight with pride support the thousand of lgbt soldier sailor and airmen in our armed force be pleased to say that member of my new team here in parliament be an army reservist and have see in his own military career an improvement in attitude towards himself and other colleague it be journey but it be worth acknowledge that thing be improve instead of be see as threat and source of disruption difference be see as an advantage celebrate difference and diversity of thought avoid group think and foster think soldier environment be part of wide conceptual component that give our military an edge it be not enough simply to say that we tolerate lgbt people in our military or our society we value their unique contribution to our force however even though we be far beyond the ban of the we need to support those whom we let down be worried as other hon member be that cap be place on the compensation scheme for the veteran that lose their career because of institutional bigotry by the british state agree with my hon friend how can be deem sufficient compensation for someone own chaplain initiate an investigation and subsequent interrogation of they by the special investigation branch the british state treat many thousand of people with contempt in exchange for their willingness to serve it expose they to state sanction institutionalised homophobia and to discharge leave they isolated from their friend and family be glad that we be build new consensus but let we go step far and make sure that those brave selfless servicemen and woman get the compensation and redress that they deserve and they be only the one we know about how many more manage by hide their true self how many more deny their true self to themselves we must do right by these people finally as we approach remembrance day hope that we can all add to our reflection moment for lgbt veteran specifically will be think of edward brittain edward be bear in macclesfield my constituency at as temporary lieutenant in the sherwood foresters edward fight in the battle of the somme he be injure twice shoot in the arm and then in the right thigh on june his gallantry win he the military cross just as the minister do edward citation be precise and understate for conspicuous gallantry and leadership during an attack he be severely wound but continue to lead his man with great bravery and coolness until second wound disable he on return to the front he be tip off by his command officer that he would face court martial when he come out of the line as army censor have read in his personal correspondence that he have have an intimate relationship with man in his company on june as edward lead his company on counter attack on the asagio plateau to recapture trench and stop an enemy advance he be shoot and kill by an enemy sniper he be year old whether he deliberately put himself in position to be kill as his sister and his co believe be unknowable but what be knowable be that have edward come out of the line alive between june and january he would have be court martialle and sham by the country he have shed blood for edward have military cross he be shoot twice at the battle of the somme but return to the front and lead his man with bravery however none of that matter he would have be consider disruption to the unit let be the first person in this place to thank captain edward brittain mc for his service he deserve well from his country be grateful to my hon friend the member for burnley oliver ryan for initiate this debate thank the hon member for taunton and wellington mr amos for lend his support and for his fantastic support for cadet which be absolutely super thank my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven chris ward for share harrowing story that be all too familiar across the system thank my hon friend the member for macclesfield tim roca for his moving story which really resonate give what we be discuss today early this month have the privilege of speak at the defence award where thank former and serve personnel for their tenacity and courage mention that anyone can dodge bullet bomb or artillery fire but to fight against the tide when everything be bear down on you and to continue the struggle and fight for justice be commendable wise man once say to that courage be decision not reaction those fight for pride and other who have champion this cause for so long be truly courageous indeed they be the brave of the brave the abhorrent way in which lgbt service personnel be treat between and by the ministry of defence be completely unacceptable the ministry be on the wrong side of history its historical policy of prohibit homosexuality in the armed force be simply wrong which be why the lgbt veteran independent review conduct by lord etherton have unite this chamber since its report come out in july last year this government support the review in opposition and we be now support its delivery trust that colleague appreciate the importance of this remain cross party issue as we address the remain recommendation want to personally thank lord etherton for all the thoughtful work he have do to address the burning injustice and be pleased that of his recommendation have be implement can confirm that we have already receive application for non financial restorative measure through the website in practice this mean that the chief of the army the royal navy and the royal air force have send apology letter directly to the individual affect by these issue medal and beret that should never have be take away have be reissue and each of the service have host several presentation ceremony to welcome lgbt veteran back into the service family where they have always belong rightly our focus be now on fully address the outstanding recommendation include the two that relate to financial redress for those dismiss and discharge as result of the ban so very much welcome this opportunity to hear the view of hon member it will help inform the government work to design an appropriate financial redress scheme that enable application to be consider on case by case basis and timely payment to be make can reassure veteran and the whole lgbt community that the need of potential claimant be be carefully consider at each stage include the need for fast lane for applicant in certain circumstance especially those with terminal illness be of course aware of speculation and have hear some figure in relation to the fund trust colleague will understand that we continue to finalise its modality and it be too soon for to comment on exact figure however the government be fully commit to meet our inherit target of open the application window by the end of and it remain open for two year be not sure whether it be common procedure for someone intervene in their own debate but appreciate the minister time and thank he for his comment about the compensation scheme know that he be do the work and that he sincerely understand the scenario for these people it would be remiss of not to mention that although steven my constituent feel that yesterday budget be great in lot of way particularly the provision around infected blood and the post office scandal he want compensation scheme to deal with this issue in the same way hope that the minister will look at that make sure that we do not wait another year for the next budget to talk about what we can do financially and sustainably and recognise the context that steven reference thank my hon friend for that intervention to link that to what my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven say be aware of recent speculation about the size of any fund and redress payment it be not possible to have certainty about the number of applicant at the moment it be also premature to estimate the size of the payment award but we be work to make sure that the broad number of individual receive
