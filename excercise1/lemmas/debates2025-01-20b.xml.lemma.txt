quarter of billion pound have the potential to stimulate growth and create job across the region yet local delivery of the ambition be slow and stagnant what message would the minister send to spark action from the three conservative snp run administration in the region so that ayrshire can realise its potential as world class business region be sorry to hear that for our part the uk government be work closely with local partner and the scottish government to deliver the ayrshire growth deal which as my hon friend say be worth over quarter of billion pound as part of that we be support programme review so that if any strategic change be need to ensure that the originally envisage benefit be realise they be make on the message that she ask for we need to move at pace exactly as the government have commit to do so that the people of ayrshire get what be promise the village and town of mid norfolk be reel from the cost of live crisis and the government taxis attack on job and small business rather than tax rural area and spend the money in the city may suggest that minister allow rural council to keep the proceed of their growth and incentivise they to support business out in our rural community rather than allow the government to milk rural area to spend the money in city can not accept the hon gentleman characterisation this government decision whether on the support go into rural community and rural policing or the different business rate reduction show that we want to support business in those community to thrive and we will continue to do so thank the minister very much for his answer he be regular visitor to northern ireland and that be because he love northern ireland and want to ensure that we play our part in the economic boost since come into government have he have an opportunity to speak to his northern ireland counterpart to ensure that we can go forward together as we should be grateful to the hon gentleman for his kind point have strong personal enthusiasm for northern ireland its potential be huge speak frequently to ministers in the northern ireland executive and will continue to do so as part of the prime minister and deputy prime minister reset of our relationship with the devolved administration we meet they regularly and plan together so that our investment and their investment get the good value will continue to do that and look forward to work with the hon gentleman as well call the shadow minister we share the government ambition on local growth but companies house be report the high level of business closure in year will the government commit to publish an assessment of the impact that their national insurance rise business rate rise and change to business property relief be have on local growth plan have no doubt that the opposition will have all the information they need to scrutinise the government of the day we always provide that with full transparency what will not accept be that the sand our economy be build on after the past four year under the conservative government of the shadow minister and the shadow secretary of state be somehow this government failure in reality the hon gentleman know exactly as we do that we be fix the mess that they leave of course they will have the chance to oppose we along the way but we will get on with deliver for the british people and they will get on with carping from the sideline know where would rather be social housing providers section if she will take step to support social housing provider to fund house make available under section of the town and country planning act recognise that social housing provider need support to build their capacity and make great contribution to affordable housing supply include via section to assist in that we have propose new five year social housing rent settlement and permit council to keep all their right to buy receipt know that my hon friend be commit to increase the provision of social housing in the past few year most social housing have be provide through section agreement accord to the national housing federation thousand of house around the country be available but can not be purchase under section agreement because register social landlord simply do not have the resource be sure that he be aware of that problem but do he have any plan to deal with it and bring those house which be badly need back into use the government certainly recognise the ongoing challenge pose by the reduce appetite of register provider of social housing to buy affordable home deliver under section agreement as hope my hon friend be aware the homes england section affordable housing clearing service be launch back in december alongside the revise national planning policy framework with the aim of support buyer and seller of section home to find each other more effectively we be call on all developer with uncontracted section affordable home as well as provider and local planning authority to engage proactively with that new service we will consider what further measure may be necessary to address the problem inform by datum from that service private developer in my constituency have obligation to build social home under section and they be ready to do so the difficulty they face be that there be no social landlord available to take those unit when raise this issue with the deputy prime minister in october she say that she be aware of the problem and be work to tackle it will the minister update the house on the progress make be not sure whether the hon gentleman hear my previous answer but have just make it clear that we act on december to establish matching service would advise he to ask the developer whether they have take advantage of that service we want to learn lesson from the datum that come out of it to see whether we need to take further step we think that the matching service will allow registered provider and developer try to offload section unit to come together to see if agreement can be reach local government reorganisation devon what plan her department have for local government reorganisation in devon on december write to all council in two tier area and neighbour small unitarie include in devon to set out plan for joint programme of devolution and local government reorganisation later this month intend to formally write out to those council on the shortlist to ask for interim proposal by march and full proposal later in the year we will confirm that as soon as possible because we know it be important to have clarity obviously any reorganisation will impact council finance my constituency of north devon have coastal town with real pocket of remote deprivation isolation and poverty now that the minister department have cut the rural service delivery grant what methodology will be use to ensure that local government funding do not overlook those area with respect the hon gentleman be conflate two entirely separate issue one be reorganisation which will take money away from the back office and put it on the frontline where people can see the benefit of that investment but to be absolutely clear on rural service the provisional settlement that be lay out ensure that primarily rural council get an average increase of and no council see net reduction in its income level that be our commitment to rural community and it be firm call the liberal democrat spokesperson refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as serve councillor on bournemouth christchurch and poole council many council have already undergo significant reorganisation from move to share service right the way through to full unitarisation and the cost of that have always be underestimate although transformation lead to low long term revenue cost we know that council everywhere be teeter on the edge so find fund to pay for reorganisation transformation and redundancy will be problematic the mayoral authority add an extra complication so can the minister confirm that funding from central government will be provide to fully cover both devolution and local government reorganisation so that council do not have to factor extra cost into their and budget or risk reduce local service far the government be not require any area to reorganise what we do be write out and invite proposal to be submit and pay tribute to councillor across the country for the leadership they have show in put those proposal forward investment to support lgr or devolution will follow bit later but to be clear this be bottom up reorganisation be request by local council and they have our full support in that process homelessness what step her department be take to work with the devolved administration to support people sleep rough in winter fund for homelessness service in england be increase next year by million take the total to record billion this will help prevent rise in the number of family in temporary accommodation and in rough sleeping today have announce the tripling of emergency winter pressure fund from million to million housing and homelessness be devolved

uk will the minister commit to address their need specifically in the homelessness strategy that be come up my hon friend make really important point about the impact on child and young people it be an absolute scandal that nearly child be in temporary accommodation and we be determined to ensure that the government long term strategy address the underlie issue affect youth homelessness we be work with mayor council and key stakeholder include in the charitable sector to get we back on track to end homelessness call the shadow minister st mungo have report rise in rough sleeping in london under this government compare with the same period under the last government will this government commit to remove the ringfence that they have introduce around the homelessness prevention grant heed council call to give they back the flexibility they need to get rough sleeper and homeless household into accommodation and avoid the cost shunt they impose on council tax payer thank the shadow minister for his question the fact be that this government be invest record amount of funding to tackle the root cause that require action on prevention and we be work with council to ensure that we address those underlying cause we have inherit mess record level of homelessness and rough sleeping and we be determined to get grip on it that mean action on prevention as well as address the impact of homelessness and rough sleeping and that be what we be determined to do one strategy that council use to address homelessness be to move homeless household elsewhere in the country that can be an appropriate response but it need to be do in consultation with the receiving authority do the minister share my concern that labour lead rushmoor council be use the standard procedure to attack its own member for bring this legitimate matter of concern to public attention the shadow minister will be aware that the shortage of housing be drive out of area placement be very happy to come back to he on his specific example but the deputy prime minister have write to council set out their responsibility and that out of area placement should be last resort we will continue to work with council to support they as they deal with the challenge of the underlie problem which be the housing shortage and the crisis that have be leave behind we be determined to ensure that we get grip by provide the support they need with funding as well as the million home that this government be determined to build english devolution bill local public services if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of the english devolution bill on local public service if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of the english devolution bill on local public service the english devolution bill will strengthen public service by deliver local government reorganisation and establish more directly elect mayor who will have the new power to convene public service the bill will also deliver new health improvement duty for strategic authority and enable more mayor to take on responsibility for police and crime commissioner function and health function as well to co ordinate well on local public service beyond mayor the white paper reassert the role of local authority as leader of place and the delivery arm for the government mission the catastrophic impact of the level of debt leave behind by the previous conservative council be be feel all over thurrock our service have be cut to the absolute quick and delivery for resident be at an all time low although welcome the impact that devolution will have on growth and value for money what reassurance can the minister offer that devolution will finally give we the chance to turn the page and deliver where it matter for my constituent that be shared ambition the government be determined to take power away from westminster and put it into the hand of local community we know that drive well outcome and well public service rest on fair funding and for too long council have be impoverished while more expectation have be place on they the funding reform we be consult on will be part of rebuild the foundation but this be very significant project to get power away from this place to local community english devolution provide generational opportunity to unlock the potential of town such as nuneaton thank the minister for his time and support in ensure we get these option right will he continue to meet and council representative to discuss the good option for unlock growth and opportunity in nuneaton thank my hon friend and the many other mp with whom have have meeting to talk about devolution at the last tally about one to one meeting with mp have take place such be the interest be show in devolution for the right reason be more than happy to continue those conversation and to welcome the local leadership be show draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests several mid leicestershire village such as glenfield birstall and braunstone town be extremely anxious at the prospect of be force into large city unitary as result of the english devolution bill will the minister agree to meet to discuss this matter and will he give my constituent the assurance that they will not be force into city unitary against their wish it be important to say that any request for local government reorganisation be propose to government by the local area it be for the government to provide the process by which those application be hear over at least the last four year local authority election have be postpone countless time to allow reorganisation to take place to be clear there be bottom up approach for both the postponement of election and the boundary that be draw for the unitarie our job be to ensure that the process support that approach want to ask about the interaction between the planning reform and devolution which be two huge bit of legislation in tunbridge wells we have local plan but we have be ask when we do our new local plan to have increase in house except we will not have new local plan because tunbridge wells borough council will cease to exist it will become part of the west kent unitary authority how will these two huge reform interact and what will it mean for housing number in tunbridge wells in sense council be only an organisation at point in time but there will always be local authority responsible for the area we want to ensure that the authority be strategic but also take that wide view reorganisation be of course part of that but importantly strategic authority can also take wide responsibility for align public service reform with local growth the hon gentleman talk about housing number and we can sometimes miss how important that be housing target be one thing but we must not forget that for every one of those number there be people and family who currently do not have safe and affordable place to live this agenda be about tackle exactly that planning reform what recent progress she have make on planning reform in december we publish revise national planning policy framework follow extensive consultation we be also make progress on develop our planning and infrastructure bill which will be introduce in the come month constituent of mine be endeavour to prevent her neighbour from build an extension that would affect the right of access set out in her restrictive covenant she be initially quote to to take the neighbour to court such cost make civil law inaccessible to ordinary people will the minister consider look at way that restrictive covenant can be bring into the planning process as material consideration be sorry to learn of the experience of my hon friend constituent legal restriction on property be not usually treat as material planning consideration the planning process only address whether the development be acceptable in plan term material consideration must relate to planning purpose such as the character or use of the land if my hon friend wish to write to with further detail on this will endeavour to explore it far in gosport we be face massive increase in our housing number and planner be put in application to build across the very last green space in the strategic gap between gosport and fareham which already have air quality issue and overstretch local infrastructure we do have an abundance of disuse military site however so what priority be the minister give to encourage development on brownfield site rather than eat up the last remain green field in area such as gosport which be already overdeveloped the government have brownfield first approach to development we strengthen that approach in the recently revise national planning policy framework we also publish last year brownfield passport work paper to explore further way in which we might prioritise and accelerate the release of brownfield land on plan make we be ask local authority to take sequential approach brownfield first densify those brownfield site if possible and work cross boundary where possible and only then explore grey belt release and greenfield release in extremis we be in conversation with departments across the board about how we can well optimise the use of public sector land across all departments topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility no one in britain today should face the cold and indignity of have to sleep in doorway so the minister for homelessness and democracy my hon friend the member for bethnal green and stepney rushanara ali have today announce the tripling of the rough sleeping winter pressure fund this will ensure that as many people as possible have access to safe roof over their

this for far too long and must act now to make these building safe agree that remediation have be too slow this government be laser focused on speed up the remediation of dangerous building and encourage the scottish government for which this be devolved matter to increase their effort as we be to up the pace of remediation in scotland call the shadow secretary of state do the secretary of state agree that everyone should be treat equally and be see to be treat equally before the law include plan law do not know where the shadow secretary of state be go with this but yes think people should be treat equally great why then be it that the secretary of state the foreign secretary the home secretary and the prime minister have all intervene in the planning application for the chinese super embassy override the wish and concern of local resident the local planning authority the metropolitan police the security service and most likely the incoming us president these be live issue but the security of our country and nation always come foremost and that be always what this government think of first constituent of mine in high green be tell that social housing repair project for their home would take week the project have now be ongoing for week with contractor leave the work in disgraceful condition welcome the government boost to the building of more social housing and the

but home be war zone particularly in the east and they can not do so they therefore have child in school here and have build life here it would reassure they to know that they be safe and secure in the united kingdom for not just the future but the immediate future and will be able to be here for as long as it take none of we know when the war will complete but across our constituency we all recognise community that continue to be here come out of other conflict be think of kosovan community for example which exist right across the country can think of significant community in south london in particular many ukrainians want to return and we should make it possible for they to do so but in some area there will have to be lot of de mining let we face it in order for they to go back to their home let we see where we get to at the end of the conflict thank the foreign secretary for the statement exeter large and vibrant ukrainian heritage community will welcome this further strengthening of our cultural security and economic tie go back to sanction will he confirm that the uk will continue to keep up the pace and pressure of sanction on russia and indeed strengthen they where necessary to close the loophole in full partnership with our ally have be very proud of the work have lead on sanction since come to office it be now the strong sanction package against russia anywhere in the world with more to come welcome the government effort on the year partnership president zelensky have make great stride in crack down on corruption in his country but he have long way to go he have probably get rid of most of the low hang fruit what extra effort will the uk government make in assist the ukrainian government to crack down on corruption which will aid its ability to get nato membership also push the foreign secretary on whether he have further view on how maritime support can work in conjunction with the montreux convention the right hon gentleman will be pleased to know that the minister for europe my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty meet official from ukraine on the issue of anti corruption just few week ago this be an issue have speak about directly with president zelensky in the past and it be an issue that the us traditionally have take big interest in be first in ukraine look at those issue in opposition at that stage the uk be fund lot of work with non governmental organisation that work must continue to break the corruption lot of it legacy frankly of the soviet union thank the foreign secretary for his statement we have already see the extensive role of the russian shadow fleet in the black sea and across the world most recently in the baltics what further action can the uk government take to tackle the role of the russian black sea fleet in the conflict one of the issue be how third country some of they significant country be still facilitate the russian shadow fleet because of the illicit oil that find its way into various economy those be conversation that we and our european partner continue to take forward if we be serious about tackle putin aggression we have to be serious about the revenue that finance it this morning be strike to hear the foreign secretary describe donald trump as man of incredible grace generosity very funny very friendly very warm and say that most of the world be glad he be back in power yet as trump re enter the white house there be significant concern about whether support for ukraine from the us so far ukraine big backer will continue with trump boasting that he will stop the war in ukraine in day and with his choice for us secretary of state say on wednesday that ukraine will have to make concession to russia do the foreign secretary think that ukraine be as happy as he be to see trump back in power encourage the hon gentleman to actually read the word of president zelensky who say that he welcome donald trump and his approach of peace through strength encourage he to take all opportunity he get over the come year to meet donald trump and make up his own mind welcome the announcement of the new grain verification scheme which will help track steal grain from occupy ukrainian territory do my right hon friend agree that this be an important uk contribution give ukraine role as major agricultural producer which give it critical position in global food security my hon friend be exactly right people forget that before this war ukraine be effectively the breadbasket of europe this be an issue that speak about with ms mccain of the world food programme it be hugely important that those grain supply be able to leave the country it be hugely important that they be not sabotage that be one of the reason why the pillar on the black sea be important there must be the mean for the grain supply to leave ukraine the work continue join other in very much welcome this declaration of solidarity between london and kyiv on the future of ukraine but there be something surreal in these exchange everything be about to change very dramatically we all know that this be kind of pre position statement in advance of mr trump assume the presidency what assessment have the government make the foreign secretary have give we no idea of this at all of what president trump be likely to do and of how they will respond how ready be they to ensure that we do not falter and that we step up our support for ukraine along with our european ally or will president trump call all the shot say to the hon gentleman in whose question be seriousness about the cost of war and what it take to negotiate that when meet donald trump my sense be that he do understand acutely the importance of this war and he strike as man who be not prepared to be loser it be become clear and clear that putin show no sign whatsoever of want to negotiate and we must therefore continue to support ukraine as strongly as we can the hon gentleman will also have pick up read about it in the paper that there be sense previously of rush towards negotiation that have move over time somewhat and that must be right as new administration pick up the file and fully grip this understanding of course that we all want peace warmly welcome this bold new partnership think it be source of pride for everyone in the house that we have more than ukrainians live among we as our friend and neighbour will the foreign secretary offer tribute to the ukrainian community in welwyn garden city who have set up thriving saturday school that have the pleasure of visit just before christmas encourage he to look favourably on their ask for we to fast track ukrainian as gcse and level language because many young people would love to study it but do not currently have the opportunity to do so my hon friend will be pleased to know that the partnership between school under pillar be fundamental it be what give we the bedrock on which to build both the english language capability in ukraine and hope the ukrainian language capability in this country it be to be hop that as have be say president trump can indeed bring significant additional pressure to bear on the dictator putin to end this horrific war will the foreign secretary give additional reassurance to the british people that although we have invest billion and billion of pound in support ukraine we be commit to recover it from the frozen asset of the russian state in due course know that the hon gentleman understand history he will know that after the second world war we be in quite lot of debt to the united states as result of lend lease which it take we many year to pay off today no trading relationship of our be big than that with the united states it total over billion with trillion invest in each other economy and million british people work in us company and million americans work in british company this partnership set up something similar for the next year it be the result of war but it have bring our two nation together he be absolutely right to centre on how we can well use those russian asset that be matter of close discussion across the european family welcome the government commitment to year of friendship with the people of ukraine in pillar which talk about economy and trade there be commitment to broaden mutual market access and raise awareness and utilisation of the uk ukraine free trade agreement how long will it take for that work come into effect and for both country to benefit from it be so glad that my hon friend have draw attention to pillar that allow to remind the house that the prime minister announce million for new economic recovery programme which will create opportunity for uk company by support key growth sector in ukraine that be the bedrock of an enhance trade and investment opportunity and eventually trading relationship when ukraine get back to the normality that know it be so keen to achieve very much welcome the foreign secretary statement as he will know in order to have an endure peace there will need to be credible deterrence for ukraine we have already see the development of deterrence in eastern nation such as estonia latvia and lithuania through the enhance forward presence be the foreign secretary thinking of open up discussion about how we could do that in ukraine in the future establish an enhance forward presence to underpin its security be very grateful to the right hon member for raise this issue ukraine rightful place be in nato ally agree at the july summit in washington that that be the rightful place of ukraine over time however he be right that guarantee will be necessary it be matter of intense discussion we have be the european country that have lead on our military support for ukraine so he be absolutely right that we would expect to play role in that when the day come work with other ally as president zelensky have say the us would have to play role in that too thank the secretary of state and the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty for their leadership on sanction we know that putin shadow fleet be still major source of financing for the war and that cut it off be vital to bring he to the negotiating table and crucially prevent he from rearm later on how do the secretary of state plan to persuade ally and counterpart include some of our own british overseas territory to clamp down on sanction evasion and expand the capture of the shadow fleet to the full extent of that fleet be so grateful to my hon friend for the work he do on these issue prior to come to parliament and for the work that he continue to do he will be pleased that this be subject we have raise particularly with the overseas territory it be also something have raise with both the indians and the turks where we have see some go behind the rule that we have make in order to inadvertently benefit russia the score of ukrainians live in my constituency will be very happy to hear today statement because they be fearful about their future due to the length of time that the war have go on just hope that the foreign secretary stand by these promise more so than the secretary of state for northern ireland have do today for the people of northern ireland he have surrender to the eu rather than protect northern ireland business however do the foreign secretary have any concern about the effect that either the resolve of eu country or the attitude of the forthcoming american administration be likely to have in undermine the message of support to the ukrainian people and the message of defiance to putin say to the right hon gentleman that be man of my word and that be not as worried as some be the reason be that while there be this debate which donald trump have continue to push about our commitment to defence spending it be important to say that if we let putin win defence spending across all of our country will rocket during the cold war defence spending rise to about so think all country need to concentrate their mind on stand by ukraine the ukrainian defence and tech sector have prove themselves resilient and innovative under the harsh pressure of war will the foreign secretary say bit more about how under the new year partnership the uk defence and tech sector can support their ukrainian counterpart likewise how can we learn from the innovation of our ukrainian friend and ally the ukrainians recognise our huge strength in high education and as result innovation which my hon friend will that reference in the eventual treaty prior to the war there be immense expertise in tech and it in ukraine the innovation in drone technology be extraordinary and frankly be change the nature of warfare from which we should benefit for all those reason that be an important pillar from which we will gain as much as ukraine will over the come year pillar state throughout the duration of the declaration neither participant will be leave alone in the face of an attack or aggression to what extent do that act as nato article commitment in lieu of ukraine join nato do it like article facilitate direct uk military action in support of ukraine should it be attack again in the future in violation of the un charter be other nato ally also negotiate similar pact and to what extent do they complement this one unusually the hon gentleman be jump ahead of himself somewhat we continue to support ukraine with every military effort that be go on now and in sense that be the reference he be make have indicate an irreversible pathway to nato as we agree back in september this be not article welcome the statement and thank the foreign secretary and his colleague for work on the partnership as he will know the house in its first debate of the year call on the government to investigate how we might seize russian asset notwithstanding his statement about the ongoing conversation and the sensitivity will he update the house on when he will be able to report back to we on that simply say to the hon gentleman that this be the most sensitive of time we all recognise that this be critical year for ukraine and further fund will need to be find be pleased to see that the billion loan through the will eventually be get into ukrainian coffer but there be more to do and the conversation be live at this point in time it have be report indeed it be mention by the shadow minister the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton that putin have deploy north korean troop in ukraine what be the government response to what be now an axis of operation against ukraine this be incredibly dangerous as we see the euro atlantic theatre and the indo pacific theatre coalesce it be important to emphasise that our assessment be that those troop be be use in kursk we see that we recognise it and we will use all mean necessary to deal with that issue with the tool we have as good we can in the come day while the bad of humanity be be demonstrate with russia invasion of ukraine our nation be show the good of humanity in our rich tradition by open our door to those displace by war one of those family be that of my constituent professor ivan waddington who have adopt ukrainian refugee family whom he see as his own he have ask to ask the government whether they be plan to continue with the scheme and will those ukrainians who have assimilate and be make positive contribution to our country have the right to remain in this country when the war end recognise why hon member have raise this issue but that must rightly be determination for the home secretary at the appropriate time however want to strongly indicate our support for those family in this country and our recognition as the war continue and may go on for some time of the huge contribution they continue to make hope that the year partnership that we have sign be an indication of the inextricable link that we think now exist between ukraine and the united kingdom thank the secretary of state for his statement it will give the almost ukrainian family live in my constituency the encouragement they need it be our desire and their desire that the war in ukraine will come to an end shortly for which be know advocate along with many other member do we still intend to send the billion annual military assistance until whether the war be be fight or not what will no less than billion mean and will we be expect to fund the ukraine defence wholly if ally such as the united states of america do not make the same deal our commitment be for that billion for as long as it take it be solemn and important commitment to ukraine and it underline the cross party support in the house and the strength of support among the british people new hospital programme review with permission mr speaker would like to make statement on the new hospital programme of all the damage that the conservative party do during their time in office the break public finance the broken economy the broken nhs perhaps the most egregious be the broken trust between the british people and their government not just through their scandal or by break the rule they impose on the rest of the country but by make promise that they never intend to keep in the conservatives tell the british people that they would build new hospital over the come decade but there be never new scheme and many of they be extension or refurbishment put simply they be not all new some of they be not hospital and there be not of they five year pass start date be delay spade remain out of the ground and it become clear the announcement be work of fiction yet what do the conservative party manifesto at last year general election say on the matter it say we will invest in more and well facility continue to deliver new hospital by they repeat the promise even though the department of health and social care be put contract out to tender for hospital building that run until they repeat that commitment even after the national audit office find that the government will not now deliver new hospital by they repeat it even though the government own infrastructure watchdog deem it to be unachievable no one think that the promise would be meet yet the conservative party make it anyway time and again despite know this when walk into the department of health and social care on july what discover shock the scheme be not just year behind schedule the money provide by the previous government be due to run out in march just week from today on may the then health and social care secretary the right hon member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay stand at this dispatch box and tell the house today announcement confirm more than billion of report may vol the truth be that no funding have be set aside for future year the money simply be not there this be programme build on the shaky foundation of false hope if be shock by what discover patient ought to be furious not just because the promise make to they be never go to be keep but because they can see when they go into hospital how badly the health service need new building the nhs be quite literally crumble lord darzi independent investigation find that the nhs be starve of capital investment by the previous government its outdated estate have hit productivity with service disrupt at hospital every day during have visit hospital where the roof have fall in and where pipe regularly leak and even freeze over in winter the conservatives literally do not fix the roof when the sun be shin on thursday the infrastructure and projects authority publish its annual report for its assessment of the new hospital programme read there be major issue with project definition schedule budget quality benefit delivery which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable the project may need re scope its overall viability reassess that be what this government have do our review of the new hospital programme and the announcement be make today will do two thing first it will put the programme on firm foot with sustainable funding so that all the project can be deliver and secondly it will give patient an honest realistic and deliverable timetable that they can believe in this labour government be rebuild our nhs and as we do so we will also rebuild trust in politic the seven hospital build wholly or mostly from reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete raac be outside the scope of the review these will be rebuild at pace to protect people safety also out of scope be the hospital already under construction or with an approve business case where building work have continue without delay work closely with my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury we have secure five year wave of investment back by billion of investment over consecutive wave average billion year that funding be in addition to the billion that the chancellor announce at the budget to tackle dangerous raac and the backlog of critical maintenance repair and upgrade across the nhs estate it

to answer any further question about these project to ensure that every penny of taxpayer money be well spend and every hospital be deliver as quickly as possible we will shortly launch new framework for the construction of the new scheme this will be different way of contracting by work in partnership with industry to mitigate cost schedule and delivery risk and save money through standardise design approach that will speed up the process of open new hospital and provide foundation for collaborative supply chain partnership we will also appoint programme delivery partner in the come week to support the delivery of crucial hospital infrastructure across the country and provide programme project and commercial expertise know that patient in some part of the country will be disappoint by this new timetable they be right to be they be lead up the garden path by three conservative prime ministers all promise hospital with no credible plan for funding to deliver they and by conservative mps who stand on manifesto promise they know could never be keep we will not treat the british people with the same contempt we will never play fast and loose with the public trust the plan that we have lay out today be honest fund and can actually be deliver it be serious credible plan to build the hospital that our nhs need it be part of the big capital investment that the nhs have see since labour be last in office deliver not just more hospital but new surgical hub community diagnostic centre ai enable scanner radiotherapy machine modern technology new mental health crisis centre and upgrade to hundred of gp estate it will take time but this labour government be determined to rebuild our nhs and rebuild trust in politic commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state be grateful as always to the secretary of state for his typical courtesy in give advance sight of his statement labour be prepared to make all sort of promise in opposition to win power it promise not to raise taxis on work people it say that it would not cut the winter fuel payment and it promise to deliver the new hospital programme but just as work people pensioner farmer and business have find this be labour government of broken promise they have cynically betray the trust of the british people the secretary of state and the chancellor travel the country to meet candidate who be promise new hospital in their local area in fact despite my right hon friend the member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins call they out in this very place in may last year warn that labour have say in the small print of its health mission that it be plan to pause all this capital investment the secretary of state be quote in the evening standard in june last year to have say we be committed to deliver the new hospitals programme those be seemingly hollow word now that those hospital be at risk with the investment and upgrade they deserve push back potentially to start in some case as late as voter put their trust in the labour party to deliver on its promise yet today they have be let down in response to claim that that be perhaps because of labour economic inheritance that simply do not reflect reality before the secretary of state warm to the theme of the mythical billion black hole he will know that the office for budget responsibility have simply fail to recognise that figure let we also be clear that due to the labour party and the chancellor financial mismanagement at the budget and the rise in gilt the bbc recently estimate that the cost of borrowing could be billion high over this parliament just imagine what the secretary of state could have announce today if the chancellor of the exchequer have not cause that to govern be to choose what to spend money on what to invest in and what not to invest in the secretary of state rightly point out that the darzi review highlight the need for more capital investment in the nhs yet he have decide not to prioritise the delivery of these new hospital in rapid fashion he will also know how the treasury allocate funding with cash earmark to the end of spending review period but not go across it until that comprehensive spending review formally conclude that be what his government be now do the secretary of state will be aware that the previous secretary of state my right hon friend the member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay be very clear about the billion anticipate in the next csr to fund this let be clear we prioritise the delivery of these new hospital as my right hon friend do in his statement on raac on may set out the government commitment to fund they this secretary of state have not replicate that we have clear plan with that funding commitment to be formalise at the csr to approve build and complete new hospital to definition akin to that use by tony blair when build new hospital which be already be design to standardised approach with modern method of construction the secretary of state have put that progress at risk will he confirm that in his csr discussion with the chancellor of the of the exchequer about the capital departmental expenditure limit cdel allocation for his department he will prioritise the new hospital programme when will the secretary of state set out to local people in each area exactly when construction will start declare an interest university hospitals of leicester nhs trust serve my constituent in each case when will the door actually open if the chancellor fail to get the economy grow and start look yet again for cut to fill the hole that she create with her budget will the secretary of state rule out any further delay what be his assessment of the effect of his lengthen the programme timescale on cost give inflationary pressure be all other previously approve capital project and programme safe from review can he possibly update the house via the library if not here on his late assessment of the impact of raac in those hospital which rightly he be continue to prioritise today announcement will come as bitter blow to trust staff and crucially patient who believe the labour party and will now be leave wait even long for vital investment yet again before the election they talk the talk but patient lose out when this government fail to deliver in yet again kick the can down the road as be increasingly their habit they have sadly betray the trust of the british people this weekend the leader of the opposition say that she will be honest about the mistake of the conservative government it seem that the shadow health secretary do not get the memo if the leader of the opposition be serious about show some contrition she might want to start here in the department of health and social care request fund from the treasury to rebuild the seven raac hospital that request be deny set back the necessary rebuild of those hospital by year the shadow secretary of state will remember this as he be minister in the department at the time which of his colleague be treasury minister when it block the rebuild of the raac hospital the leader of the opposition that be her record she should apologise once again like the arsonist return to the scene of the crime to criticise the fire brigade for not respond fast enough the conservatives have the audacity to come here and talk about failure to deliver when promise after promise be break the shadow secretary of state be the chief secretary to the treasury who have to come in to clean up the mess cause by liz truss mini budget that be what crash the economy look like they still have not have the decency even under new leadership to apologise if the shadow health secretary genuinely believe that all these project could be deliver by the commitment in the conservatives manifesto invite he to publish today their plan for do it how would he ensure the funding labour supply building material and planning to build the remain project in the next five year which capital programme would he cut which taxis would he increase he know as well as anyone that those be the choice that face government while he be do that can the shadow health secretary tell we what he can see that the national audit office the infrastructure and projects authority and the eye in my head can not see what be the conservatives plan past march when the money run out what taxis would they have raise wonder what capital project they would have cut in order to invest even more than we be in hospital building the big capital investment since labour be last in office while he be answer those question the shadow healthy secretary might want to reflect with the shadow cabinet and with member on the benches behind he on the other mess that this government be have to clear up as look around the cabinet table see an education secretary deal with crumble school justice secretary without enough prison place defence secretary deal with more dangerous world transport secretary have to rebuild our crumble infrastructure and deputy prime minister build the home we need in short deal with multiple crisis of the conservatives make there be massive rebuilding job to do in britain and we be get on with it think my point will be unlike that of any other member in the house the specialist emergency care hospital in sutton be in tier of these scheme can say to the secretary of state as have say to every health secretary over the past year that no one want this we want the service at st helier hospital to remain at st helier where the people who be poor and most ill need they will he look at this million pound scheme to see if it be really necessary my hon friend be absolutely right think that will be unique representation this afternoon can already hear the vulture swoop look for that capital allocation and slot in the pipeline she have make the case repeatedly forcefully and with conviction that these service should remain in community with high level of deprivation and high need know that the minister for secondary care my hon friend the member for bristol south karin smyth have already commit to meet she and we be very happy to have those conversation with she call the liberal democrat spokesperson in hampshire and across the country in and conservative mp stand on the promise of deliver new hospital include one for hampshire however it turn out that there be never any funding for that and that those be just false promise to try to get vote have fight tirelessly to save and improve winchester and consultant lead maternity unit with the announcement that construction of propose new hospital in hampshire will not even start until between and we absolutely need to ensure that the current service be invest in and improve so that they remain fit for purpose give that the new hospital programme be delay it be more urgent than ever to increase capacity by fix social care so that those who be well enough to leave hospital can be care for in the community thus free up bed immediately we can not endure both insufficient social care package and crumble hospital give this delay to the new hospital programme will the secretary of state commit to prioritise more social care package now rather than wait three year for review to be complete although the health secretary be not responsible for the state of the nhs or the state of the economy which the government inherit the new hospital programme be see as part of the solution to the crisis in the nhs and people across the sector have warn that delay the programme will only mean more treatment cancel and more money waste plug hole in hospital building that be no long fit for purpose we be therefore concerned that one of the big announcement to affect the nhs over the next few year be come out right now during donald trump inauguration because it will not get the medium attention it deserve liberal democrats therefore urge the health secretary to promise to release full impact assessment on how the delay to the new hospital programme will affect patient and nhs staff will take those point in turn with enormous respect for the momentous democratic event take place in washington today do not think that the new president last time check have declare an interest in any of our hospital scheme be sure he will forgive we for get on with the job of british government even as the american handover take place commit some time ago to come to the house in the new year have keep that promise and dare say that the decision that we be take and set out today will receive good coverage reassure the hon gentleman and other member across the house with an interest in particular scheme that my hon friend the minister for secondary care and official from the programme team will be happy to meet as early as tomorrow to take question on individual scheme the hon gentleman raise broad challenge for the nhs and social care pressure in our country that be why the chancellor prioritise investment in our nhs and social care service in the budget with billion of additional funding for my department of health and social care on social care specifically we have take number of action in our first six month fair pay agreement for care professional the big expansion of the carer allowance since the and an uplift in funding for local authority include specific ringfence funding for social care we will be set out further reform throughout this year as well as phase of the casey commission report next year for the duration for this parliament opposition members can not have it both way they can not keep on welcome the investment and oppose the mean of raise it if they do not support the chancellor budget which be their democratic right they have to say which service they would cut or which alternative taxis they would raise welcome to opposition folk we ve be there enjoy the ride you be there for some time finally let just say this to the liberal democrats who have constructively raise range of challenge this be at the heart of the challenge face this government the hon gentleman be right to mention the capital challenge face the secondary care estate the same be true of the primary care estate and of the community and mental health estate as have spell out every single one of my cabinet colleague also have significant capital pressure that be the consequence of year of under investment in our public infrastructure and in our public service which mean that we be pay hell of lot more for the conservatives failure than we would have if they have build on rather than demolish labour record of the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in history today announcement be welcome for my constituent it confirm that we be keep the promise we make in to deliver hillingdon hospital in the first term of labour government thank my right hon friend for that commitment we also know that shamefully my predecessor and his predecessor mislead my constituent my predecessor stand here almost where be stand today and tell my constituent that hillingdon hospital be fully fund and that

quite right to say that his predecessor and his predecessor predecessor make claim about hillingdon hospital that be not true this government will not make those mistake we will keep our promise what we have set out for all scheme in the new hospital programme be credible realistic funded timetable that this government for as long as there be labour government will actually deliver call the father of the house will the secretary of state forgive if give the house few second respite from the blame game by try to make positive suggestion everyone accept that the real problem face our hospital be the number of frail and elderly people who do not need to be in hospital and should be in some sort of care facility do the secretary of state agree that while build brand new all singing all dance hospital be very expensive there be future for small cottage hospital such as the one in gainsborough and case for open other facility so we can move elderly frail people out of those big hospital into caring environment and free up space thank the right hon gentleman for rare constructive contribution from the conservative benches not rare from he for he be regularly constructive it be the rest of the conservative party that we have problem with let reassure he that one thing we be determined to do be deliver shift in the centre of gravity out of hospital and into community with care close to home and indeed in people home as see on visit to carlisle over the new year good intermediate step down accommodation sometimes provide well quality and more appropriate care and well value for the taxpayer that intermediate care facility in carlisle fund through the nhs by social care setting be provide great quality rehabilitation in nice environment at half the cost of the nhs bed up the road this government will deliver both well care and well value for taxpayer be really glad that my right hon friend have grip on the hospital building programme and have develop pipeline for

election be call there be clear indication from the government that they intend to fund the million reconstruction of the maternity unit at the qeqm hospital in margate which emerge from the bill kirkup report will be grateful if the secretary of state can tell whether it be his intention to ensure that that funding be make available the right hon gentleman refer to the number of house that the secretary of state for housing communities and local government be determined to see build could he explain for the sake of east kent how the primary and secondary healthcare service will be provide to meet the need of the people who will live in those house be very aware of the challenge in east kent and the challenge of provide good quality care and the facility that people need be sure that ministers will be happy to receive representation from the right hon gentleman the right hon gentleman ask about the government commitment to build million more home let reassure he and the house that the deputy prime minister and as well as other member of the cabinet be discuss very carefully how we can make sure that alongside the new home that our country need we have the infrastructure and the public service that people deserve my predecessor in chelsea and fulham claim to have secure funding for charing cross hospital that claim go out on election literature throughout the constituency at the time doubt it today announcement confirm beyond any doubt that the money be not there what he be say be not true welcome the honesty and realism of the government statement today it be about time the british people have government play straight with they and tell they the truth interruption instead of laugh and jeering from the conservative benches which be of no use to my constituent in chelsea and fulham who be promise the money for charing cross hospital when it be never there would like to see some contrition on more positive note can the secretary of state assure my constituent that the timetable that he have set out will be meet can give my hon friend that assurance thank he for the very strong representation that he have make on behalf of his local trust since his election to this house be afraid that the extent to which promise be make about this scheme that could not be keep be shameful can reassure he that pre construction work will take place between and as he know this be not straightforward project but it be one to which we be very much committed with construction due to start around be very happy to continue to work with my hon friend and with neighbouring right hon and hon member to make sure that the trust be support during that period give the day to day challenge that it face the acute hospital that serve most of my constituency be the royal lancaster infirmary it be an overcrowded victorian hospital part of it be fall to bit it have inadequate parking and it be at the wrong end of one way system with the secretary of state help the local hospital trust have acquire an almost perfect site for rebuild the trust have design the new hospital and even begin consult the public on it so today announcement that we face year wait until spade be dig into the ground will come as something of bombshell will he reconsider the timescale the long we leave it the more the cost will spiral and be afraid the less likely it be that people will have confidence that it will even happen at all on the hon gentleman final point can well understand why people across the country will be cynical about commitment make on hospital give the experience that they have under our conservative predecessor even if not every decision that we be take be universally popular hope that people will appreciate our up front candour and honesty in not try to pull the wool over their eye and in set out in today report in term the timetable for pre construction work and for start construction in the particular case that the hon gentleman raise hope that the fact that land be acquire by this government in december signal our absolute commitment to the scheme if we be not commit to the scheme we would not have make the land purchase up front ahead of pre construction work which be plan for we do so because we absolutely accept the case that he make about the desirability of the site and the need for investment and the new hospital locally in addition to the representation from the hon gentleman my hon friend the member for lancaster and wyre cat smith win the award for be the first mp to collar straight after the election to say buy this land and do it now after year of broken tory promise on new hospital can the secretary of state confirm today that follow this review my constituent in blaydon and consett

that be leave behind by the conservatives this announcement will come as terrible blow to the people serve by basingstoke and north hampshire hospital particularly after the very personal commitment make by the now prime minister in june we assume from what the secretary of state have say today that come the spending review the government will set out detailed capital budget stretch into the can he tell we in the meantime what his announcement will do to his projection for operating cost for repair and maintenance cost and for the provision of stopgap facility where they be need give that the right hon gentleman serve in the cabinet under successive conservative governments he have some brass neck frankly in turn up today and complain in the way that he have he want to talk about the cost place on the country but he should look in the mirror and consider the cost that he and his colleague in government lumber this country with when they impose over decade of austerity of trussonomics and the bad sort of kamikaze ideological project that this country have experience in modern time would just remind the right hon remind he and those on the conservative benches who be live in an alternate reality where they bear no responsibility for their action of only month ago that the national audit office say by the definition the government use in it will not now deliver new hospital by the infrastructure and projects authority give the scheme red rating say that the project appear to be unachievable the project may need re scope its overall viability reassess what on earth do he think that record do for nhs manager give the stop start stop start what on earth do he think that do to community who be seek certainty and assume that the promise make by the conservatives would be keep they say in their manifesto only last july that they would deliver new hospital by well accord to the nao definition and the ipa report that promise be never go to be keep they know it they do not care they just say what they want to try to win vote and that be disgraceful rise order member will have see how many people be on their foot want to ask the secretary of state question could ask members please to try to keep their question and answer quite short want to try to get everybody in if at all possible my right hon friend statement stand in sharp contrast to that make on may by the previous secretary of state when he completely forget to put in his statement both write and verbal north manchester general hospital be pleased that north manchester general hospital be today in the first wave but would be grateful if my right hon friend could spell out in detail when the work will continue because in one of the area of the country with the bad health outcome it be not only

basingstoke luke murphy who be in the chamber will be consider his position give the promise he make be we able to rescue something from this wreckage by purchase the site as the secretary of state will know we be now likely to lose the land it be critical site so can we please buy it before it slip from our grasp we be happy to receive sensible representation from member about their project as

discuss the rebuild of the raac infest airedale general hospital reiterate my thank on behalf of my constituent who be be treat in ward with prop up ceiling for his and the ministerial team commitment to ensure that this vital new hospital go ahead with deliverable timetable and sustainable funding plan do my right hon friend agree that the previous government commitment to deliver new hospital by be as the nao conclude disingenuous and unrealistic be grateful to my hon friend for her question we be very fortunate to have in the house someone with her experience of social care and health issue she have already do an outstanding job represent her constituent who know will not only welcome the news that airedale general hospital will begin construction in but will be appal that as raac hospital work could have be well under way have the department request for funding not be deny by the woman who be now the leader of the conservative party sympathise with the secretary of state for have to pull these project out of the fire of non funding and thank he for the announcement on the woman and child hospital in cornwall know that all my parliamentary colleague in cornwall will be delighted at today news sympathise with colleague who find themselves in wave and what can the secretary of state do to crack on with the enable work to ensure that this project be deliver in double quick time it be desperately need and finish date will be challenge for cornwall it would be much appreciated if it could be bring forward be grateful for the way in which the hon gentleman pose his question can confirm that pre construction work be ongoing with construction due to start between and lot have be say about what my party say before the election and will give opposition members role model in how to do honesty ahead of an election stand outside the royal cornwall hospital and be ask by local medium whether would commit to specific timetable and say we have commit to the new hospital programme we be committed to see through the new woman and child hospital at the royal cornwall and know that enable work be under way beyond that we be go to take an honest look at the book that be the approach take as shadow health and social care secretary and that be how to do it to under promise and then over deliver leed general infirmary receive outline planning permission in two conservative prime ministers come to leeds and promise that we would get our new hospital despite know that the funding be not there in the treasury thank my right hon friend for visit the lgi now that we know we be in wave will he meet and the chief executive to talk about one of the large maintenance backlog in the nhs how we be go to cope in the intervene period and how we be go to move forward and hit wave run to get our hospital build before we need to close down our child service which be at risk be grateful to my hon friend for highlight the extent to which leed general infirmary be let down over year of conservative government with initial under investment follow by total inactivity apart from big pile of dirt outside the hospital which go to see with the then shadow chancellor the chancellor and be both commit to the project we know how important it be we have have to phase the programme so we can say it be genuinely affordable deliverable and credible on this timetable reassure my hon friend that pre construction work will take place over to with construction due to start in to we would be delighted to receive representation from mps from his city and across the region about the support we provide to the trust in the meantime airedale hospital have some of the bad raac of all the hospital on the new hospital programme all the survey have say that give the risk profile associate with raac part of the hospital will have no life expectancy beyond which be why the completion date of be so important with fund have be allocate to the project for it to be deliver it be disappointing to hear today that the start date will be between and when be it likely that the new rebuild airedale hospital will open will the health secretary provide the trust with confidence that additional fund will be available to help with the mitigation that need to take place before the new hospital can open to keep the exist hospital operational if the hon gentleman be disappoint with this government he will be absolutely furious when he find out who be in power before in fact he be dead ringer for the guy use to see on the conservative benches cheer on and vote for every calamitous decision the conservative government take include crash the economy and support the now leader of the opposition when she reject appeal to fund raac hospital we be prioritise those hospital and go as fast as we can the rebuilding will happen under labour government but it do not happen under the tories do it welcome the honesty with which my right hon friend be approach this matter because government should not make false promise have the chance to visit couple of the raac hospital and the public accounts committee which use to chair examine hospital the standardised approach he talk about it contain some quite startling assumption so will he assure and the house that he have look into those in detail and that we be absolutely sure about the date of delivery

secretary of state talk we through how operational budget will be increase at hospital such as the royal berkshire which currently have backlog of repair of over million that could stop operation and procedure happen how will the government ensure that money be in place while we wait year for our new hospital will be get to slightly early than the hon gentleman as it be my birthday tomorrow look forward to the card in the post more seriously on the phasing of the programme we have take an approach that ensure that we can stand up and look his constituent and other in the eye and say that we have an affordable programme that can be deliver accord to the timetable that be set out know people will be disappoint by the length of time it will take and be genuinely sorry that they be lead up the garden path by our predecessor that be why we have take an approach that say that honesty be the good policy we would rather be up front about the length of time and in the meantime ensure we be deliver the investment and reform need to reduce waiting time and improve primary community and social care service so even as work continue to prepare for the royal berkshire hospital scheme his constituent and other across berkshire will begin to experience an improve nhs under labour as oppose to the broken one they experience under the conservatives while welcome the firm commitment that the secretary of state have make to new royal berkshire hospital my constituent will share my disappointment at the delay to its construction agree that the blame for the delay lie squarely with the conservatives who promise new hospital without set aside the money to pay for they but will my right hon friend visit the royal berkshire hospital to discuss the interim capital funding that we will need as we wait for wave and to see for himself how important it be that our new hospital be build as soon as possible no one have fight hard for the royal berkshire hospital scheme than my hon friend and our hon friend the members for earley and woodley yuan yang and for read central matt rodda who be sit beside she they have work incredibly hard as team to make the case for investment in health and social care across berkshire would be delighted to visit because she be right that even as people wait for this particular hospital scheme there be lot that we can must and will do to improve health and social care service across her constituency and across berkshire look forward to work with my hon friend to achieve that the health secretary have recognise the urgency of replace the queen elizabeth hospital in king lynn due to the raac safety issue my constituent and be grateful for that it reflect the position of the last conservative government in his statement he say that he be work at pace to rebuild qeh so will he instruct the nhs to expedite the business case approval for the new multi storey car park which be the key enable project and will he commit to the deadline which be the end of life of the hospital we recognise the challenge of raac in the queen elizabeth hospital in king lynn and take that approach from the outset can confirm that the programme will start construction in it be due to complete in but will be prioritise for expedition as raac scheme if we can go fast we will today be set out credible timetable if we be able to under promise and over deliver will be delighted but reassure the hon gentleman that we be go as far and as fast as we can give the safety challenge if he be not happy with the pace he should reflect on the fact that one of the local mps be former prime minister she have the chance to get on with it hope do not get legal letter but she do not deliver do she for nearly year have be part of campaign to either save or rebuild whipps cross hospital for the last year have stand shoulder to shoulder with the secretary of state so know let put this on the record for he because he can not say it his pain and frustration that we be now talk about eight year to restart the building work that have already start at whipps cross and which will finally deliver the new hospital that we need and thousand new home in our community it be devastating to we all but we can see from the list that some hospital have move between the different wave give that and give the example of funding source that can be put together will he organise an urgent meeting we know about his conflict of interest for all mp whose constituent use whipps cross to look at the criterion and possible new source of funding know that he will agree that we owe it to our constituent not to give up fighting for the hospital that our community so desperately need as my hon friend say must declare an interest as whipps cross hospital and barts health nhs trust serve my constituent would be delighted to lead delegation with she to lobby the minister of state for health my hon friend the member for bristol south karin smyth who have to take decision on scheme that affect my constituency it would be nice to be on the other side of exchange for the first time in while let reassure the constituent of my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy and my own that pre construction work on whipps cross hospital be due to begin in to with construction begin in to my constituent know well enough to know that if we could go fast we would do so on alternative investment vehicle and mean of raise additional capital investment not to mention learn from some of the less successful initiative of the past would be delighted to work with treasury colleague and government members on how we can get more capital investment but for reason that she will well understand we need to tread carefully on that point the secretary of state inherit torbay hospital where we have have almost sewage leak many of which have impact clinical area of the hospital and sadly that be set to continue the hospital operate at bed capacity which only result in poor service for resident and that be set to continue will he reflect on the fact that many people in torbay will fear they have suffer the impact of the national insurance hike in our low wage economy but without see much of the gain for our hospital say two thing to the hon gentleman first we recognise the need for investment in torbay hospital we be committed to it and that be what this programme commit we to deliver with pre construction work begin from to and construction begin in to secondly say to he and other opposition members who oppose the decision that the chancellor take in the budget that they can not welcome the investment on one hand and oppose the mean of raise it on the other unless of course they spell out which service they would cut or which alternative taxis they would increase that be the challenge we face the chancellor have have to do hell of lot of heavy lifting to clean up the mess leave by the conservatives and support her decision thank the secretary of state he be do what he should be do and what should have be do before tell truth to the people and the commons will not waste any time urge the secretary of state to get his appropriate minister if not himself to visit whiston hospital and st helens local authority they will show he how thing can work well than at present with proper integrate health and social care ask he to please pay visit it be worth it he can not afford not to go there an offer can refuse my hon friend be great champion of health and care service in her community and have enormous experience in local government we be always look for good practice we want to take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs and we would be delighted to hear more about the success in her community as the secretary of state will be aware and mp from surround constituency write to he at the beginning of december to talk about watford general hospital be sure that speak on behalf of the two labour mp one lib dem and conservative colleague when say we be disappointed that he have decide to delay reconstruction of watford general until at least notwithstanding my public disappointment and give that all six of we campaign actively on investment in watford general the statement say that further detail will be provide in the hospital building programme if there be assumption there that we wish to challenge such as build cost do we go to the secretary of state or the minister of state with those question the minister of state my hon friend the member for bristol south karin smyth will be hold briefing tomorrow for member from across the house and be happy to receive further question the hon member seem to be say on the one hand to go fast and on the other that he want to challenge underlying assumption in the scheme he can not have it both way as say to some of his hon friend if he be disappoint with this government as we clean up the mess they leave behind goodness know the self loathing he feel when they be in government feel doubly bless this afternoon because the west suffolk hospital in my constituency be to be rebuild and the james paget hospital where have work for year be to be rebuild do the secretary of state agree that our primary care estate be in terrible situation and that we must also invest in general practice facility with that track record my hon friend might want to tell we this week lottery number while he be here in all seriousness he make good point although today statement be about the new hospital programme the challenge across the health and social care estate be enormous that be why the chancellor commit at budget to the capital investment that will deliver not only this programme but significant investment in the general practice estate we have an enormous array of capital challenge in health and social care ask members on both side of the house to bear in mind that while have to struggle to weigh up the compete priority across the health and social care budget the chancellor and the chief secretary to the treasury have to do so not only for health and social care but for education transport defence justice the police estate right across the board we have inherit country leave in an enormous hole we be take the necessary decision to get our country out of that hole and beat path to well future one of the hospital that my constituent and wide buckinghamshire resident rely on for treatment be wycombe hospital it be not raac hospital but severe maintenance issue in the age tower mean that it be lose about hour of operating time per year in the spirit of the transparency that the secretary of state speak of will he tell the house where the elongation of the new hospital programme leave the work at wycombe hospital and will he meet to discuss constructively how to move that work forward so that wycombe can get the new surgical hub that it need be always open to constructive representation as say in my statement the capital envelope that the chancellor have give my department the big since labour be last in office include fund for exactly those sort of maintenance backlog and disrepair challenge in the nhs estate it be not just about new unit or hospital it be also about ensure that the current estate can deliver the quality of care and the value for money that our constituent deserve would be happy to take representation from the hon gentleman the conservatives make promise about new hospital that they know they could not build and deliver and now it turn out that they know they could not pay for they by it be little wonder that trust in politic be so low at the moment it be also little wonder give the unedifye display from conservative front benchers today that they be sit on the opposition benches it fall on this government to take the decision that the conservatives duck when they be in power give that trust be so low what reassurance can the secretary of state give my constituent that the leeds general infirmary will be deliver accord to the timetable that he have set out today be grateful to my hon friend for his representation and for his outstanding work for the people of leeds since his election can reassure his constituent that this be credible and funded timetable that we can stick to and be determined to ensure that we do as for promise make by the conservatives we see the crocodile tear from the leader of the opposition this weekend she say that she will admit that the conservatives get thing wrong but she never ever give specific example in fact we have hear more about steak sandwich than humble pie since the election the previous conservative government promise the people of west hertfordshire that we would have new hospital and they even claim that it be fully fund so our sense of betrayal be incredibly acute today the labour government have announce that the rebuild start for watford general hospital have be push back by seven to nine year without minister have even visit the hospital even though it be shovel ready we have the land we have the planning permission and we have do the enable work so can the secretary of state say why hospital be ahead of watford general and what money will be make available for repair bill which will inevitably pile up possibly for the good part of decade while our hospital be leave to crumble can well understand the hon member anger on behalf of her st albans constituent who be invest in this project as be the constituent of my hon friend the members for watford matt turmaine and for hemel hempstead david taylor she will be able to see in the report which we be place online and in the library the methodology that we follow to assess prioritisation and ordering of scheme which be about affordability deliverability and the other factor that she would expect we to take into account that be how we reach today decision can reassure she and her constituent that pre construction work will begin from to with construction begin in to those of her constituent who be angry about the delay do not need to be tell where the blame lie that be why they return liberal democrat mp instead of conservative rise order plan to run this statement until so ask member to please help each other out by keep their question and answer short my predecessor tell my constituent that the work on kettering general hospital be ready to go it be shameful that in reality the conservatives have no credible plan and the money be go to run out in march this year do the secretary of state agree that people in kettering be right to be angry at the previous government for break their promise and can he reassure my constituent that they will see realistic deliverable timeframe for the rebuild of our hospital be grateful to my hon friend who have raise this issue consistently and persistently with since she be elect can reassure she and her constituent that pre construction work will begin from to with construction start in and last until be extremely sorry that my hon friend constituent be lead up the garden path rather feel that they have already rumble the conservatives by send she to parliament but for as long as there be labour government we will deliver for the people of kettering will say it because no one else have many happy return for tomorrow genuinely think that you be in your that the secretary of state be in his and madam deputy speaker laughter she happy with that also congratulate the secretary of state on come to the chamber with such massive capital expenditure announcement and elicit saving with his answer to the first question from the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh one of the plan that go by the board in may for reason have not quite get to the bottom of be for the staines health and wellbeing centre which be one of only six community diagnostic hub that nhs england have allocate in england the funding get pull in may will the secretary of state please have another look at it thank the hon gentleman very much for that question think he be go to go far in this place madam deputy speaker and would be delighted to look favourably on his representation about his local facility my local hospital be not select for the new hospital programme while be happy for colleague who have receive some certainty today on when work on their local hospital will start do the secretary of state recognise that there be hospital the length and breadth of this country that be fall apart and that staff and patient deserve well will he commit to consider wide estate plan for the rest of the nhs estate especially in east kent be grateful to my hon friend for his question and for the outstanding work he have do represent his constituent since his election he make the really important point that of the record investment that the chancellor and the chief secretary to the treasury have give to my department for capital investment the big allocation since labour be last in billion year be allocate for the new hospital programme eagle eyed people have notice that sum much large than billion year be available for capital investment precisely because there be need for improvement and modernisation of the exist estate right across the health and social care estate as know from the representation that be pile into my inbox from my constituent who use queen hospital in romford can assure my hon friend that we be look across the board at the capital need in the nhs and social care and prioritise accordingly and would be delighted to receive his representation hinchingbrooke hospital in huntingdon be one of the raac hospital for which funding have already be approve that hospital will not be allocate grid space until quarter of but it will need it by in order to keep the build on track additionally traffic around the hospital be frequently gridlocke vital new access road be part of the plan but the land where it would go be own by cambridgeshire constabulary and national highways who be yet to give up the additional land they acquire via compulsory purchase order when construct view common road will the health secretary meet in order to work through those blocker give that they be all be cause by government agency and meet hinchingbrooke hospital delivery date and can he confirm that the date be still the target be grateful to the hon member for his representation this government be on the side of the builder not the blocker can confirm to he that we be determined to start hinchingbrooke in we work closely with the local project team but we would be delighted to receive representation about his frustration with the delivery of that project the last time the secretary of state come to the chamber to talk about the new hospital programme share the story of take my year old grandmother to accident and emergency at milton keynes hospital only to be tell when we get there that the wait time be nine and half hour be afraid to say she be back there again early this month and despite the tireless effort of our incredible nhs staff the brutal reality of year of tory neglect mean she do not get the care she desperately need and deserve however it be not just my family this be the live experience of countless people across my constituency on behalf of my grandmother my family my friend and my neighbour thank the secretary of state for do what the previous government fail to do which be secure the extra funding need for the new hospital in milton keynes can ask that he continue to work with and the other mps across milton keynes to ensure we get spade in the ground as soon as possible be extremely grateful to my hon friend who have do so much with his parliamentary neighbour in milton keynes and bletchley to get this scheme deliver and go as fast as possible he underline how important this be it be not just about brick and mortar it be about people life and life chance he really bring that home with his powerful contribution can reassure he that pre construction work be ongoing with construction due to begin in which know will be welcome by people who use the hospital right across milton keynes and beyond my former constituency neighbour councillor steve tuckwell chair the planning committee that grant permission for the new hillingdon hospital which serve my constituent for full disclosure my wife work there as an nhs doctor those of we who be local resident see pre construction work under way include sewerage electric and demolition and strip out begin in the building will the secretary of state apologise to my constituent affect by this for the delay that he have introduce to this project will he consider lobby the chancellor and the prime minister to cancel the chagos island deal the cost of which alone would fund new nhs hospital it be truly extraordinary that we have conservative member stand up and criticise labour government for deliver the hillingdon hospital project which will begin construction not pre works but deliver in as promise the people of hillingdon that be what we be deliver and people should judge the contrast between labour government who be deliver and not just conservative members but conservative prime minister who make promise on the hospital do not follow through and walk away leave we to pick up the piece first say happy birthday to the secretary of state for tomorrow can not think of well birthday present than to give the people of milton keynes new woman and child hospital we be grow city and nowhere be it more need in term of population per bed will he reassure my constituent that the money have be find and allocate because they feel they be take for mug after the scheme be announce by the previous government and the previous mps more than four time but be never fund and never deliver be grateful to my hon friend for her birthday wish even after announce the timetable that know she and her constituent want on serious note think people will see the contrast between send conservative member from milton keynes with inaction and broken promise and send labour member from milton keynes who be deliver be delighted with the work and improvement we will be able to deliver for her constituent hope member right across the house whichever wave their hospital be in know that this government have set out timetable that be credible and deliverable and funding package that will be deliver for as long as there be labour government my constituent in north devon be let down by the previous government and they will be utterly dismay to find that the remotest hospital in england have be pass over again for essential repair it be now beyond do the department understand that if critical care and operating theatre facility begin to fail within the next five year as expect there be no alternative critical care for patient for over mile invite the secretary of state to come to see for himself why investment be need now and to visit north devon district hospital because it have not have ministerial visit from this government be grateful to the hon member for his question can tell his constituent that since his arrival he have be absolutely dog in pursuit of health and care investment in his community say to his constituent that we will deliver against this timetable the funding be there and it will be there for as long as there be labour government in the meantime we would be happy to work with he to make sure that rural community such as his receive the investment they need and my hon friend the minister for secondary care or would be delighted to visit at some point soon there be no doubt but that this statement will be meet with deal of anger and frustration by my constituent the hospital in basingstoke be badly need and they be not get the healthcare they deserve the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse call on to consider my position would call on he be he still in his place to consider his connection with reality because there be absolutely no doubt where the blame for that anger and frustration should lie and that be with conservative members interruption they repeatedly tell my constituent that the hospital be fund it be not they tell we it would be deliver by but they themselves delay this fictitious plan until and the right hon member have the gall to ask to consider my position be surprised he could make it to the chamber today so weigh down he must have be by his brass neck that bring to my question welcome the clarity that the secretary of state have bring to the scheme and to the house today number of the hospital in cohort which include basingstoke hospital have be move forward such as the hospital in milton keynes and kettering be of course delighted for my colleague but would be interested to know why they have be move but basingstoke be where it be what confidence can the secretary of state give my constituent that under our plan unlike the previous government they can be confident that basingstoke hospital will be deliver as we have set out be grateful to my hon friend for his question be not surprised that conservative members try to shout he down they want to silence criticism of their record because they be ashamed of it that be simple fact he be absolutely right about his parliamentary neighbour who sit around the cabinet table of the notorious liz truss even as she crash the economy and then have the temerity to turn up and lecture other people about the sound management of public money these people have no shame whatsoever and they will have no credibility until they sincerely and honestly apologise to the country for the mess they make be very happy to talk through with my hon friend and his constituent why his project have be phase as it have there be number of constrain factor not just resource but other factor such as allocation of land plan and so on but reassure his constituent that we will deliver also reassure his constituent that since his arrival in this place he have be absolutely dog and determine in speak up for they and lobby on their behalf welcome the secretary of state clarification on the timing of the new sutton specialist hospital which will serve my constituency be really pleased that the project be go ahead although the delay be disappointing the current situation at epsom and st helier university hospital nhs trust be not sustainable the trust currently run duplicate service across two site which make staffing incredibly difficult the physical estate be deteriorate fast than it can be fix and some of the building be old than the nhs itself could the secretary of state set out how he intend to reduce waiting list in reigate redhill banstead and our village in the short term in the light of the delay to this project can reassure the hon member that the hospital be due to start construction from to although my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh have other idea on cut waiting time just early this month the prime minister and publish this government elective reform plan so that we can deliver the week standard for referral to treatment which have not be meet for decade have the hon member be here during the last parliament she would have be absolutely shocked at where the conservatives lead we from the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction under labour to the high waiting list and low patient satisfaction on record trust in the delivery of healthcare for my constituent have be damage by year of fail nhs policy and fake tory promise for new hospital the tories know full well that they do not have the money to deliver they they visit whipps cross five time for announcement but deliver nothing not brick not penny and certainly no hospital although the delay confirm today be disappointing we welcome the honesty and the work to mitigate the impact of tory failure the campaign for whipps cross hospital be not over however as the secretary of state team know we will continue to make other departments aware of the impact on their housing programme and continue to seek their support on his behalf be grateful for his remark early about meeting to look at alternative funding method will the secretary of state confirm that funding for remediation and maintenance work will be make available to get our hospital to its wave start line be grateful to my parliamentary neighbour for his representation and reassure he and his constituent and mine for that matter that thank to the capital allocation at the budget provide by the chancellor and the chief secretary to the treasury who be in his place we will be invest more in capital than at any point since labour be last in office because we recognise the capital funding pressure right across the nhs estate we be determined to meet those pressure and clear up the mess that the conservatives leave behind know that across the house and the country there will be real anger at the promise make by the conservatives when people see that the timetable be work of fiction and the money be not there hope it be of some reassurance to know that this secretary of state represent community that be also feel let down by the action of the conservatives as do the chancellor of the exchequer the way in which we have phase this scheme and the fact that both our scheme be in wave should reassure people that we be do as much as we can as fast as we can within the constraint hope that people will take some comfort from the honesty credibility and affordability of the timetable we be set out today as long as there be labour government the new hospital programme will be deliver office for value for money treasury committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement on behalf of the treasury committee dame meg hillier will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of her statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair not the relevant government minister front benchers may take part in questioning it give great pleasure to make statement on the first report of the treasury committee in this parliament and again thank the house for give the honour of occupy this position our first report be on the new office for value for money there will not be single member who do not believe in value for money for our constituent who pay for government service through hard earn taxis that they give grudgingly to be spend well as the chancellor herself have be very clear the taxpayer be not an automatic cash machine and every penny of taxpayer money need to be spend as well as possible the notion of value for money be one we would all support we also need transparency and that be large part of the role of select committees to shine light on government action this be our first public report shin light on the work of the treasury the office for value for money be short lived year long body that be expect to have staff include secondee from the national audit office and the evaluation taskforce in the cabinet office it be head by chair who tell we that it would conduct small number of study mainly on cross departmental basis to identify well value for money across government when we speak to the chair in our hearing at the end of december we find that although it be suppose to have member of staff it only have and all be below director general level so not the most senior civil servant that total of and the ultimate total of will include secondee it have not rule out in december use external consultant to bolster the skill it will need to deliver on its work it have not yet decide at the end of december into which area it would launch study and nor have it set the parameter for evaluate its effectiveness the committee be clear that have body with name we would all agree with the principle of be not enough we want to see such body deliver for our constituent we highlight in our report that there be risk of duplication there be already large number of body across government that deliver on value for money scrutinise government and shine light on how money be spend the national audit office which have nearly staff in newcastle and london the evaluation taskforce in the cabinet office which evaluate project across government to make sure they be properly deliver the new national infrastructure and service transformation authority which will be operational in the spring and bring together the previous infrastructure and projects authority in slightly different format there be also unit in departments that work to deliver on value for money in range of area in particular the new arrangement for the department for science innovation and technology with its centre for digital transformation of public service the cabinet office also have readiness programme base on regulation arise from the procurement act call transform public procurement there be also the rainbow of book if we walk into the treasury and ask question about the green book the teal book and the magenta book and there be other we will learn that be an important infrastructure for how it issue guidance the green book appraise policy programme and project the teal book provide guidance on project delivery in government include manage project programme and portfolio that have be in an internal trial since july the magenta book provide treasury guidance on what to consider when design evaluation there be also number of framework include the government efficiency framework and the public value framework dataset be also provide include the priority outcome and metric first set out in the spending review of one of the most crucial element in deliver value for money be that every department have outcome delivery plan address the meat and drink of what be go on in government as secretary of state sit and plan what they might have to deliver in the spending review come up in june they will be pore over those outcome delivery plan as they do their departmental review each department will have its own review to look at where money be be spend and what project be be deliver overarch this there be manage public money which cover the approach of all permanent secretary who be the accounting officer and be therefore responsible for answer for how taxpayer money be spend through the accounting process of government their accounting officer assessment have to fit in with that regime we all want to see value for money but this young body be one year long and be not yet well establish the risk of duplication be high and we need to ensure that it deliver something special and different and crucially that nowhere in the office for value for money will ministers be play role they will have key role in deliver on the spending review but in my experience of over decade of scrutinise public spending ministers can make promise but they be not always well deliver which can drive up public spending if we be not careful it be vitally important that this body deliver as set out so we have ask the treasury to explain in more precise detail what it expect the office for value for money to deliver how it will evaluate its success and what it want to see in the long term from this body chair by david goldstone we wish this body well but the committee be clear that at the moment there be number of area of concern about whether it will actually deliver what it be set out to do congratulate the hon lady not only on her excellent chairing of our committee and this report but on secure slot in the chamber to tell people about some of the report recommendation her background as the former chair of the public accounts committee give huge credibility to the point she be make about the possibility that this new and temporary body will not be able to make its mark in the way the government hop one of the area where my constituency have benefit most in value for money from public spending be flood defence with her long experience do she agree that protect our community from the impact of climate change be one of the good us of public money the hon lady the former chair of the treasury committee she still serve on the committee highlight pertinent point the chair of the office for value for money say that it be not just about cash cost and that sometimes it might want to look at programme that will save cost in the long run however that be still ill define and we need to hear more detail because that be the holy grail really if we can spend to save that benefit our taxpayer in the long run in cash and in the case of flooding in particular it prevent something that be catastrophic for many community call the shadow minister join other in thank the hon lady and her committee for produce this report give the increase pressure on public expenditure since the budget the report be timely the picture it paint be that the office for value for money remit be vague its personnel be limited time be tight and other established group be already in place and there be therefore concern that its effort may dissipate it be clear that it can not do everything the chief secretary to the treasury be here and understand that the chair of the office for value for money be clear that there be few area he will be look at do the chair of the committee agree that it would be of value for those area of investigation to be make clear and public so that we can more clearly monitor where their impact could be feel the hon gentleman be say what we say in the report as cross party select committee of the house we say that we need more detail about what will come the chair of the office for value for money be in front of we before christmas and we recognise that give the body have only be establish in october he might not have all the answer but we need those with dispatch if this body be to be disband in october and be to contribute meaningfully to this spending review although we recognise that would be challenge within the timeframe if he be to lay down marker for genuine value for money and well spending by government in the long term we need precision we have ask the treasury for that and hopefully it will respond to we in quick time it have to respond to we whether it want to or not with answer we also need to evaluate the effectiveness in term of whether when the office for value for money come up with its study and thing they will have to be take on by the treasury we want to know the mechanism for that and how the treasury will prove to this house and taxpayer that the body have make big difference value for money in public spending be important to my constituent who work hard for their money in scotland under the scottish national party we have high rate of income tax for anyone earn more than the government in edinburgh and the uk government that we have just finish with have indulge in some shocking waste of money do my hon friend agree that it be essential for the office for value for money to set out its suggestion for way of secure value for money for future reference in both london and edinburgh my hon friend highlight an important point that have mention already our constituent give the government their hard earn money in the belief and hope that they will spend it wisely it be important that the treasury be clear about what it expect to get out of the office for value for money and as result of that work thereby prove to the house voter and taxpayer that it be get well value than it would have do have the office for value for money not exist congratulate the hon member on her excellent chairing of our committee and on this excellent report give that the office for value for money have only staff and only in post whereas the nao have share her concern about whether it will be able to deliver value for money what additional step would she like to see take to reassure the committee that this body can offer value for money it be important that we know what the treasury be expect from this body be sure that the hon gentleman who be at our session will agree that the chair be straightforward with the committee about the limitation of body of this nature which be time limited and whose few staff be not very senior be not in any way denigrate the staff who no doubt be work hard but we need to be clear about what we be get from the headline of the office for value for money an organisation that be small and lean and about what it add to the work of other body list only few such body not all of those that be in place across whitehall thank the hon lady for her skilful and professional chairing of the select committee think all committee member be strain to find the substantive additionality of this body be not sure that we totally convince ourselves of what that be very much welcome the fact that the office for value for money be time limit unit within the treasury also welcome the fact that the office for value for money intend study in specific high risk area of cross departmental spending the role of chief secretary to the treasury be not easy and be sure that the incumbent would say that it have be make far bad by all his predecessor do the hon lady agree that one area that bear scrutiny be the future of the uk health security agency at porton down in september the then chancellor suggest that it should move to harlow in additional investment be need at porton in national crisis and there remain endure uncertainty over where that investment should lie that be classic example of what this body should be capable of do which be evaluate where future investment should be in the national interest be sure that the hon lady would echo my concern that the lack of specificity around those specific area of focus create ambiguity would she welcome more clarity on what that focus would be over the last six week thank the right hon gentleman who be fellow member of the treasury committee and former chief secretary to the treasury for his question we could have whole debate about porton down and the animal health centre in weybridge where there be under investment by his government and challenge on his side but we be not here to make party political point there be area of under investment but the lack of specificity and the duplication issue be key concern as be reflect in our cross party treasury committee report there be danger that unless this new body narrow its focus soon it will not be able to deliver in time to aid the current chief secretary to the treasury in his work of ensure that departments deliver on the spending review and come up with the proposal that provide the good value for money for the taxpayer we need that clarity the government should welcome this report because it give they an opportunity to seek great clarity from this body to aid the challenge spending review process it seem that the chair of the treasury committee have come to the firm conclusion that the office for value for money be itself not value for money in carry out her investigation of this body which appear to have be set up only for very limited period she must have ask it what its term of reference be why it have be set up only for limited period and what it be intend to achieve my guess be that the answer have something to do with the ability to search just about anywhere across the spectrum for any project that cause concern do she get an answer of that sort she must surely have get some sort of answer thank the right hon gentleman very much although should stress that it be not my evaluation but the committee we be unanimous in our concern and unanimous in our desire to see taxpayer money spend well we ask question of the office for value for money chair our report reflect the area that he might consider look at especially area in which there be great risk and area of cross departmental working there have be move over the year to get more cross departmental or joint departmental bid into the spending review but that have not really get traction because we have terribly siloe culture in whitehall that be big challenge and the current government of my own party of course have the mission which aim to bring thing together the chair say that he would be look at some of that but that be quite lot to do in the timeframe available the bid and cross party working area have to be identify those departments have to co operate and the office need the resource to look at where the issue be with only staff in total there be only when we have our hearing with the chair but there be probably more now that be stiff ask it would be helpful for treasury ministers to sit down with the office for value for money and push it to come back with the exact area that it propose to look at and that will be most useful to the government to deliver value for money thank the hon lady for her statement and her answer speak as an ulster scot like many of we in this chamber it might be an exaggeration to say that every pound be prisoner but it be none the less telling of how thrifty we be ever mindful of that hope that the hon lady be aware of the issue of agency staff in the health service whose cost be some above those for an ordinary nurse pay have highlight the matter directly to the health department on several occasion in this house will the hon lady and her committee take it on board and investigate how permanent nurse job could be allocate if we want value for money saving must be worth that effort and that commitment the hon gentleman tempt to stray into the territory of the chair of the public accounts committee the hon member for north cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown this be exactly the territory that his committee examine we all know that agency staff cost more whether that be for school or for hospital and there be an issue with the pipeline of staff will stop there because it be really not matter for the treasury committee or indeed for the office for value for money as the office be short lived it would not have the opportunity to look at something like that as we hear from its chair however be sure that the chair of the public accounts committee will be listen and will take the hon gentleman point on board global combat air programme defence committee select committee statement we now come to the second select committee statement on behalf of the defence committee tanmanjeet singh dhesi will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement they should be brief question not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair not the relevant government minister front benchers may take part in questioning it be pleasure to present the defence committee third report of the parliament which illustrate just how hard the committee be work on the house behalf for the people and their parliament my sincere gratitude go to the backbench business committee for grant time for this salient significant statement on the global combat air programme the uk be world leader in combat air we have develop and build some of the most iconic fighter jet aircraft in history from the spitfire and the meteor to the tornado and the typhoon the global combat air programme offer the opportunity to build on that history as we look to the royal air force of the future gcap an international collaboration with japan and italy that aim to deliver next generation fighter aircraft by will be one of the uk most significant defence programme of the come year the new aircraft know as tempest will be crucial to counter the threat pose by our adversary in an increasingly volatile world gcap promise much national sovereignty in combat air strengthen relationship with key ally and boost to our defence industrial capacity however deliver on that promise will not be easy the committee report seek to make constructive recommendation that we believe will maximise gcap chance of meet its ambitious target on time and on budget before come to the detail of our finding would like to provide some context about our inquiry which be begin by our predecessor committee and interrupt by the general election give the importance of the topic we feel that it be incumbent on we to complete that important work and bring our finding to the house place on the record the committee appreciation of the work undertake by our predecessor also thank the committee staff especially lucy petrie who manage the inquiry through to completion and our specialist adviser douglas barrie express my gratitude to my fellow committee member many of whom be present in the chamber who approach the report in the collaborative cross party manner for which select committees be rightly renowned turn to the report conclusion it be no surprise that programme as ambitious as gcap will take up significant share of the defence budget in the come year the ministry of defence have already spend billion on the programme and have allocate furth billion over the come decade our report call for transparency about cost as gcap progress so that our committee and other in the house can hold the ministry of defence to account the need for robust scrutiny of gcap be underline by the difficulty face previous multilateral defence programme which have all too often see cost spiral and delay pile up of particular relevance be the uk experience on the eurofighter typhoon where the committee hear of the difficulty cause by lack of empowerment in the programme delivery organisation we make it clear in our report that those fundamental error can not be repeat on gcap if gcap be to succeed it must not only learn from the mistake of the past but anticipate the opportunity and challenge of the future our report warn that it will need to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to emerge technology include artificial intelligence and the development of uncrewed aircraft the committee welcome the uk partnership with japan and italy both our partner have much to offer italy and the uk have share history in combat air have work together on tornado and typhoon for japan involvement in gcap be significant step both politically and militarily we applaud japan progress in open up export for gcap which we believe will be critical to its success there have be speculation that further partner may join the programme our report be clear that the potential benefit of expand gcap must be balance carefully against the risk and that meet the target date must remain paramount our report also highlight how as with all defence programme gcap success will ultimately come down to its workforce recruitment and retention will be major challenge for programme of this scale the defence industry face fierce competition from other sector for skilled worker our report emphasise the importance of ensure that the exist typhoon workforce be transition to gcap as well as attract new talent into the sector conclude with reflection on the committee first visit to scotland last week at raf lossiemouth we be privileged to have the opportunity to meet the royal air force personnel who protect our sky our visit be welcome reminder that for all the advanced capability promise by gcap the uk security ultimately rest in the hand of the brave servicemen and woman who put their life on the line to defend we on behalf of the committee pay tribute to their dedication and professionalism they have our sincere gratitude commend the report to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the chair for his excellent report and his vigorous statement remind the house about the great history of the uk in combat air the opposition strongly support gcap because we want that great tradition to continue well into the future however gcap be not just about the tempest platform it be mean to be system of system offer technological advance to the raf in area such as ai and autonomy give how important that be and how the committee report focus on transparency do he agree that we need financial transparency to ensure adequate funding both for the platform that we call tempest and for those associate technology because they could bring enhancement to the lethality of the raf well before welcome the word of the shadow defence secretary and thank his shadow minister the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois for all his work as part of the defence committee in the previous parliament the shadow defence secretary be right that the ministry of defence must balance funding pressure in the near and long term but transparency from the government about the cost of gcap be crucial because parliament and the public rightly expect value for money as the chair of the treasury committee my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier so eloquently highlight congratulate my hon friend on an excellent statement he will know that the committee of which be part in the previous parliament be able to visit japan and italy where we see for ourselves the tremendous enthusiasm for the project and how they want to work very closely with we at the end of the statement my hon friend rightly touch on the importance of the workforce but this project be also crucial to the future defence industrial base be it not thank my hon friend for his work on the previous defence committee and to bring the report to fruition he be absolutely right this project be crucial for our partner in japan and italy and for our own defence industrial base if we do not commit wholeheartedly to gcap it will be to our detriment as nation tornado typhoon and tempest have sort of ring to it understand why we be use the term gcap but its presentation leave lot to be desire one reason be that it be so much more than just the tempest airframe autonomous aircraft will fly in conjunction with it how confident be the select committee chair that all this can be do in fast move landscape and in just year programme thank the former chair of the intelligence and security committee for his question be not well enough verse in acronym to be able to offer something well than tempest tornado or typhoon see the minister my right hon friend the member for liverpool garston maria eagle be in her place perhaps she can think of well acronym than gcap it be incredibly important that the programme be meet and that we work with our partner the committee have highlight the need to meet the very ambitious programme by which will take substantial effort welcome my hon friend statement as the shadow defence secretary make clear gcap be system of system but like every programme it require pipeline training solution our report highlight the need for jet training solution now that production for the hawk aircraft series have be shutter after aircraft be produce and export to country that be grave mistake as our gcap partner be look for gcap trainer in the us and we have nothing to offer they our defence and aerospace industry can not survive on elite technology alone do my hon friend agree that we need to look at jet trainer as an essential part of the training system offer as part of gcap for its pilot our industry and economic growth thank my hon friend for his work on the committee he have certainly hit the ground run fully agree with his view on training the committee report find that training for the hawk aircraft have be an absolute blunder and huge miss opportunity we must ensure that we do not miss such opportunity in future as do so would be to our national detriment thank the chair and the committee for their industry and for this excellent report he highlight the size of the gcap programme and the need for such programme to show great flexibility do he intend for the committee to look during this parliament at the agile procurement of the sort that we be see in ukraine and to make recommendation to the government on that yes we have already be look into that and the committee have hold evidence session on ukraine many of we be impress by the agility be display in ukraine we hope that many of those lesson will be learn by the uk government thank my hon friend for his statement there have be some suggestion that saudi arabia and other global partner might want to join the programme what do the committee think of that the exist partnership with japan and italy be strong one but we must recognise that further partner could benefit the programme our report warn that include any additional partner will require careful consideration and it must not jeopardise the target date which be paramount do the hon gentleman agree that with our italian and japanese partner commit to multi year funding plan for gcap to give confidence to industry the uk should show similar commitment thank the hon member for his excellent question and for his hard work on the committee long may it continue wholeheartedly agree and hope that minister be listen intently because multi year funding settlement can offer we that extra stability to provide lot more in short space of time congratulate my hon friend and the whole committee on fantastic report could he expand little on the export potential of tempest and how he think the government might be able to secure that secondly be there an opportunity through informal collaboration with the other consortium pursue sixth generation fighter for general lesson to be learn between the three programme all of which involve our ally we should always be open to collaboration hope that the ministry of defence be look into that on my hon friend first question highlight export in my statement and commend japan the real potential for we be not merely to deliver on these next generation jet but to export because they contribute so much to the exchequer for the provision of public service in our country thank the chair of the defence committee for his statement declare an interest as member of the armed force parliamentary scheme in march the raf publish its autonomous collaborative platform strategy be the chair content with the assurance that there be sufficient flexibility build into gcap to allow it to operate alongside range of uncrewed solution thank the hon gentleman for his question the committee have look at autonomous aircraft we hope we will be able to realise the full benefit although only time will tell just how much of benefit we realise commend the chair and the defence committee for turn their scrutinise eye to the global combat air programme the chair talk about the benefit and risk of new partner and explain that we need to weigh the benefit against the risk in previous multilateral fighter jet programme there have be an overestimation of just how much of the product could be export last november reuters say that saudi arabia could be potential fourth partner on the programme could the chair expand on some of the benefit and risk of add saudi arabia to the programme as it relate to export the hon gentleman be member of the intelligence and security committee and indeed former defence spokesman for the liberal democrats have extra partner on board can be very beneficial as it can share the cost burden and enhance our export possibility however as the committee rightly note have additional partner will require careful consideration under no circumstance should we allow that to jeopardise the target date because that could have serious cost implication for the exchequer thank the chair of the defence committee for his statement today in the statement he refer to the demand for skilled worker on friday have the opportunity to meet unite and gmb in relation to the airspace sector in northern ireland where the chair will be aware skilled workforce already exist what discussion be be hold with this sector in northern ireland to transfer the global combat air programme skill through both small and large operation and contract as always the hon gentleman ask an excellent question have robust defence industrial base be vital as be have skilled workforce as mention our report call for holistic approach to recruitment and retention the committee have have various meeting with union representative and we feel it be very important to retain our exist typhoon workforce wherever that may be in the uk be sure my right hon friend the minister will have hear the hon gentleman

hon lady for give advance notice of her point of order she will appreciate that that be not matter for the chair but she have put point on the record and those on the front bench will have hear it on

which have do an amazing amount for sport in aberdeen wonder whether the house and you madam deputy speaker would join in send condolence to denis law family and friend on his sad passing be grateful to the hon lady for her point of order that be not matter for the chair but she have most definitely put her remark on the record on point of order madam deputy speaker today the secretary of state for northern ireland take the decision not to deploy the stormont brake despite it be support by every unionist member in the northern ireland assembly this chamber be the only place where the secretary of state can be challenge and directly question by elect representative however rather than make statement to this house he decide to give it to the medium can you advise on the option available to get the secretary of state to make statement on his decision in this place where he can be question be grateful to the hon gentleman for give notice of his point of order have have no indication that the secretary of state intend to come to the house to make statement but be sure that the table office will be able to advise the hon gentleman on how to pursue the matter far obesity food and diet beg to move that this house have consider the impact of food and diet on obesity thank the backbench business committee for allocate parliamentary time to this crucial issue we be actually go to have this debate before christmas but we decide that before christmas be not good time to discuss obesity we be then go to have it last week but it be postpone be really grateful to colleague across the house for support the debate our country have an obesity crisis that be threaten the health and wellbeing of the whole nation it be cross party issue since rate of obesity have double two third of all adult in the uk be carry excess weight and quarter of adult be classify as obese the figure be even more worrying in child of child age four when they enter school be obese that figure rise to one in four in year one problem with obesity be that as many of we know once someone become overweight it be difficult to shift that be why the most important age group to concentrate on be young people obesity be now the single most important modifiable risk factor for the prevention of disease and will briefly go through its effect as doctor can not resist around million people in this country have type diabete which be five time more likely in obesity type diabete almost double person mortality rate with people with diabete die early every year ischaemic heart disease the lead cause of death in the uk be much more common in obesity as be hypertension and osteoarthritis which cause joint pain and reduce mobility something that lot of people do not know be that cancer be directly attributable to obesity it be actually also the second commonest cause of cancer as gp there be other thing see quite regularly such as reflux varicose vein infertility and even thrombosis all of which diminish quality of life the commonest cause of liver disease be now obesity will not go into the cost too much but as we can imagine obesity cost the country an absolute fortune on average four extra sick day year and take into account the cost to the nhs and so on an estimate billion year or of gdp the cost to the nhs be billion year what be the cause of obesity from the evidence it be clear that the main cause of obesity be diet it be what we eat the food system in this country be fundamentally break welcome the statement from the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my right hon friend the member for streatham and croydon north steve reed about sustainable food production nutritious food grow while restore nature and farm with good food production at its core reward properly there be complicated relationship in food production whereby farm mostly exist on government subsidy with very small profit margin and then the supermarket make profit out of what they sell we need to look into that complicated relationship one problem be that unhealthy and ultra process food upfs that be high in fat salt and sugar be often the easy cheap and most convenient crucially they make the most profit for the food industry the other problem with these type of food be that they be addictive salty fatty food be addictive another problem reveal by the food foundation be that healthy food calorie for calorie be twice as expensive as less healthy food so there be lot of issue there to unpick inequality and deprivation be very very strong cause of obesity with less well off people be twice as likely to be overweight therefore one strategy have to be to increase the living wage reduce child poverty improve health and social service and invest in education all of which the government be do on pregnancy obesity actually begin in the womb it do not even begin when we be bear in one fascinating experiment one group of pregnant woman be feed lot of carrot and another group do not have any carrot the child of the woman who eat carrot love carrot so memory be make in utero it be therefore really important that pregnant woman have very healthy diet as this be risk factor for obesity in young people another be formula feed breastfeed protect against obesity but formula feed do not follow on feed hungry baby feed be just normal milk pack full of calorie so they tend to increase obesity that be perhaps something we need to discuss too be the chair of the eat disorder all party parliamentary group to make any progress we have to understand that eat disorder be highly stigmatise many people with obesity also have an eat disorder to make real progress be not the first thing to take the stigma away from obesity and get to the people who really want to improve their life absolutely agree with that we must treat people in fair and compassionate way we must point that out to they as medical professional and help they to get well agree with the hon lady about stigma on obesity strategy since we have have separate policy to tackle obesity yet it have double clearly we be do something wrong have look at the evidence it be clear that voluntary target do not work voluntary target for the food industry and rely on individual agency give we choice in what we eat can not reduce obesity the food industry of course have vested interest in make money while education and exercise be really good there be not much evidence to suggest that they reduce obesity it be all about food there have be lot of research nesta the obesity health alliance and the house of lords food diet and obesity committee have do multiple report on obesity and it be clear that we can halve it all we need to do be reduce everyone calorie intake by calorie day that be the difference between mcdonald large fry and standard fry other fry be available so it be not massive thing but we all have to do it as always with public health small drop in what we take can have massive effect on the population do my hon friend agree that it be important when there be such strong correlation between child poverty and child obesity that we tackle not only the food system lead to poor health outcome but the price of food we must see those two challenge in lockstep and work to address both the quality of food and the cost absolutely one of the main pitfall we must avoid be that there be no point in make cheap food more expensive that will make people poor we need to be much more creative than that thank my hon friend for secure the debate and for allow to intervene commend the government new policy of free breakfast club for all primary school child but do he agree that we should not miss the opportunity to ensure that that meal be wholesome and nutritious so that all our kid can get off to the good possible start yes could not agree more as say in the debate on education we should be careful about the food industry sponsor school breakfast as point out there be no such thing as free breakfast company often make unhealthy and addictive food and get young people addict to it so we must be cautious want recipe to solve this crisis and what be suggest come from evidence from nesta and the house of lords select committee it should be mandatory that all store report on the food healthiness of their sale we need fully independent food standards agency we should have ban on advertising junk food as have already be propose and there should be watershed for child that be incredibly important as be plan in scotland and wales there should be ban on price promotion particularly for unhealthy food ultra process food and takeaway we also need to put lot more resource into breastfeed and diet in pregnancy remember the carrot and we must regulate formula feed one measure which have work with the drink industry in reduce sugar be reformulation tax on food that be high in sugar and salt supermarket and food company would reformulate their food to avoid the tax thereby make they healthy my hon friend the member for slough mr dhesi mention breakfast club there be lot of evidence that free school meal and breakfast club reduce obesity where free school meal have be introduce in london childhood obesity have be reduce by that be because the food be healthy and healthy hot meal be really important rather than high calorie snack which be what lot of pack lunch consist of if we can not have free school meal because of financial problem we should have auto enrolment so that child who should be on free school meal actually get enrol that would benefit school too we must have mandatory front of packet labelling have never meet parent who do not want to buy healthy food for their child the trouble be that they pick up packet of cereal and it say high in iron and fill with vitamin and think it must be healthy nothing could be far from the truth so we must have accurate labelling healthy school food should be source locally in stroud have be work closely with local primary school to encourage they to eat fresh locally grow highly nutritious food think the government target be to procure at least of food in school from local source then there be the famous hospital food be recently in hospital with relative and can tell the house that hospital food be not healthy we have white bread sandwich and some crisp that be our healthy snack we must introduce healthy food in hospital takeaway be another big barrier to healthy eating there be massive explosion in their use during the covid pandemic and we need to include they in any regulation as have say in scotland and wales ban on takeaway price promotion have be propose on average those in deprive area order more takeaway than those in non deprive area we certainly must not let takeaway outlet open near school that be planning must would also caution against the treatment of the obesity crisis with injection of drug such as ozempic which could well turn out to be dangerous accord to today press there be clear evidence of that apparently people across the united kingdom who take ozempic experience poor health as result it be not for everyone and the soon that people know that the well the hon gentleman intervention remind of the gp take over from an old chap very wise who say always be few year out of date simon because we never know what these new drug be go to cause think that be good advice not that be suggest that doctor be out of date of course be we propose the creation of nanny state that be the great fear of many people when they be confront by control of this kind but let we look at what happen with the ban on smoke inside pub people particularly in ireland but also in england be say this be crazy it be never go to work but it work fantastically well we need to be aware of the vested interest of food company and we need to take radical step thank my gloucestershire neighbour for give way he mention the nanny state as liberal believe in freedom but there be two side to it freedom from and freedom to should not freedom from some of those represent the big powerful vested interest in the food company who be not interested in our health be at the centre of this debate entirely agree think that this parliament could do to obesity what the government who be in power between and do to smoking we could drastically reduce it for the sake of our child and our old adult urge everyone to accept that we need to act now and we need to act radically congratulate the hon member for stroud dr opher on secure this important debate there be lot in his speech with which agree and lot with which disagree do not want to explore the subject of childhood obesity although think that many of his point about it be quite important want to focus on adult obesity there be great many new member in the chamber who do not know who be so they will not have see when be enormously fat before be down to the size be now have struggle with my weight throughout my life but have control it for several year back in manage to lose stone through smoking cigarette provide way for to diet and keep the weight off give up smoking in may we do not need to have debate about smoking and what it do to people and put on considerable amount of weight there be always lot of stigma surround weight everything about weight be stigmatise whether we be too thin or too fat or dieting and by the way everyone have advice for we when we be diet it do not matter what be work they will say what you need to do be this will come on to the weight loss regime that be on at the moment but they will say for instance you should be give up drinking because you will lose your social life well go to the small yorkshire village where live and have several pint over few hour mean have lot of empty calorie thousand of they so that be exactly what someone who be try to lose weight should do but people always give that advice the hon member for strangford jim shannon mention incidence but what that statistic do not say about the damage that the jabs as we call they can do be that half million people be have they we be in danger of get into the same argument that some of the nutter who talk about the covid jab have get themselves into that it be deadly and we be poison everyone and this that and the other it be administer to million of people and drug will always have side effect that be something we must remember the contraceptive pill use by million of people have side effect drug do have side effect but that be not reason to rule they out want to expand on this stigma about the jabs as say at the outset be focus today on adult obesity and as also say the hon member for stroud make some important point about childhood obesity and the link with food but much of what he say be base on the idea that people have three meal day and they be eat too much that have not be my experience many member especially new member will learn how exhausting this job become at some point in their career they will ask themselves how do carry on and they will turn to sugar to get they through the rest of the day see plenty of member nod they will have chocolate bar because that be the boost we need and that be where we end up have do that have what some might describe as an addictive personality when cut something out replace it with something else when cut out cigarette replace they with food it have be difficult journey try to eat healthily and try to do thing with my weight but reach point at which could not do it in the middle of september start take wegovy and since then have lose over stone have go from body mass index of to one of although there be still couple of stone that want to lose but and this be the big have to work with it these be not miracle drug the big mistake that the press make in this regard be refer to fat dissolve drug there be no such thing as fat dissolve drug that be blatant nonsense for this drug take away the craving it have enable to do the intermittent fasting have protein base meal at pm banana at pm and small meal in the evening with tiny bit of carbohydrate and do not eat after pm that be how have drop the weight cut out drink for the first eight week although do drink over christmas and cut out sugar for week want to build on something that the hon member for stroud say about sugar be drug oh boy yes it be drug feel horrific for the first three week of cut out sugar have have little bit of sugar over christmas think it be christmas you have to manage the psychology of this well the first time have one mince pie boy do know about it have to have some grape later to try to bring about the slow sugar release there be no doubt that high sugar and salt level be addictive but have personality that make do that very interesting point be make on radio last week emma barnett be interview someone about this drug miss who it be she say but be there the question of morality when people use drug to reduce their weight this be where think there be fundamental misunderstanding of obesity in adult and the issue of weight what be now emerge be link thread that run through several aspect of someone health not least relate to fatigue mental health or personality and what be be discover be that the drug have positive effect in many of those area we need to remove the stigma from talk about be on drug such as ozempic wegovy and mounjaro they be certainly help and know of many friend and many colleague in the house who be use they because they do take away that craving however it still come down to willpower stand before members today and feel horrific have consume less than calorie so far today and it be now pm do not feel great but it be work be engage in process in which be try to lose the weight in the first six month and in the next six month will go back to the normal number of calorie do the exercise and build up my fitness this be programme and regime and it be work for however must make the point that if people be not willing to work with these drug they will not have the effect there must be brake in their promotion because people who think they can just inject themselves at home and lose weight be wrong it be so easy to cheat why do not feel too great at the moment there be not enough calorie in what would give boost straight away some chocolate or anything like that when cut out sugar cut out crisp cake biscuit and various other thing include alcohol for while be not go teetotal for the rest of my life and be not cut out sugar for the rest of my life people have to find balance but it be easy to cheat and they have to want to lose weight there be no correlation here but think there be an interesting piece of work to be do will explain why be say this in moment on the fact that there have be huge reduction in smoking in the century and big rise in obesity certainly use cigarette to help keep my weight down and know that many other people do too if someone feel hungry they can have cigarette be delighted that give up smoking it take most of my life to do so smoke for most of my adult life and have drink lot for most of my adult life be year old and be in my twenty in the there be culture in the that carry on through why do we push forward with get people off smoking we do it because of the absolutely obvious and well prove health consequence of smoking such as thrombosis heart attack and high blood pressure since have lose stone my blood pressure have come down by millibar it be now textbook blood pressure the hon member for stroud be absolutely right have pain in my joint and foot and would sweat but would not give in to it when my foot hurt would not give in to it because think if give in to it just go to put on even more weight would not stop because have always be fairly active and have keep go make these point because recently hear report that if weight loss jabs be put out on nhs prescription it would bankrupt the nhs think that be absolute nonsense because we know just how preventive this sort of action be that be why we get people to give up smoking we make lot of tax from the sale of cigarette but it cost the nhs billion of pound we know that lot of the condition that cigarette cause be equally cause by obesity along with many other thing again the use of weight loss jab could prevent the nhs from spend much more money later on diabetes care orthopaedic care and mental health care we know that people find be inactive depressing quite frankly and that their mental health take decline when they become inactive we have to separate the issue of childhood obesity and adult obesity which be two very different thing for those of we who end up starve of sleep and those who end up never know when they will have proper meal or where they will get it from it be easy to fall into the trap have often find that people who have never have problem with their weight be full of all the answer for those who do struggle with their weight who may well tell other what they be do and then be tell no what you want to be do be this it be nonsense the use of weight loss jabs offer the nhs real advantage but we have to reduce the stigma and it be right that we ask whether it be moral to use drug to reduce people wight lot of people do not have choice about their weight and they be now discover that small dose of hormonal drug help they to control their desire to eat the long term effect of obesity on the country health and on the pressure on the nhs will be reduce when become stone light than be back in september there be no doubt that my health situation will have far well outlook than it do and that be the conversation we should be have when it come to adult there have be enough comment on whether somebody be stick thin or really fat and enough advice about what people should do to lose weight we now have some answer that will actually make difference and we have to say these be the right thing to do as we do with so many other drug that help people get through their life we do not comment on people use nicotine patch or nicotine gum yet we do talk about people who be try to do thing to help they lose weight rise order as member can see from the annunciator the debate on financial education have be postpone so the current debate can go on until pm thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for secure this debate some of five year old child start school in bolton be classify as overweight or obese and the figure rise to by the time they leave primary school across the country child in the poor area be twice as likely to be live with obesity as those in the rich area when we walk around our constituency we can see why we all know that the poor part of the area we represent be invariably overwhelmed with fast food outlet sell cheap junk food with minimal nutritional value they be plaster with advert for food that harm people health they be often devoid of safe green space for exercise and of route to travel safely to work that be the impact of the place where people live when we add the price and convenience of unhealthy food and the relentless and predatory marketing that pressure people into eat more junk food we can see why the uk now have the third high obesity rate in europe the burden of this preventable illness be fall on our poor citizen it can not continue as the minister will be aware it be in the poor community that we see the bad case of heart attack stroke type diabete fatty liver disease and other preventable disease there will always be those who claim that people just need to make well choice would ask they be our poor citizen make choice that be twice as bad be they less informed do they care less about their child health of course not they face structural barrier that rich people do not we must break down the barrier many of the intervention recommend in the house of lords report could make real difference include improve baby food increase access to healthy start voucher and building on the success of the soft drink industry levy all those intervention be worth make but will talk specifically about marketing it be very welcome that the government have commit to deliver regulation on tv and online advertising in october this year and to end the sale of high caffeine energy drink to child note that the latter policy be one of the most popular idea in our manifesto because people be worried about what their child be eat and drink and they want the government to do something about it both policy should have come into effect under the last government but unfortunately they do not urge ministers not to make the mistake of listen to the same lobbying that take place last time and prevent the regulation from come in the regulation on tv and online advertising be modest and will not come into effect until the end of this year that be not good enough we must go far and fast to deliver the change that we need to really turn the tide the house of lords food diet and obesity committee recommend go far and end the advertising of food high in fat salt and sugar on all format by the end of this parliament there be clear blueprint for this tobacco advertising on tv be end in the but the blair government realise that more action be need and introduce the tobacco advertising and promotion act that legislation could almost be copy verbatim to protect child from predatory advertising or product that harm their health particular focus should be on outdoor advertising four out of five billboard advert in this country be in the poor area and they be overwhelmingly for unhealthy product it be overtly prey on our citizen and we have the power to stop it eleven metro mayors include my own mayor in greater manchester andy burnham have step up to end such advert on the outdoor space that they control but they can only do so much we need the government to extend the regulation to cover privately hold outdoor advertising to ensure that child in my constituency and across the country be protect from these advert obesity and poor diet constitute the lead preventable health crisis of our time one that be drive horrific and preventable harm to people health and be drive inequality in health outcome our poor citizen be pay the price for these harmful food with their health the house of lords inquiry echo the recommendation of many other expert include the henry dimbleby national food strategy multiple lead think tank such as the health foundation and the institute for public policy research and the lead health charity and medical royal college represent by the obesity health alliance all the expert agree on the action that need to be take the minister have blueprint for what need to be do implore he to implement it congratulate the hon member for stroud dr opher on secure this debate thank he for raise interesting aspect of which be not aware such as the cancer also thank the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke for share his personal journey with we in this chamber it be worthwhile contribution to this debate in nearly of child in year in west berkshire be classify as overweight an increase of on the year before this be not an isolated trend obesity rate among child and adult be rise across the country the doubling of obesity rate in the uk over the past year have be drive by multiple factor of which change in diet be one of the most significant in that time the uk food environment have also undergo dramatic shift today of all food outlet be fast food establishment offer meal that be high in sugar and fat but more affordable than healthy alternative their affordability make they increasingly attractive particularly to those who be under financial pressure with the rise cost of living especially with energy bill many household be leave with less disposable income and food budget be one of the first area in which people try to cut cost over the past three year the price of healthy food have increase by per kilocalorie compare with just for less healthy option the impact of these change diet be have severe consequence on people health and be place immense pressure on the nhs obesity increase the risk of develop various disease include certain cancer such as colon cancer it raise by more than two and half time the likelihood of high blood pressure which greatly increase the risk of heart disease accord to frontier economics obesity cost the nhs billion every year that be simply unacceptable the uk should be among the healthy country in the world we have rich tradition of grassroots sport high quality food production and world lead medical research yet our statistic tell different story the uk currently have the third high rate of overweight or obese individual in europe the government must take decisive action to address this grow crisis the liberal democrats have call for reversal of the conservatives cut to the public health grant that enable local authority to deliver the essential preventive service and community programme that combat obesity and promote healthy diet we also urge the government to expand the national food strategy not only to address food security but to tackle rise food price end food poverty and improve public health and nutrition it be vital that we halt this alarming trend of rise obesity people deserve the opportunity to live healthy long life reduce obesity will also have transformative impact on the nhs ease the immense pressure that it be face implore the government to take bold action and urgent step to ensure that healthy food option be more accessible and to foster culture of healthy activity across our nation congratulate my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher on secure this hugely important debate when be write my maiden speech back in july do some research into my predecessor as one do it be fascinating to see that it have be nearly year since the voter of chelsea elect non conservative mp he be mr emslie john horniman lately of the horniman museum his father frederick horniman be an mp under queen victoria be think that mr horniman senior would find lot of similarity between his time as an mp during the victorian era and the job today the main building be largely the same although it be possibly even cold in those day some of the rule and procedure be the same and he would probably even find some familiar face among colleague in both houses thankfully one of the big difference between mr horniman senior time and today would be the food that be not just because the victorians would not be enjoy the famous parliamentary jerk chicken but because when it come to the food that people eat in victorian time the story be one of adulteration and contamination describe the victorian history of adulteration and contamination of food the us professor of history anthony wohl say the list of poisonous additive read like the stock list of some mad and malevolent chemist if we have enjoy glass of beer here with gladstone or disraeli we might also have be drink strychnine and hallucinogen with wine we could have imbibe sulphate of copper the mustard with our lunch would probably have come with add lead chromate our gloucester cheese afterwards might well have owe its rosy hue to red lead it be no wonder that indigestion cure in victorian time be so popular thank goodness thing be so different today thank goodness we have food standard thank goodness we do not allow people to eat thing that make they so ill except that we do day in day out food manufacturer add substance to food that on the scale at which they be eat today quite legally damage people health supermarket promote they and sell they as result obesity type diabete and the many other medical problem to which my hon friend the member for stroud refer have become huge issue in this day and age be grateful to the hon gentleman order when the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman take an intervention he must be seat the hon gentleman be make thought provoke observation but do he acknowledge that in time past the proportion of income that any individual from whichever class spend on food be considerably high than it be today if we be to get to the heart of the matter we have to address the wide challenge of our society expectation of how much money we should spend on food do he not agree that we be addicted to cheap food the right hon member make an excellent point that will come to in moment the additive that cause so much harm today have simple name sugar salt and fat in moderation all of those be fine but the problem be that they be be shove into our food willy nilly in an effort to preserve it and on the right hon member point to make it cheap alongside make it more addictive by design as result we have what the house of lords food diet and obesity committee report rightly describe as public health emergency we now have one of the high rate of obesity among high income nation only tobacco shorten british live more than poor diet the hon gentleman be make some very important point would add that adult obesity be not necessarily down to the kind of food that he have outline when people be tired or feel depressed just the satiation of eat even if it be healthy and they be eat more than they should have the same effect use to have cigarette which do that and sometimes people drink to do it but it could also be do with healthy food it be about quantity that can not always be control and there be big link totally agree with what the hon gentleman be say about these addictive substance but they be not the only part of the puzzle be grateful for the right hon gentleman comment be not attempt to put together the whole puzzle but additive be an extremely important part of the puzzle we do ourselves disservice if we pretend that sugar salt and fat eat in the quantity they be today and the ready food that can be buy so cheaply be not poisonous and not huge problem that we need to address be not wild about the term obese because of the negative pejorative connotation that can make people feel awful about themselves as have be say but it be the good term we have at the moment over fifth of child in this obese the figure be even high in my constituency which contain some of the country rich people as well as many resident live in poverty in the london borough of kensington and chelsea of reception pupil age four to five be obese in the borough of hammersmith and fulham of reception pupil be classify as obese this be problem everywhere not just in the poor part of the country it be therefore hugely good news that the government have identify shift from ill health to prevention as one of the three major objective of their health mission it be even well news that cross government national food strategy be be develop what would like to see in that national food strategy what should be do would like we to start by realise that it be time to stop place excessive emphasis on individual responsibility that may be hard to swallow for some people but the lords report make it clear that year of policy that rely solely on personal choice rather than tackle the underlie driver of unhealthy diet have fail to shift the dial sadly under successive government these policy have contribute to widen health inequality as my hon friend the member for bolton south and walkden yasmin qureshi note the lords report rightly praise the last government sugar tax on soft drink officially call the soft drink industry levy it be significant public health success people be consume less sugar while obesity remain an overall problem it have fall to an extent particularly among girl age and in the most deprive area few child be have to go to hospital to have their decay tooth pull out that bring to the lack of dentist after year of conservative government but will not go there now the sugar tax have save million possibly billion of pound in healthcare cost as well as lot of misery it be pretty good example to follow so support the call by my hon friend the member for stroud for the levy to be extend to more food product and for similar action to be take on salt and fat be glad that the government be deliver on their manifesto pledge to give child the good and healthiest start in life by ban the targeting of junk food at child just as advertising restriction contribute to decline in the number of smoker hope that restrict the advertising of unhealthy food will contribute to decline in childhood obesity also agree that label food well to distinguish between healthy and less healthy product be essential it already work as allergy sufferer be benefit from natasha law which require food business to fully label their ingredient however target unhealthy food be not enough even unhealthy food be well than no food for those who can not afford healthy ingredient for those who can not find healthy ingredient or for those who do not know how to cook they be not argue that we should make crap food so expensive that people be force to go elsewhere to buy even more expensive alternative as the hon member for newbury mr dillon say it be of fundamental importance that healthy food should be affordable to everyone and widely available wherever they live at the moment it be far from either it be no good badger people to eat five piece of fruit and veg day if they can not afford to do so or if it be not available locally that be just patronising be surprised that no one have mention the rise of food bank do my hon friend share my view that although well mean people give produce to food bank it be often tin product or ready meal that people need to cook at home which may be an inadvertent driver of this issue that be very good point the poverty in this country now and the cost of energy be cause people in my constituency to go to food bank and ask for food that they do not have to cook we be offer people food that might not always be of the good quality and food bank tell that lot of healthy fresh fruit and veg go to waste because people be either worried about the cost of energy or simply do not know how to cook these be addressable problem these be thing that we can do something about if we want to do so strongly back the house of lords report recommendation that the revenue from salt and sugar reformulation tax should be use to make healthy food cheap particularly for those on low income would like some of the revenue to go to organisation such as alexandra rose charity operate in my constituency it make healthy food affordable and accessible to family on low income by hand out voucher so that pregnant woman and the family of child under five can buy fresh fruit and veg at local market or independent shop in the heart of fulham family and child have enjoy worth of fresh fruit and veg from our wonderful north end road market which have operate since late victorian time alexandra rose tell that six month after start the project of child be meet their five day target compare with just when it begin as the government develop their food strategy encourage they to consider support such charity to extend their work through national action another issue be the accessibility of food and do not think this point be address enough many part of this country be healthy food desert in his annual report professor sir chris whitty the chief medical officer say that family in inner city area be less likely to have access to healthy affordable food option and as result they will have short and unhealthier life we have to ensure that good food be available at an affordable price hope the food strategy will look at that as well as at teach basic cookery in school that be another important point change will take time but it can be do it just need the political will hope we will reach position where if mr horniman could come back to see we he would be delighted after all we must remember that he take immense pride in the tea his family produce it be one of the very few to be declare free of chemical and safe to drink in the let we hope we can say the same about our food in the future be grateful to the hon member for stroud dr opher for secure this debate on the important subject of the impact of food and diet on obesity over the past year as have be note obesity have be the subject of over food relate health policy in england yet while successive government have recognise the immense challenge of obesity and have seek to tackle it through various strategy scheme and mandate obesity rate have remain excessively high although over the past five year we have see adult obesity rate stabilise and the number of child who be overweight or obese fall to the low level since there be so much more work to do to address this issue which be have an alarming impact on people health in the uk today more than one in cancer case be link to excess weight and obesity be predict to overtake smoking as the lead preventable cause of cancer in woman by it be estimate that by the cost of treat type diabete will exceed that of treat all cancer today alongside this health crisis come phenomenal financial cost the nhs currently spend billion year on obesity relate illness indeed the independent national food strategy cite an even large figure of billion with diabete care alone already account for nearly of the nhs budget we must act now to address this issue we do not have another year to get this right nor can we afford another policy we can not just look for easy win on this subject rather we should look for meaningful transformative policy shift and not fall foul of previous mistake in the past approach by government have not always be join up in understand the whole food cycle from supplier to shop shelf political and economic decision have contribute to that if we be serious about reform the food system the government will have to implement strategy that engage producer of all size from small business to large corporation across the supply chain to give consumer choice when they make their weekly shop although it may seem in some respect that we now have access to more food option and choice than ever before for many people those choice be often limit by cost too often the cost of healthy option be increase while the cost of ultra process food decrease in the uk the majority of our diet be now make up of ultra process food grow evidence link upf and adverse health outcome so it be vital that more research be do to ensure we be make informed policy decision we need to ensure that it be not just the large food manufacturer that be dominate the discussion and lead the market and that we be create opportunity and space for small innovative food producer to contribute to the debate and help to provide solution to some of the challenge we face part of the solution mean work with our farmer who already produce some of fresh healthy food to high animal welfare standard of anywhere in the world the produce of the farmer in my constituency be second to none cheshire beef and dairy product be some of the most nutritious natural and tasty on the market we need to ensure our farmer and food producer be part of the solution and that we strive to connect people to where our food come from just as we need join up approach across the supply chain we need join up approach across government the department for environment food and rural affairs and the department for health and social care can publish strong food strategy but it will need involvement from the treasury to ensure the path from farm to fork or supplier to shelf be support have talk about choice and the impact of food price for family who be try their good to make healthy choice but alongside cost limitation be the limitation on people time my husband and both work full time and as mum know from experience that after long day at work all too often the easy option be to pick up some food on the way home that be convenient but perhaps not that healthy for we and our family know there be thousand of hard work parent across chester south and eddisbury indeed the country who will know what be talk about we as legislator and supermarket as the gateway where people buy their food can take step to improve choice for consumer both financially and in relation to convenience that will help we to become healthy nation for instance supermarket could have section with ingredient next to healthy recipe shorten the time the consumer would need to be in the shop and encourage they to try new and nutritious meal we can and must do more to address this issue we must connect people with where their food come from have frank conversation about the impact of ultra process food and deliver research to ensure we have evidence to make meaningful change we need to support small business work with they as they develop innovative way to produce and market their product and ensure they have voice at the table alongside the large supplier and supermarket we need to understand the challenge that family face with the cost and time constraint of busy family life and ensure we be do all we can to help they navigate path to healthy nutritious and tasty food in conclusion hope the government will look at deliver food strategy base on cross party consultation that will address the food system from supplier to shelf because the cost of obesity for individual and for society as whole be unsustainable and be health crisis we can not ignore thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for secure this much need debate also thank the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke for share his testimony about how he lose stone in such short time tip my turban to he have my own story lose stone in two month because of what doctor tell forget the nanny state he say to in no uncertain term if you do lose weight you will be here in couple of year time go home reel from that news and do exactly what he tell to do lose the weight have fantastic body mass index and then go back for my test however let be clear people can not undo or year of damage if

manipulation and exploitation of young people and support everyone to live healthy life commend the hon member for stroud dr opher on bring forward this important debate it be refreshing that member on both side of the chamber be all agree and try to find way forward figure show that more than quarter of child age four and five in wales be measure as be overweight with one in be obese while those figure be hugely concern the factor for obesity as have be say be incredibly complex they include the impact of poverty behaviour result from technological advance and unhealthy food to name just few as hon member will know health be devolved matter in wales obesity be rightly recognise as one of the most significant public health challenge both in cardiff and here in westminster at the start of this senedd term the then cabinet secretary for health and social care eluned morgan say can give you an absolute commitment absolutely determined that this be an area that we should focus on four or five year on from that commitment campaigner be raise the alarm obesity alliance cymru have say that without urgent action to combat rate of obesity in wales our nhs will likely face additional cost of million in wales by it be therefore vital that health policy on obesity be receptive to the link between the prevalence of poverty and physical and mental wellbeing that mean resource to promote physical activity and improve health education and more time for physical education plaid cymru be proud to have secure free school meal for all primary school child in wales at the heart of the policy be the belief that each and every child should have access to hot nutritious meal especially when so many rely on their school lunch as their most substantial meal of the day to that end initiative be already in place that can achieve the high standard of food produce that we all want for our constituent where live in llanarthne it be small rural village in the middle of nowhere but it be the heart of wales the council own bremenda isaf farm have be take over to produce vegetable for the public plate as part of the bwyd sir gâr food partnership the project prove not only that we can still achieve short food supply chain which be useful for food security and resilience but that local and government lead farm to fork initiative can work successfully both to support local farming and to ensure well quality tasty food for our child and resident the bremenda isaf project could be an example to emulate across the whole uk use public land to produce public food the uk government share prosperity fund which be be cut to million in before be scrap be influential in make that initiative happen reiterate my call for any wide funding reform to consider the importance of need base funding and for all funding allocation for wales to be decide in wales research by nesta an innovation foundation argue that we can reduce obesity and improve population health by improve our food environment that mean look at the price of healthy option portion size advertising and promotion and convenience in other word holistic approach be the way forward as hon member have set out policy idea have already be develop to put that in motion new idea and initiative have challenge but for more effective decision making we desperately need different mindset under resource these initiative will inevitably mean high future spending on health now be the time to look at our local community and learn from they rise order to ensure that everybody get in be set time limit of eight minute on that note will keep it short thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for bring forward the debate slightly disagree with his suggestion that food be the only answer because think fitness play part but guess that be slightly different discussion prior to become an mp be physical training instructor in the army and have work in the fitness industry for year so have see at first hand the positive effect that good nutrition can have on people mental and physical health it be absolutely massive as the house will know be an extremely proud swindonian and absolutely love swindon it be the good place in the world though some might disagree but there be some fact and statistic that be less proud of one of they be that of child in my constituency leave primary school overweight shocking statistic they be be set up for failure later in life for example by get condition such as diabete it be something we absolutely have to address as member have mention when we dig little deep into the statistic we see that not only be those child overweight but more often than not they come from deprive area that mean it be not only health issue but an equality issue that be something our government have set out to fix and it be something we must take seriously once again be proud that we be have this debate it be important that we talk about obesity and food and be thankful that the government have take forward preventative measure for care in the community first and look forward to hear what the minister have to say on that thank my hon friend the member for stroud for bring the debate forward and hon member for take part in it commend the hon member for stroud dr opher for secure the debate and for put himself out there by call for sugar and salt reformulation tax will add that it be not just through penalty that we will tackle diet in this country it be also through incentive today want to talk about some incentive be use in east devon where represent honiton and sidmouth it be recognise long time ago that ultra process food be not only link to obesity but be contribute to malnutrition and poor dental health want to highlight the brilliant work of the charity project food which be dedicate to improve diet promote healthy lifestyle and reduce the burden of preventable disease in the community project food be link slightly to restaurant call river cottage one of the trustee stewart dodd invite to see project food in october it operate out of axminster community hospital and that be entirely fitting because the work it do be very much around public health project food be shin example of grassroots public health action through free cooking demonstration hand on session one to one support and online class it empower people to move away from ultra process food yet it find it very difficult to keep up with the grow demand for its service in devon more family than ever be turn to project food for help because of the high cost of nutritious food contrast with the relative affordability of food pack with sugar and palm oil alarmingly report by the food foundation reveal that low income household now need to spend up to of their disposable income on food if they be to meet government recommendation on what be healthy diet over of uk household experience food insecurity and as we all know million be turn to food bank as well as to ultra process food just to survive while the debate be principally about diet and food we should think about some of the co benefit of reduce sugar intake will point to dentistry few than half of the child in devon see dentist last year promote healthy eating habit could reduce the strain not only on the wide nhs and secondary care but on dentistry we know that tooth decay be the lead cause of hospital admission for child age between five and nine so this be plainly an area where work on the reformulation of food could help save money on dentistry too the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman refer early to natasha law which be about how allergen be illustrate on food packaging that be extend through the calorie labelling regulation that come into effect in those regulation have help to prevent obesity by ensure that when people go into café or restaurant they can see what it be they be eat and the calorie associate with the meal they might choose we should also recognise that this can have negative effect have constituent come to to talk about the calorie labelling regulation in and the effect they have have on her daughter who suffer from anorexia the requirement on large business to put calorie count on menu have make it extremely difficult for she to go out to eat with her daughter her daughter would take one look at the menu and simply refuse to eat anything and it lead to the family simply not go out to eat at all one way the minister might consider build on those calorie labelling regulation be by require those same restaurant and cafés to have menu with no calorie count on they so that family can dine out without the fear of stress out somebody who have an eat disorder to return to project food and how we can well support some of the community asset we have to help tackle obesity and improve diet we should be think about the use of community hospital we have spare space in community hospital at axminster and ottery saint mary from where project food operate suggest that the work be carry out by project food would be suitable for social prescribing it be definitely have positive effect on the people see who be work with that charity it have do some excellent work and suggest that its work could be scale and implement across the country with that spare capacity we could see hub for nutrition programme and other public health measure that support healthy community which would be very much in line with what the government have be talk about in response to the darzi report by address poor nutrition head on in the community we can reduce inequality improve life and alleviate the immense pressure on our health service congratulate my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher on get this important debate in the house people sometimes talk about rise level of obesity as simply consequence of individual choice they say the issue be no more complex than the fact that people be choose not to eat healthily and not to exercise regularly but if we talk to any expert academic or parent struggle to put food on the table they will say that the truth be much more complicated because rise rate of obesity be deeply tie to social and economic change over the past year obesity rate have double while people knowledge of nutrition have not decline instead expert point to the change in the food environment unhealthy food have become much cheap easy to access and more convenient while healthy option have become more expensive hard to access and less convenient the fact bear that out today fruit and vegetable cost twice as much per calorie as food high in fat and sugar to eat in line with the government recommend diet the most deprived fifth of uk household would need to spend of their disposable income on food while the rich fifth would need to spend just accord to research from the food foundation it be little wonder therefore that the most deprived fifth of household eat more than third less fruit and vegetable compare with the wealthy fifth although everyone be affect by the food environment it do not affect everyone equally it be hard for working class family to afford healthy and nutritious food that be beyond doubt that link between poverty and obesity be clearly see among child those in the most deprived fifth of the population be more than twice as likely to be live with obesity than those in the rich fifth child in knowsley which form part of my constituency have some of the high rate of obesity in the country the fantastic director of public health at knowsley council sarah mcnulty say that that be poverty and deprivation issue it do not have to be this way instead of food system that pump out unhealthy food while million struggle to put meal on the table we could have system that guarantee everyone good healthy diet put an end to the scandal of hunger and food bank that be the demand of the right to food campaign which be very proud to lead in parliament it seek first and foremost to end the injustice of food poverty but also to ensure that food be of high quality and healthy that mean everything from ensure that high street planning encourage healthy eating and build proper safety net to get people out of food bank to introduce universal free school meal and opening community kitchen we know the effect that those policy have in tackle food poverty and obesity academic study show that in the london borough that have provide free school meal for all primary school pupil the prevalence of obesity have be reduce by around in liverpool co operative such as food for thought non profit company that produce school meal be wait to go on free school meal many area in liverpool be class as food desert with healthy food in short supply and unaffordable for people who be struggle to get by after the cost of live crisis and year of grind austerity just of adult in my great city of liverpool eat five portion of fruit and vegetable every day in fans support foodbanks an organisation we set up in create the market style mobile food pantry model to tackle the issue of food desert in liverpool which have since feed thousand of family across liverpool and st helens in non stigmatise manner with fresh fruit and vegetable an absolutely fundamental part of the offering take this opportunity to place on the record my thank to all the volunteer who have create that unique model and make it such success it have make such difference to lot of community across liverpool since the rose voucher for fruit and veg project have support struggle family in liverpool to access fruit and veg almost worth of fresh fruit and veg have be buy with the voucher enable almost people to access healthy option and avoid food poverty such community lead solution which put people before profit be one way we can help those in our community who be struggle to access healthy and affordable food take this opportunity once again to thank everybody involve in those project both those fantastic scheme be stick plaster over gap wound we need systemic change implement right to food be not the art of the impossible it be in the government gift its funding could be underpin by high fat salt and sugar levy on food producer the remodelling of our food system into one that keep the population and future generation healthy be political choice for the sake of future generation hope that the government make the right choice thank the hon member for stroud dr opher for bring this matter to the house and everybody who have speak so brilliantly this debate far prove the point that the issue of diet and health be personal to so many people and it have be incredible to hear that echo across the house food be essential for life it be part of who we be part of our story and for many in this house and across the uk part of our cultural heritage however so many family across the uk can not make end meet they be literally struggle to put food on the table pay tribute to the resurgam trust community fridge base in the laganview and old warren estate in lisburn and to dee and carol who operate the st vincent de paul service at the chapel in lisburn feel almost awful say that because people in our society should not be force to use charity in this day and age food bank be not normal whenever be grow up year ago and talk about they in this way still make feel really queasy want to call out something that for be an elephant in the room just now like all thorny societal issue it will not be address and deal with in the health departments here in england and in northern ireland we have people who work some of the long hour in europe worker on minimum wage and often on zero hour contract go home at the end of the day to house that do not have big kitchen and fancy utensil they might not know how to use pasta or this that and the other and why should we dictate what food people should eat it be up to they to choose what to eat yes ideally it should be healthy but we be now in situation where we be say well if you use your money wisely you can spend and buy big job lot of pasta and bit of pasta sauce what people eat be up to they what we should be do be ensure that they be pay well and in stable work and then they can choose the good nutritious and sustainable food that they want to eat rather than have to go to some place to beg for food just to live interruption sorry this be something feel really passionately about at the heart of all this be inequality what the resurgam trust community fridge do well be link it all together we be deal with situation in which some of the big issue of the day include housing and health be all link it be because we have take thing for grant some of the wealthy people live in my lagan valley constituency there be house on the market at to million but on the estate in lisburn what people be eat be not healthy and be not good for they can also list the associate health problem which include various comorbiditie obesity heart disease and cancer really worry about the impact of ultra process food particularly on young people we be see stark rise in colorectal cancer in particular know that some people be reluctant to make that link and be not explicitly make it but we have fundamentally change the sort of food that we eat could go and do supermarket shop today and buy something call noodle but they be not noodle at all do not know what they be make of be not very good at science but know that margarine be one molecule away from plastic be that the sort of stuff that we should be eat it do not sound good to to eat plastic that be the bare reality of it we also tell people to eat their five day yes they should but the number of pesticide and herbicide in some of our food worry some people might not want to hear that people think that they be eat healthy food but we must consider how we process that food be shocked to learn about how we classify process food some of which relatively educate person would have think be unprocessed but be not can not remember which hon member say that ingredient be market as cereal with certain vitamin for example which sound great but that actually that be nonsense we could not put anything more unhealthy on our child plate that go back to my early point if people be short on time and money it be because of choice that we have make in this chamber and in chamber right across europe and the world we have make the choice to deprive people and family whether they be family unit carer or people who look after child do not think that that choice be right we can not turn around now and decry the obesity epidemic whenever we be not support people to live and work well simply ask that we look at the other external factor link to this yes it be about food and yes we should be do more but we should not be consider that in isolation we in this house be task with the job of look after every constituent in the uk that should be as much about ensure that they have roof above their head as it be about ensure that they have choice of nutritious and affordable food because we have give they good stable job that be all ask send that message strongly from my lagan valley constituent this have be an excellent and wide range debate and be so happy to have the opportunity to speak in it commend the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke who have work with over number of year for his excellent speech it be always really hard to talk about oneself but he do it with grace listen to his really thoughtful contribution today will have help lot of people it have definitely help as hon member know be huge supporter of school food make lot of contribution about it in this place believe that it should be universal for all the reason that will go on to discuss it be not only about stigma poverty alleviation and all of that but about the health benefit that all child eat healthy school food would bring especially in regard to their diet and obesity look at school up and down the country the food that they serve be far too inconsistent we have see some brilliant example across the country we have all visit school in our constituency that serve variety of salad and nutritious hot meal but other be serve thing like pizza burger or chip far more often than they should be do under the school food standard that be damage the health of generation the report by the house of lords food diet and obesity committee chair by the wonderful baroness walmsley discuss the fact that too many secondary school in particular be serve up food that be not prepare student for the rest of their school day as member across the house know this be where the school food standard should come in however study by impact on urban health show significant difference between what be mandate by the school food standard what appear on menu and what actually end up on plate in fact of secondary school have be find not to follow the school food standard at all in other word the school food standard exist on paper but not on plate that be why across the sector and in this house we have be call for proper enforcement of the school food standard this government must end the postcode lottery in what child get to eat at lunchtime there be no great priority for this government than raise the healthy generation of child ever this be matter of health one in three child be already at risk of future food relate ill health such as type diabete or heart disease by the age of exist government initiative be already go above and beyond to combat that and provide free breakfast to every primary school child will ensure that pupil be start their day nourish and ready to learn but there be more to be do the department for education have report that of family nationally who be entitle to claim free school meal have not apply to receive they this mean that between and child in england the figure seem to vary depend on who you talk to but it be large number be miss out on their statutory right to free school meal this be due to barrier such as complex application language or literacy challenge stigma and low awareness an auto enrolment plan as outline by my hon friend the member for crawley peter lamb in his private member bill the free school meals automatic registration of eligible children bill and by my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher in his opening speech would solve the problem many local authority have already have massive success but data share challenge or bureaucracy should not prevent child from eat at school especially when they be entitle to free school meal because free school meal be statutory scheme government funding should already exist to provide the up to miss child with school lunch so this should not be see as spending commitment that funding also unlock vital pupil premium funding since sheffield city council have unlock million of extra pupil premium funding every single year to support child small tweak like auto enrolment really can have huge impact on thousand of child life another concern that must be address be the scarily low eligibility criterion for free school meal household must be earn less than year before benefit to be entitle that leave out up to child who be live in poverty by any measure but be not in receipt of that crucial support we have hear example of child pretend to eat from empty lunchboxe hide in the playground because they do not want other to know that they do not have any food or money for lunch or ask their friend for an extra sandwich for their friend who never have any food for lunch we must bring the eligibility criterion in line with universal credit which would provide those child with hot nutritious meal at lunchtime surely that be the least we should be do in one of the rich country in the world in an ideal world we would follow the example of the london mayor and extend free school meal to all primary age child with the ambition of universal offer this would level the play field and eliminate inequality at lunchtime while also ensure that all child eat healthy nutritious meal set they up for healthy life as adult with low rate of obesity as we have hear that would save up to billion year it be win win surely these progressive step empower by the new breakfast club programme should be take when funding allow the result would speak for themselves deliver on our ambitious manifesto commitment for the uk to be raise the healthy generation of child ever surely they deserve no less they be our future after all thank everyone for their contribution so far in particular thank the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke for his contribution it be very personal story and when we tell personal story in this chamber or anywhere else it always carry more weight that be not pun by the way it carry different focus and thank the right hon gentleman for share that story we all thank he for share it because it may inspire other outside this chamber who find his word wise and helpful be happy to speak in this debate declare an interest as type diabetic my story of diabetes be personal to but it be one that many go through have experience the health problem that fast food diet bring when discover be type diabetic back in weigh some stone be in the northern ireland assembly we be at the scottish parliament in edinburgh and have be to see my doctor because have some pain that man get in certain place and have some concern over they dr mageean phone in edinburgh and say jim ve good news for you do you want the good news or the bad news say well dr mageean give the good news first that get on good form he say the good news be that you ve get heart like an ox the bad news be that you diabetic why have become diabetic do not recognise it because do not know what diabetes be be diabetic probably year before the doctor tell that day live on chinese meal five night per week and two bottle of coke the sugar content be extreme and be stone doctor mageean tell jim it be up to you how you handle this his very wise word to be jim it be up to you what you do but if you do not do the right thing it will progressively get bad go on diet that day and lose an extreme amount of weight along with that of course have fairly high stress level be able to make those change and lose stone in weight which keep stable for while then go on to the metformin tablet the linagliptin tablet the jardiance tablet and all the other one in the morning start with nine tablet and finish the day with five many other will do similar thing because that be how we keep alive and how we manage it coffee become substitute drink copious cup day use to drink cup of coffee day and have reduce that to six mostly in the morning with five before there be probably side effect from drink too much coffee as well tell all these story to make the point that the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold make he say that we have to do it ourselves and we do that be how it work although understand some people can not over the year have help numerous people with gastric band operation they have all be successful and it have help those people they have special circumstance and they be able to lose weight the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood refer to food bank and my food bank in newtownards can give diabetic food to those who have diabete and those food can help to manage diabete remember my mum tell when be child always eat your carrot and your eyesight will never go astray well it do not work for it be not an issue for because love carrot and love vegetable the carrot do not do any good but my mum do perhaps engrain in the necessity to eat green the six day or five day as it be my lifestyle be unhealthy which lead to lifelong consequence it also mean that understand how very easy it be for convenience and lack of time to lead to an unhealthy option which be why would like to focus on how we can make healthy meal more accessible be aware that it can be daunt as parent with young child to try to work out healthy option that child will eat which be also affordable and do not take too long to make it be clear that more work need to be do to help young family particularly to get the skill to cook and to create good eat pattern in family of all income be really pleased to see the minister in his place and look forward to his answer because he be away constructive in his answer my son and daughter in law be stay with we and they have two child freya four and ezra two and half and as grandfather have notice that they have their child eat their vegetable from very early age which help get that focus in place at an early stage one of my local resident association scrabo resident association in conjunction with ards community network have use funding to put on class for family to learn how to cook in cost effective and healthy way their fun innovative and informative class help with budgeting and planning and they know they be successful however as so often the government funding for that process have no long continue there be therefore less of an incentive for those volunteer group in the community network to do that which be problem can the minister give any indication of whether he and his department be prepared to target that area to help family understand that there be way to save money on healthy food the late datum for northern ireland show that of adult and about one in child or some be live with obesity and the development of obesity be strongly link to deprivation the hon member for lagan valley refer to deprivation and it be so important for people to have decent wage to buy the right food to look after themselves between and one in three or of primary year child live in the most deprived area be more likely to be overweight or obese compare with those live in the least deprived area that represent percentage point increase since when the figure be it be now of primary year child which be real problem for we in northern ireland although be sure those figure be replicate on the mainland obesity also increase the risk of develop chronic disease such as colon cancer high blood pressure or type diabete and it be link to substantial direct and indirect cost estimate to be in the order of million in northern ireland in what be those cost today look to the minister to consider the approach that have refer to as he and other know always try to be constructive in my comment and in describe what we have do in northern ireland what be available to help community put on the training and help people realise that healthy eating be not just for those who can afford to shop at wholefood and organic grocery but for all of we and that it can be easy to cook such food in the daily struggle of feed our family obesity be tick time bomb we need to defuse it with co ordinate and join up approach and funding be the foundation of that echo early comment by thank all member who have contribute to this debate as new member it have be hearten to hear so much agreement across the house and so many colleague put their evidence enthusiasm and opinion into find solution to this epidemic thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for introduce this debate unlike my hon friend who have medical degree and have become gp take my medical degree and go into public health be public health consultant and that be why be here it have be fantastic to hear everybody in this house talk in such resoundingly positive public health term it be past time for we to address this issue many great point have be make and do not intend to repeat they but would like to stress couple of thing start with an interesting observation about the term obesity it carry with it certain load and stigma which as female very much recognise want to put on record that this be not about fat sham this be not about how people look or how society tell we we should look this be about our health this be about be well and feel well and be able to live well and thrive also want to put on record something about body mass index this be slightly controversial subject in my area at the moment it be useful tool as people have say but as my hon friend the member for ilford south jas athwal mention there be different level of bmi for different ethnicity and also it can be limited metric the house might be aware of the case of female olympic bodybuilder be class as obese we need to be careful about bmi and what we be say to people child or adult when we see their bmi this be about take health in the round and look at what we eat not what we look like there be no debate about the evidence of obesity cost to our population health and our health system we have hear the figure from multiple member across the house and billion annually to the national health service be no small figure we be literally eat ourselves into our sick bed from diabete to heart attack from liver disease to cancer as we have hear this be the second most preventable cause after tobacco of cancer have speak before in the house and will continue to do so about create condition for people to thrive and to make healthy choice today as so many hon member have highlight we live in an obesogenic environment an environment that promote unhealthy eating and do not make it easy to undertake regular exercise less familiar term be the opposite of that and perhaps hansard have never hear it leptogenic environment promote healthy food choice and encourage physical activity the comment on housing and on fair pay for good work be about leptogenic environment we might reflect on our own environment madam deputy speaker whether it be an obesogenic or leptogenic environment wonder how many of we have manage to have dinner yet this evening and how we be feel that be something for the modernisation committee to reflect on to achieve leptogenic environment we need to look at measure that create function food system as we have hear we need to work with our farmer and food producer to produce skilled food sector and vibrant food economy for our food system to allow we all to enjoy healthy food again we have hear this before we need to ensure that it be accessible affordable and attractive we be visual creature what we see really influence we and our choice and boy do the food organisation and the food company know that on accessibility how easy be it to buy nutritious food we have hear member across the house talk about their constituency their resident food desert and how for some people when they go into shop the choice be not from an array of vegetable fruit decent carbohydrate and decent protein but from process often cheap quite fill nutritionally poor food that be not make healthy food accessible on affordability we have hear several time from different member that healthy food this be worth repeat on average be more than twice as expensive per calorie as less healthy option if people feed their child across the country this week on budget be face with two different option and one be cheap and will fill their child stomach the odd be that they be likely to take that option and there be no judgment in that at all it be on we to make healthy food much more accessible and affordable for people on attractiveness how attractive be healthy food we have hear this evening about the marketing and branding of ultra process high fat high sugar high salt food it be fantastic that our labour government and our minister for public health and prevention my hon friend the member for gorton and denton andrew gwynne have take the step to ban junk food advertisement before the watershed that be great step forward but we need to be mindful of how much investment the major brand of high fat high sugar and high salt food put into advertising in digital advertising alone that figure be million food organisation do not put money into thing if they do not make profit from they profit essentially remain their bottom line not our waistline these be systemic issue but we do not need to reinvent the wheel we need to implement the wide range recommendation of the national food strategy the last government miss that opportunity but as we move forward with this government let we look at those recommendation many of which have be mention in the house this evening they include introduce sugar and salt reformulation tax and expand the healthy start scheme in conclusion we need to ensure that we in this place be legislate to make good nutrition an easy choice for all and that we be curate healthy leptogenic environment in that way we will ensure that we be enable healthy choice for all our resident and reduce obesity to slim historical footnote as we move forward into healthy future for everyone thank the hon member for stroud dr opher for secure this important debate and thank all the member who have contribute so passionately when we talk about obesity and in particular childhood obesity we must not overlook the structural barrier that prevent healthy choice several key policy could make transformative difference and will draw attention to some of those tonight but will start by say that every family in the uk in the century should have access to affordable healthy and nutritious food the pandemic contribute to an increase in household food insecurity and food poverty widen health inequality recent increase in food cost have become one of the primary contributor to the cost of living crisis tackle food insecurity in our community be step towards reduce obesity it require restructuring of the whole system that take into consideration how we produce source sell and prepare our food early year nutrition be critical financial support scheme need to be expand and increase in value the current rate be inadequate leave many family unable to provide their child with nutritious start in life expand free school meal would be game changer the lack of healthy nutritious diet do not just affect physical health it affect child ability to learn and thrive universal access to free school meal would ensure that every child have at least one nutritious meal day reduce health inequality and support educational attainment last year stratford on avon district council on which be councillor pass unanimously my motion to tackle food insecurity in our area it include look at how planning policy can help reduce unhealthy diet by for example encourage community food grow the creation of food co operative and limit the spread of fast food outlet pay tribute to the warwickshire food forum partnership which develop warwickshire wide food strategy along the priority of access and affordability food education and sustainable choice welcome the right to food campaign support by many council in england that be work towards make access to food legal right embed food justice in their policy and call on the government to have the right to food enshrine in law finally we need to look at how we disincentivise unhealthy food choice that be high in calorie and low in nutrient the soft drink industry levy have be effective but we must close some of its loophole by extend it to high sugar food and milk base drink that revenue could be reinveste in public health initiative create positive cycle of prevent disease such measure and policy be not just about tackle obesity but about create healthy and fairer society urge the government to make the change that our community so desperately need thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for secure this important and informative debate will start with some statistic over the last seven year southend have see one of the high increase in england in the number of child live with obesity with of five year old start school with weight classify as overweight or obese that rise to by the time they leave primary school the chief medical officer professor sir chris whitty find in his annual report that coastal community be some of the worst affect by rise childhood obesity rate along with many other preventable health harm it be not fair that where someone live can affect their family and their child health outcome in southend we have see not only that increase in obesity but the closing of sport facility concur with my hon friend the member for swindon north will stone with regard to physical activity and exercise which be also vital component in the debate recently visit hamstel infant and junior school whose swimming pool have unfortunately be close down in that scenario student who predominantly come from low socioeconomic background do not have access to local swimming facility that be yet another facility to close down leave child with less opportunity for physical activity more widely in swim england report that almost swimming pool could be lose by which be simply unacceptable the trend be not limit to swimming since nearly public football pitch have be lose across the uk childhood obesity be complex issue and the closure of sport facility be certainly not the only contribute factor to the increase poor diet and the cost of living crisis also play considerable part poor diet be one of the big preventable risk factor in ill health contribute to low life expectancy and early onset illness the cost of living crisis and compounding pressure on family pay packet mean that child from low socioeconomic background and area do not have the option of healthy diet healthy food be twice as expensive calorie for calorie as less healthy food that be simply not good enough we need to improve health outcome for child in southend and in rochford and create the condition for they to thrive as many member will know the house of lords inquiry into food diet and obesity set recommendation that have be support by key organisation such as the obesity health alliance in fact over the past year we have have strategy to address obesity contain almost policy recommendation in that time obesity have double this pose major health risk for our country and catastrophic cost to our nhs and workforce the vast majority of recommendation be not implement under the last government the few that be implement place the burden on the individual and ignore the necessary structural change our labour government have be clear in our mission on health and the nhs to shift the narrative from ill health to prevention we be already make change the advertising of unhealthy food will be ban across all medium before pm from october we could go one step far and put an end to the advertising of less healthy food altogether furthermore we could introduce more stringent labelling and regulation on snack so that company can no long mislead parent with false tagline such as one of your five day or source of protein on food with huge amount of sugar finally we could investigate introduce salt and sugar tax on food manufacturer build on the success of the soft drink levy the government could use that revenue to make healthy food cheap particularly for people live with food insecurity our labour government be on mission to improve living standard to do that we need to make change where the previous government fail they include tackle obesity head on with well access to sport facility well protection around the marketing of unhealthy food and ease the pressure of the cost of living crisis my constituency face some of the high level of food relate health problem and deprivation in the country with the second high density of fast food outlet in the country and high level of poverty many of my constituent lack access to nutritious food obesity be one of the most difficult issue we face in blackpool of adult be overweight or live with obesity in child of reception age that figure be but by year it be shocking these be some of the reason why the house of lords food diet and obesity committee visit blackpool last year its report recipe for health highlight blackpool not only as critical case study but for our potential to lead meaningful change the report demonstrate that blackpool be food desert with many area lack access to fresh fruit and vegetable instead fast food outlet dominate the landscape offer cheap high calorie option that often be the only affordable choice for family on budget in fact blackpool be among the place where food insecurity be most deeply feel with rise reliance on food bank and emergency food parcel the report stress that community such as blackpool need well access to healthy and affordable food for blackpool that could mean revitalise local food market set up food hub and create partnership between local farmer and resident to bring fresh food directly into our community that would bypass the high price and limited option of the supermarket offer more sustainable way to source food locally at the same time the report suggest reform the food environment in blackpool and other area face similar challenge where fast food outlet be prevalent by limit the number of unhealthy outlet and support the growth of healthy business the town could make it easy for resident to make well food choice such small change could have big impact on public health one of the most important recommendation in the report be for food education to be priority in blackpool where diet relate illness be rampant provide nutrition education could make real difference that could include teach people how to cook healthy meal on budget and offer workshop in school to help child to understand the importance of good nutrition late last year visit blackpool learning rooms where this approach be already under way the council operate project have kitchen where meet adult learner on the eat well spend less course which run fun and informative class teach the basic of cookery and budgeting the report also highlight the importance of local food initiative project such as community kitchen urban farm and food co op be already take root in blackpool with the like of at the grange which committee member visit the community centre have an on site grow project grow blackpool and café offer affordable and nutritious food on housing estate that have no shop sell fresh food project such as at the grange could be the key to transform our food system help people to access healthy affordable food and create strong and more resilient community the food landscape in blackpool clearly need urgent attention but the town also hold an opportunity to lead the way in transform our food system the recipe for health report paint picture of well future where community like those in my constituency be healthy more sustainable and more connected to the food we eat local organisation like the blackpool food partnership and blackpool food bank alongside jamie oliver ministry of food be already make stride in this direction by work together community group local authority business and entrepreneur can create more sustainable equitable food system that put health at its centre the key be to invest in these community lead project and ensure that everyone no matter their income have access to healthy affordable food if blackpool can implement the change suggest in the food diet and obesity committee report it could serve as model for town across the uk local food hub healthy eating habit well education and shift in the food environment could change our future it will not happen overnight and it will not be easy but the foundation be already there with the right investment and support from both local and national leadership blackpool can become shin example of how we can build more sustainable food system and healthy community congratulate my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher on secure what have be powerful and impactful debate it have reflect the personal experience and relationship that people have with food which can be complex my interest in this subject start as councillor in west lothian when become acutely aware of the grow financial pressure that have leave people really struggle to put food on the table my experience with constituent experience hardship lead to champion the co operative party food justice campaign and initiate the set up of the west lothian food network the network which consist of local third sector and community group have evolve over the year initially set up just day before lockdown it end up provide emergency food support to those in financial hardship and experience social isolation during the pandemic today the network be member organisation that address inequality and support those on low income from rural area and from disadvantaged group who be at risk of poor health outcome because of food insecurity put on the record my thank to all the staff and volunteer from those organisation that have play part in the network over the year include west lothian food bank also thank the team at storehouse which support my constituent in that area with the increase obesity gap between the most and least deprive health inequality be also on the rise the reality in scotland be startling as we have already hear two third of all adult be overweight and third of child start primary school at risk of be overweight one in six scot be on waiting list and there be no doubt that many will be there due to obesity and diet relate health complaint with many more on long term medication for condition such as high blood pressure osteoarthritis and type diabete the damage of unhealthy food do not fall evenly across the country the vast majority of billboard for junk food advertising be target towards the most income deprive community and fast food outlet make up significantly high proportion of local food option again that be something hear time and again as councillor many community be cry out for fresh fruit and veg shop but all they see be more fast food outlet open it have become worryingly common that community that have the least do not have access to choice when it come to where they shop we have hear about food desert limited transportation option far compound the problem if someone do not drive and they live in an area that be ill serve by bus or train route the food that be more likely to be on offer to they will be highly process with less nutritional value high in salt fat and sugar and often more expensive the underlie pressure on time local infrastructure and earning impact on the freedom to choose and the ability to lead healthy life be very grateful for organisation such as the whitburn community development trust and the west lothian foodbank which have community garden and take the produce from the garden and put they directly into their pantry to support people to access nutritious healthy food but if you live in an area where there be no such group or community garden and if you be struggle financially to put food on the table and you have no way to make it to low cost supermarket that do have healthy option can we really say that you have choice adult on low income be more than twice as likely to have diet that be high in sugar saturate fat and salt and low in fibre fruit vegetable and fish we know that weak diet from young age be detrimental to long term development and health that impact can be see in our hospital where as we hear tooth decay be the most common reason for the admission of child lack of access to local dentist be an issue raise at prime minister question last week in scotland we have the shameful statistic that one in four child be start school with tooth decay the cost be personal and societal the human cost of obesity can be measure in increasingly impaired mobility slow recovery from illness and early physical decline last year diabetes uk report that in scotland the number of case of people under live with type diabete rise by almost third between and in frontier economics estimate that the total economic impact of obesity in the uk be billion include cost to the nhs and social care lose productivity workforce inactivity and welfare payment diabete care alone account for nearly of the nhs budget the scale of the pressure demand urgency in how we respond the impact on the economy can be measure in lose productivity but most importantly it reflect really worrying trend the shrink work population great social isolation and the rise in the number of people with complex health need policy often talk of the last mile the final few yard to get support over the line and accessible to those who need it most in my view that must be the first and most essential mile there be national change that we can make and that we have make welcome the government new restriction on advertising to child with the new watershed restriction and online advert ban as strong first step to reduce exposure we have to do more to make food accessible cheap and more available in community where they have the least the uprating of the sugar levy will force business to far innovate their product low the sugar content and find taste without rely on unhealthy additive the revenue raise as we have hear could be use to address the gap in accessibility to healthy food at community level particularly in those area with the great challenge look forward to that constructive conversation continue across the house do nothing be not an option if we be to have healthy workforce in future reduce health inequality face those with the least and leave our child legacy of living long healthy and more active life thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for secure this important debate the grow prevalence of obesity be public emergency it be profoundly affect not only individual life but the economic and social fabric of our nation let clearly state that this be not debate about willpower or individual choice it be about the system environment and inequality that shape those choice what do it say about our country when child in area of deprivation be twice as likely to experience obesity as their peer in wealthy community when child in the least well off family eat significantly few fruit and vegetable or when family with the low income be more than twice as likely to consume diet that be high in sugar salt and fat to it say that we be fail those on the low income as physiotherapist have work with family grapple with the challenge of face childhood obesity have see the emotional toll on child who be bully or exclude and the frustration of parent who have no access to affordable healthy food or safe space for their child to play in medical practitioner be also witness the impact on people mental health obesity be not merely about calorie in and calorie out the medical journal the lancet have rightly describe it as complex adaptive system there be battle to be have against obesity on so many level it start with government policy on housing and education and behaviour relate to diet and exercise there be also biological factor at play include genetic age and ethnicity the further statistic be alarming in england two third of adult live with obesity or be overweight and be severely obese among child the situation be equally troubling the weight of one in five child enter primary school be above healthy level and by the time they leave the figure rise to one in three this be compound by societal change and challenge the high cost of live and of healthy food the prevalence of product high in fat sugar or salt and environment saturate with fast food outlet and inadequate green space the financial cost be staggering obesity relate illness currently cost the nhs billion year figure project to rise to billion by across the economy the broad impact include loss of productivity have be estimate to be billion each year to address this multifaceted crisis we must adopt systematic whole society approach we need key intervention to help we to deal with our obesity public health problem we must make change such as expand the healthy start scheme and increase the value of payment to reflect rise food cost perhaps look again at the advertising ban and consider whether we should go far incentivise business to reformulate product to reduce salt sugar and fat content support after school activity hub to increase physical activity among child strengthen school food standard to ensure that child have access to nutritional food create and maintain safe accessible green space thus encourage outdoor activity reduce sedentary behaviour and improve mental health and design urban environment that prioritise active travel such as walk and cycle through well infrastructure for instance cycle lane and pedestrian zone the government should adopt comprehensive food strategy with independent oversight from the food standards agency target should be set for reduce the availability of product with high level of fat sugar or salt and increase the number of healthy food option local authority should be empower with great planning and licensing control to limit the proliferation of fast food outlet and promote healthy eating parliament have responsibility to lead on this issue we must move away from the medicalise paradigm that isolate obesity as an individual issue and focus on the societal structure that underpin it policy must address the root cause of inequality which drive the disproportionate impact of obesity on low income family call on the government to enact bold decisive measure to transform our food system and environment this be not just about health it be about fairness opportunity and create future in which no child potential be limit by the circumstance of where they be bear let we grab the opportunity to address obesity comprehensively by put health equality and wellbee at the heart of our policy too thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for secure this really important debate and for his thoughtful and incredibly insightful speech on one of the big health challenge that our country face as many member have say after week delay be glad that we be now able to have this debate and it have be great to see how much consensus there be across the house on the need to act as we set out in our manifesto and as the consultation on the year plan for the nhs say we must move towards have much sharp focus on the prevention of ill health for the sake of the long term viability of our nhs as other member have say there be huge crisis with grow level of obesity put the nation health at risk in my constituency nearly dartford resident meet the definition of obese such statistic denote immense health inequality with those on low income far more likely to be obese as other member have point out there be plenty of reason why we must take action in this area we spend billion annually on treat obesity relate ill health and around billion year on diabete with the number of type diabetes diagnosis double over the last year aside from the financial cost we should surely wish for people to live long healthy life this month be privileged to be spend my tuesdays and thursdays on the public bill committee for the tobacco and vapes bill landmark piece of legislation that we will go through line by line among other measure it will prevent anyone bear after january from purchase tobacco be very pleased to see in this chamber number of colleague who be also on that journey with include the minister and the shadow minister the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson the argument that we hear against obesity intervention today be the same one that we hear about restrict smoking in day go by that it be nanny state that regulatory approach do not work that the public will not stand for it and that it make thing more expensive which impact on those who can least afford it one of the great public health legacy of the last labour government be their intervention on smoking smoking be to the last labour government what obesity can be to the current one obesity currently place staggering burden on the nhs and the wide economy but it will be one of the great legacy of this government if we can turn thing around and make our country healthy solution be urgently need very much welcome the government plan to review the sugar tax and to consider extend it to milk base drink as many member have say however we need to go so much far include by tax food that be high in salt fat and sugar as recommend by the house of lords inquiry manufacturer reformulate their product in the face of the soft drink industry levy and see no reason why that can not happen with well design levy on food high in fat salt and sugar very much welcome the government commitment to ban advertisement for junk food aim at child and the sale of high caffeine energy drink to and look forward to work with member of different party to tackle this crisis in my time in local government have see how support less well off family to replace unhealthy food in their diet with fresh fruit and vegetable such as through the programme run by the alexandra rose trust which other have mention tonight have have transformative impact on family physical and mental health urge the government to fund voucher scheme introduce food ambassador to improve cooking skill and encourage food grow as part of the solution as we be in veganuary commend the work to increase the level of plant base food in people diet hasten to add that be not vegan myself although do aspire to eat more healthily veganuary and vegan diet be good for our health and good for the planet that could be part of the solution and urge the minister and other particularly those in local government to consider it too thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for his persistence in secure this debate the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke talk in his captivate speech about the difference between adult obesity and childhood obesity my cheshire colleague the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth talk about choice but of course child do not always have choice they be the one hope to speak for tonight in mid cheshire the level of child measure as overweight be worryingly high the statistic broadly track the england average but there be some notable significant peak and trough with over of child in year measure as overweight in six ward out of child from the most deprived area of england be twice as likely to be live with obesity as those from the least deprived area which demonstrate that persistent inequality exist in childhood obesity that track with the pattern in my constituency worryingly more than half of child live with obesity go on to be obese adolescent and more than three quarter of obese adolescent become obese adult this be certainly reflect in the level of adult obesity locally and nationally in my area over of adult be class as live with overweight or with obesity which be more than the england average of it be sometimes too easy to reduce the issue to cold statistic do so not only fail to recognise the real consequence of obesity both on individual and on society but overlook its cause we certainly can not ignore the impact of food and diet on obesity particularly in the context of health inequality and the current cost of living crisis the food choice we make be heavily influence by our environment and socioeconomic status it be crucial to understand that the availability and accessibility of healthy food option be not the same for everyone health inequality persist in our society with many individual and family face barrier that hinder their ability to make nutritious food choice these disparity be far exacerbate by the cost of living crisis in which rise price of essential good have force many people to prioritise affordability over nutritional value in that environment unhealthy process food often become the most accessible option lead to rise in obesity rate among vulnerable community the consequence of obesity be profound particularly for our child study show that child struggle with obesity be at high risk of myriad health issue include diabetes heart disease asthma and mental health challenge beyond the physical ramification obesity can limit their life chance this cycle of disadvantage not only impact their present but shape their future create lasting legacy of inequality that follow they into adulthood the evidence could not be clear that inequality and obesity be intrinsically link the repercussion from both constitute notable source of morbidity and impaired quality of life and their complication can have major bearing on life expectancy the toll on individual health be staggering but it be only part of the story beyond individual health we must consider the wide economic and societal consequence of obesity the cost associate with treat obesity relate illness strain our nhs and divert resource from other essential service as obesity rate continue to rise so too do the burden on our healthcare system the annual billion cost of obesity be project to increase to billion by the total cost to the uk economy include nhs treatment cost and lose productivity be estimate to be staggering billion per year we bear collective responsibility to address the root cause of food and diet on obesity to tackle not only the individual health implication but the implication to our wide society to do so we must advocate policy that promote healthy food environment ensure equitable access to nutritious food and support family in make healthy choice regardless of their financial situation education and awareness must also play critical role in this effort by empower individual with knowledge about nutrition and healthy lifestyle we can help to break the cycle of obesity be proud that this labour government be commit to lead on bold food strategy similarly welcome the introduction of school breakfast club through the children wellbeing and schools bill and the update to the national planning policy framework on the siting of hot food takeaway the promotion of increase access to green space and sustainable transport both policy will help in the fight to tackle childhood obesity address systemic health inequality and promote positive health outcome however give the clear statistical link between poverty inequality and childhood obesity we must bear down on child poverty in this parliament if we be to tackle the issue look forward to hear more from the child poverty taskforce when it report this year address obesity be not just moral imperative it be critical to support this government effort to ensure the long term sustainability of the nhs to break down barrier to opportunity and to increase economic productivity as we have hear today the impact of food and diet on obesity be multifaceted issue that require our immediate attention by implement effective policy and work towards healthy future we can create society in which everyone can thrive free from the burden of obesity and its associate health challenge bariatric bed be special big strong bed use in hospital for extremely obese people when be medical student there be no such thing as bariatric bed not invent not need but then hospital do not have food bank for their staff either so how have we get our relationship with food into such mess the epidemic of obesity be public health emergency cost billion million of our citizen be die early the government simply must act this can not be leave to the market we do it with smoking and now we will do it with obesity we have no choice we know that at the heart of the matter be high fat high sugar high salt factory produce food that be often ultra process cheap convenient tasty and very profitable for few very large food business nor must we forget that it be our poor citizen who be most affect those who be cash poor time poor and at high risk of poor diet we can not continue like this the government must act to change food habit this be not the nanny state this be simply good government smoking kill it say on cigarette packet some food kill too so how about the food in this packet will kill you if it be not part of healthy mixed diet obesity be massive issue for surgeon increase morbidity and mortality although we can staple stomachs or inject up to million people with anti obesity drug we all know that that be not the answer let we use the power of government to legislate warning on food packet breakfast club in school which we have already introduce advertising ban tax incentive cook education and an end to the dependence on the cheap unhealthy food that blight the life of so many of our citizen we have no choice thank my hon friend for give way during very interesting speech do he agree that the national curriculum review present the government with an opportunity to encourage and strengthen the healthy eat component of the relationship sex and health education curriculum so that citizen and especially young people be empower to make healthy decision on eat my hon friend intervention be not really an intervention because have reach the end of what wish to say nevertheless thank he sincerely it be pleasure to close the debate for the liberal democrats congratulate the hon member for stroud dr opher on secure the debate all the contribution include his opening speech have be excellent and well informed be particularly interested to hear about the existence of good food desert in blackpool south and liverpool west derby even in shropshire where we grow some of the most wonderful and nutritious food that can be imagine we have high than average obesity rate of adult be overweight and be medically obese that be an interesting reflection on the availability of good food and on people ability to choose healthy option because of the cost of food at the supermarket in rural area housing be more expensive but average wage be low if people can not access public transport as the hon member for bathgate and linlithgow kirsteen sullivan point out they be often force to shop at expensive local shop and be thereby force into buy packet of less nutritious food we need to deal with obesity two third of the adult population be overweight the nhs be spend almost tenth of its annual budget on diabete obesity have significant impact on the health and wellbeing of people who deserve well they be three time more likely to develop colon cancer two and half time more likely to have high blood pressure and five time more likely to have type diabete the history of tackle those problem be litany of failure for all three major party in year of government because as other hon member have mention we have have different policy on the issue over the year with no impact it be time for coherent strategy to tackle the obesity crisis it be good to tentatively welcome the government new national food strategy and their step on junk food advertising which be positive move the liberal democrats would like to see the government go far particularly on the use outdoor advertising in area where people be particularly vulnerable to see it for example we want local authority to be allow to restrict outdoor advertising near school be interested in some of the suggestion that have be make about planning and fast food outlet especially as of child age to be now overweight staggering rise since that coincide with fall in spending on obesity relate measure in the public health grant during the same period we welcome the government propose preventive measure we hope that some of the large sum earmark for health and the nhs in the recent budget can be put into public health and prevention measure because we want to stop people get unhealthy in the first place rather than deal with the problem after it occur in shropshire one in five child age four to five be overweight and more than one in be obese ironically almost half be not eat enough fruit and veg despite the fact that they be grow all around we the same number be not active enough to encourage activity we could introduce different classification for leisure centre hon member have mention the importance of swimming pool and place to become fit and healthy know that the hon member for stroud say that the food element be more important than the activity element none the less we should be encourage get fit as part of healthy lifestyle will the minister consider make leisure centre part of our critical health infrastructure so people can rely on their leisure centre stay open and can have somewhere to go if they can not exercise in their home or their local area healthy eating help with other preventable problem such as tooth decay my hon friend the member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord mention poor oral health another avoidable issue that we can deal with the importance of good oral health in care home have recently be impressed on by various member of the dentistry profession because poor oral health can lead to aspirated pneumonia that be partially separate issue from obesity but unhealthy and sugary snack be be offer to people in care home so wonder whether we can encourage healthy eating in those setting as well as in our school and hospital there be no get away from the fact that obesity be intrinsically link to inequality and deprivation since the cost of weekly food shop have rise by almost third as mention rural area be not exclude in shropshire of household be struggle with food poverty or as prefer to call it poverty there be high risk of cost of live vulnerability for child who be in poverty lot of members speak about the great work of their local food bank in shropshire an organisation call osnosh take food that be due to be throw away by the supermarket at the end of the day but be still perfectly good to eat the next day it produce fantastic chef cook lunch that people can enjoy if people be able to pay for those lunch they can do so if they be not they do not have to it be wonderful way of bring the community together to eat good food without the stigma of not be able to afford it however think we all agree that reliance on the third sector to solve this problem be not really acceptable in the modern age so lift family out of poverty must be priority for the government our policy be for free school meal for all child in poverty and roll out of free school meal to all primary school be our ambition when fund allow hope that the government also have the ambition when fund allow of lift the two child benefit cap which would lift quarter of million child out of poverty holiday activity and food programme happen across the country not just locally in the summer visit haf programme in oswestry at which child be offer healthy meal day out of the home often in much safe environment than their home and good day of activity the organisation that deliver that in oswestry the new saints foundation offer it not just to child whose family can not afford nutritious meal at home but to all child to remove the stigma and give all the kid fun day at the haf programme future funding for haf programme be not certain so will the minister clarify what will happen to they they be really good way to ensure that child eat healthily through the holiday as well as when they be at school and in receipt of free school meal the hon member for stroud also mention labelling be conscious of time so will be fairly brief with this little anecdote labelling can be really misleading even to parent who be comfortably off would not describe myself as the most well off and well meaning it be long time ago so will not mention the brand but resort to buy an organic brand of food for my child when we be at the puree stage of weaning he become so addicted to it that it become really difficult to wean he off on to something much more nutritious fill and healthy such that have sleepless night every night because he be still hungry one evening have very embarrassing moment in the supermarket almost have breakdown because have bump into an old friend and the supermarket have sell out of these food pouch and that be complete disaster find out later that although the puree be organic and have no add sugar it be actually really high in sugar it be essentially just pear water and some spelt so it be really sweet and sugary have inadvertently give my child something that have expect to be healthy but be not good labelling would have solve that problem be sure that it would help many parent whose child have single brand addiction it be year ago and the brand may well have reformulate since then which be why will not mention the name but it be something that we need to be aware of the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke speak powerfully about his own struggle with his weight and he mention the use of various different type of jab to tackle obesity do not think that we should dismiss jab out of hand clearly they be very helpful for some people but really think that the government emphasis need to be on prevention and on public health strategy to stop people get to the point of need to use those drug in the first place the uk should be one of the healthy country in the world we have great history of grassroots sport the high quality food production imaginable and world lead medical research but we be become sicker and fall behind similar country it be time to act we welcome the junk food advertising ban and restriction on high caffeine energy drink as really good first step we also welcome the commitment to national food strategy put in plea for our farmer who work to very low margin ask for the strategy to consider the role of the groceries code adjudicator and ensure that our farmer be keep in business to continue to deliver our food finally please consider our call for prevention to give child healthy start in life should declare an interest as child doctor and farmer wife we all want to live healthy life it give we healthy life expectancy reduce illness burden and give we more happy year to spend with those whom we love however begin in the second half of the century and continue today the developed world have see an unprecedented rise in obesity level the growth of high calorie process food and sugary drink along with our more sedentary lifestyle have undoubtedly play key role in the uk two third of adult be classify as overweight or obese accord to the recent house of lords report over fifth of child be overweight or obese before they even start school and by the time they leave school that number have double as child doctor have see child with significant medical complication from obesity include child of who weigh over kg and child of nine who weigh over kg as the hon member for stroud dr opher say doctor and other clinician have responsibility to let people know of the harm of obesity but they do not always do so that be partly because of time constraint and because there be not necessarily clear path to point the individual towards such message can also be receive with hostility which be another deterrent as hon member have say obesity lead to health problem the excess body fat disrupt the normal bodily function amplify the risk of heart disease diabetes cancer and arthritis while weaken the body ability to fight infection during the pandemic an obese person have high chance of die from than their peer of healthy weight the hon member for ilford south jas athwal speak of the human consequence an obese mother be more likely to suffer from complication during pregnancy she be more likely to miss out on important life event as the child grow up and when her grandchild be bear she will have low chance of be there to enjoy they what be cause this obesity at its most fundamental level overweight and obesity be the storage of fat as surplus energy energy consume as food that be extra to requirement but the reason may be more complex many hon member have discuss the lack of affordable food but they do not recognise or heed support for those grow our food and our fruit and veg instead this government have so far attack our farmer with high taxis during their lifetime and at death that will only increase the price of fruit and veg lincolnshire grow of the country vegetable but the labour government seek to carpet our beautiful farmland with mile and mile of solar panel reduce the area available for grow healthy fruit and veg increase import and price as my hon friend the member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth say time be key for family in which both parent be work find time to collect child prepare wholesome meal from scratch help with homework and get child to bed on time can lead to pressure to grab quick food or use packet sauce yougov survey from find that third of british people feel that they need recipe to produce food from scratch and one in six feel uncomfortable even with recipe so confidence in the kitchen need to be improve it be also worth remark that genetic play part as can medication and medical condition hormonal response to food restriction also play part so once someone have gain weight once it be not necessarily as easy as just say eat less have spend great deal of my time in parliament sit on the health and social care committee where the need for great focus on prevention be continually raise nowhere well be that illustrate than on the issue of obesity for example public health england laudable better health diet campaign that run from cost only of what the nhs spend on obesity and overweight treatment annually healthy eat begin with education people should know how to create healthy nutritious meal on budget as the hon member for blackpool south chris webb say appreciate the work do by the previous government to expand nutritional education in state school and would like to mention washingborough academy and its headteacher jason who have win award for locally produce healthy school food people also need to know what be in their food so they can make informed choice when they eat on the go the conservatives take action to display calorie information on menu so that people can make informed decision that can also influence portion size the previous government introduce the soft drink levy in and in we restrict promotion on food high in salt sugar and fat recent datum from the nhs health survey show that obesity rate among adult have stabilise over the past five year and the number of overweight or obese child be now at its low level since although note that those figure have continue to rise in scotland and wales let turn to advertising do advertising work of course it do if say the red car and the blue car have race be sure that member of similar age to would know which sweet that line advertise if ask they which sweet would be just enough to give your kid treat they would know exactly which one mean interruption the minister be nod as be you madam deputy speaker but be the problem the advert or be it what they be advertise be what they be advertise the same as or different from what they be advertise year ago at the moment the government approach to advertising seem little wrong headed their plan to restrict the advertising of junk food before pm paint with very broad brush and muesli porridge and rice cake be include under the ban however the nhs website say that porridge be healthy breakfast do the minister disagree with the nhs do the government intend to implement similar policy to that of transport for london under the mayor of london which allow the advertising of fry chicken burger but not of strawberry and cream the minister need to think carefully about what he want to promote as healthy and diet and then work from there before the general election the previous health secretary ask the national institute for health and care research to gather evidence on the impact of ultra process food on health have the government develop strategy to address the prevalence of ultra process food in our diet the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood mention that many such food contain artificial ingredient one of my concern be that ban or tax on high fat salt and sugar food cause reformulation but not necessarily to take sugar out and make an item less sweet for example it can be to add sweetener and other chemical substitute that may also trigger addictive eat behaviour that may be more harmful and retain the sweetness so it do not change people need for that sort of food member have mention the prospect of new pharmaceutical such as ozempic in tackle obesity the government have express an interest in explore that far and we welcome the new partnership with life science company to consider the potential of pharmaceutical in tackle some of the challenge face the country my right hon friend the member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke talk powerfully of his use of wegovy to lose stone and congratulate he on his success in do so one important point that he make about that class of drug be that they be not by themselves silver bullet they require willpower and people need to work with not against they as he say they be not without potentially severe side effect and as they might only work when an individual be use they they may require lifelong use we need judicious use of intervention with pharmaceutical combine with the necessary education and lifestyle change for weight loss to be sustainable in the long term this debate have focus on the issue of nanny state versus the freedom to choose this be labour government so of course they be very keen for widespread state intervention but what we need be not list of ban and taxis but coherent policy base on clear understanding of what they mean by healthy diet strategy for food security that include more home grow food education on diet and cooking the removal of the stigma associate with be overweight or obese which many member mention the avoidance of ban and taxis lead to reformulation with additive and processing and as obesity be such difficult condition to reverse the judicious use of medication most importantly prevention be well than cure so let we focus on the child be grateful to the backbench business committee for ensure that this debate take place and be particularly grateful to my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for secure it in the first place be also grateful to all member for their valuable contribution we have hear speech from across the house include from my hon friend the members for bolton south and walkden yasmin qureshi for chelsea and fulham ben coleman for ilford south jas athwal for swindon north will stone for liverpool west derby ian byrne for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson for worthe west dr cooper for southend east and rochford mr alaba for blackpool south chris webb for bathgate and linlithgow kirsteen sullivan for dudley sonia kumar for dartford jim dickson for mid cheshire andrew cooper and for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley on the opposition benches we hear from the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke who have to say look so healthy as consequence of the medication he be take remember what he look like before he be shadow of his former self we also hear from the hon member for newbury mr dillon for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth for caerfyrddin ann davies for honiton and sidmouth richard foord for lagan valley sorcha eastwood for strangford jim shannon and for stratford on avon manuela perteghella and then obviously from the opposition spokespeople for the liberal democrats and the official opposition the united kingdom have an obesity crisis it pose serious challenge to our health add preventable pressure on the nhs and restrict our economic productivity be reassure that none of we in the chamber today underestimate the scale or importance of the task ahead and we all recognise the need for action be proud that this labour government have already act on manifesto commitment in several key area as will outline but be also aware that much more need to be do over two third of adult be live with excess weight and around of child be live with obesity or be overweight by the time they leave primary school that be appalling but while it be shocking by itself that average hide the deep inequality we see in obesity child live in poor area be more than twice as likely to be live with obesity than those live in the least deprived area that have huge impact on our life increase the risk of many serious disease as we have hear as well as exacerbate mental health issue and reduce the year that we and our loved one can expect to live in good health almost of all working age people be economically inactive and much of that be due to long term health condition cause or exacerbate by obesity the cost of obesity relate condition to the nhs now stand at billion year and the cost to wide society be staggering billion every year be so proud that we be committed to raise the healthy generation of child ever that mean go far on prevention and tackle the driver of obesity over recent decade in the uk food and drink that be calorie dense nutrient poor and less healthy have become cheap it be vital that we ensure our policy continue to drive company to make food and drink healthier that be why this government take action to uprate the soft drink industry levy in the october budget that levy have already take thousand of tonne of sugar out of the drink we consume every day and give credit to george osborne the conservative chancellor in the coalition government who introduce that measure uprating the levy be key part of keep it effective and continue to drive reformulation towards healthy product however this be not just about what be in our food and drink less healthy food be more heavily promote market and advertise than ever before one third of the food industry advertising budget be spend on marketing confectionery snack dessert and soft drink while only around of that budget be spend on marketing fruit and vegetable it be therefore not surprise that our child want to eat those product one study estimate that of uk childhood obesity be attributable to junk food tv advertising that be why this government have already meet our manifesto commitment to lay the secondary legislation require to ensure the ban on junk food ad target our kid come in from october this year this include pm tv watershed for the advertising of less healthy food and drink product and restriction on pay for online advertising of all these product the minister be give very comprehensive response and it be much appreciated one of the thing ask for in my speech know he will do this but think we could probably do it well be to look at initiative in each of the region of scotland northern ireland or wales that could complement the policy drive from here be it the minister intention to do that with the regional administrations the advertising regulation of course cover the whole of the united kingdom but this labour government have good work relationship with the devolved government in northern ireland scotland and wales we have the intergovernmental ministerial meeting and we have be liaise closely on whole range of public health measure include the tobacco and vapes bill directly with ministerial counterpart in the devolved government want that relationship to deepen and mature because that be good governance across the whole united kingdom we know that our chance of access healthy food depend on where people live child live in less affluent area see five time more fast food outlet on their high street that be why it be so important that strengthen the new national planning policy framework local authority now have clear power to block fast food outlet near school and also where child and young people congregate to stop the relentless target of child and young people by the fast food industry make the healthy choice the easy choice be major part of achieve our shift to prevention we will continue to look at way to support people to make and sustain change in their diet in line with the government eatwell guide this may be good point at which to clarify our position on ultra process food there be concern association between ultra process food and negative health outcome include obesity however where the evidence be not yet clear be whether the negative health outcome be due to processing or to these product tend to be high in calorie sugar saturate fat and salt want to reassure hon member across the house that many ultra process food be already capture by the exist healthy eat advice policy action and regulation relate to hfss food our scientific advisory committee on nutrition continue to monitor the evidence on ultra process food and we will commission further research where need in my last few minute will turn to number of the issue that have be raise first just to reassure the shadow minister porridge oats will not be ban the majority of porridge muesli and granola product will not be affect by the restriction but some less healthy version with add sugar chocolate or syrup could be affect to be in scope product must fall within one of the category of food and drink set out in the schedule to the advertising regulation and be define as less healthy by the nutrient profiling model for example category include but be not limit to soft drink with add sugar savoury snack such as crisp breakfast cereal confectionery ice cream and pizza despite recent medium report the majority of porridge product will not be affect the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold make really important point about stigma and he be absolutely right that we really have to tackle stigma our genetic and our will power have not change in the last year what have change be the food environment and that we be bombard with marketing for unhealthy food we already know that the issue be even bad in some of the poor community finally my hon friend the member for chelsea and fulham and the hon member for caerfyrddin mention accessibility to healthy affordable food no child should live in poverty that be why our ministerial taskforce be explore all lever available across government to give child the good start in life we will tackle food insecurity by roll out free breakfast club in every primary school and continue to provide free healthy food during the holiday for child who receive free school meal it be really important that we continue with that there be no silver bullet for obesity this debate have show that obesity be not just about health it be about food tax education business employment advertising and more it be both national challenge and challenge within local community our health mission be focus on shift towards more preventive approach which will benefit this agenda in addition the department for environment food and rural affairs have announce an ambitious new cross government food strategy to work with the food industry to deliver on our goal for food security health affordability and the environment obesity be hugely complex challenge but tackle it be key part of achieve the change need in this country this government be commit to take effective action and look forward to update member on what we do next thank the minister and all who have speak because this have be genuinely interesting debate about an essential topic would just like to say in summary that the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth need to go into the supermarket when she be really busy and pick up tasty healthy snack if the government can get people do that it will be fantastic say to the minister that the house be behind he be radical it be not the time for non intervention thank all who have contribute miss supper and be starve so be go to go and have healthy snack hear hear question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the impact of food and diet on obesity business without debate finance committee motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that phil brickell be discharge from the finance committee and luke akehurst be dixon on behalf of the committee of selection question agree to crewe railway station motion make and question propose that this house do now elmore be grateful for the opportunity to address this house on an issue that be no strange to want to speak today to recognise the importance of crewe railway station not just to my constituent but to the entirety of cheshire east north west england and the nation as whole crewe station have be linchpin of the uk rail network it be one of the only train station in the country that provide connectivity that be unparalleled in its scope and criticality to the region the station have platform over million passenger pass through annually and more than train use the station each week it be incredible to look at the connection and destination we can travel to from crewe passenger can directly travel to manchester liverpool birmingham london cardiff glasgow edinburgh and countless other destination one destination that people can not currently get to from crewe be middlewich in my constituency middlewich be about eight and half mile from crewe and its population have increase by over the past year and now stand at around indeed it be the large town in cheshire without railway station do my hon friend agree that as network rail review and renew the infrastructure around crewe provision need to be make for additional capacity for future service include to middlewich completely agree with my hon friend who make strong case for his constituent in middlewich motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now elmore it be fair to say that the opportunity that open the station of middlewich would present to the country and to cheshire be exciting crewe station be genuine strategic asset for local and national infrastructure commend the hon gentleman for bring forward this debate do he not agree that to meet carbon target connectivity be essential and rail be need as an integrated part of that plan that as well as subsequent upgrade to exist station and frequent bus link to rail station all must be part of the net zero conversation it would not be an adjournment debate in this place without an intervention from the hon gentleman and he be correct will go on to say little more about the importance of rail to our climate objective the significance of crewe train station go beyond its enormous benefit to the rail network it provide and have provide in its lifetime critical economic benefit rise rise two at the same time will take my hon friend first my hon friend often share that wait at euston station wait for the screen to turn from blue to green when get on the train to crewe which also stop at atherstone in my constituency my constituent in north warwickshire and bedworth have have to bear the brunt of the work dig the tunnel through from birmingham to link to the north do he agree that link the network all the way to crewe be essential for open up economic prosperity to that area that will make the heartache worth while for my constituent my hon friend will not be surprised to hear that completely agree that connect phase of up to crewe be crucial if we be to see the real economic benefit of that project be grateful to the hon member for secure this adjournment debate and he be speak well on this important topic we be constituency neighbour and while crewe station be in his constituency it provide vital transport link and an important boost to the local economy for many people live in my constituency do he agree that crewe station be in urgent need of upgrade and that in the light of the cancellation of phase of assume that be happen we have an opportunity to improve exist infrastructure such as electrify the track between crewe and chester that would do so much to benefit my constituent and pave the way for the reopening of beeston and tarporley station thank the hon member for that intervention and for bring the opportunity to work on cross party basis across cheshire and the wide area to secure key benefit for our constituent she be absolutely right to say that electrification of the line from crewe to chester would be transformative it could deliver an additional billion in gross value add and create more than job over the next year those be crucial benefit have the pleasure of be the constituency neighbour of both my hon friend and the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth my hon friend have touch on the community who benefit from crewe station include those from madeley balterley and betley and many of my newcastle under lyme constituent use crewe on daily basis indeed when avanti choose to mess up its timetable have to go to crewe when be go home as my hon friend have touch on do he agree that rebuild trust will be really important many of my constituent in newcastle under lyme as in stoke on trent south have face the brunt of the failure of to date and many people have wait many year for compensation so as we look to have this conversation trust and restore trust must be at its heart thank my hon friend for that intervention he be absolutely right to point out some of the negative impact of the project on his constituent and indeed some of my constituent it be right that the government have take the necessary step to get the mismanagement of the project under control it be right that they continue to do that and fully engage with those negatively impact so far as my hon friend know stoke on trent sit on an offshoot of the west coast main line and provide vital east west link between crewe and derby which also require electrification do he agree that previous plan severely reduce service through staffordshire and stoke on trent and that any future development must not negatively impact this vital region for growth my hon friend make really important point that be why it be crucial that those of we who be impact by and the discussion around improve future rail infrastructure work together to get the good possible alternative plan on the table and be look at will make some progress within my constituency crewe station have strong tie to engineering and advanced manufacturing firm such bentley and alstom in crewe in the surround region many business exist because of the opportunity that crewe railway station provide enable supply chain and employment opportunity that would otherwise be out of reach and ensure the growth of local business crewe railway station serve as vital node along the west coast main line which connect london to the midland the north west and scotland approximately of all freight train that use the west coast main line pass through crewe again that be testament to the paramount nature of the station however while speak openly about the amazing thing that crewe station offer to transport connectivity and our economy across the country it be clear to both resident and expert that it face significant challenge the catchment area around crewe station be see rapid growth because of its connectivity to major economic centre in the uk my constituent in alsager holmes chapel sandbach and the surround village either drive directly to crewe or take train and transfer there do my hon friend agree that my constituent like his want more reliable journey through an improved station and moreover that well transport link could bring economic growth for passenger and other my hon friend be quite correct and do not let anybody tell hon member that secure the debate on narrow constituency interest the fact that crewe be such central hub for connectivity mean that well connection from crewe station mean well connection for people live in sandbach holmes chapel alsager and other since they be largely travel via crewe for major journey interruption indeed newcastle under lyme as well the challenge in term of crewe station be significant we see growth in population due to the station link to those major economic centre its platform be too few and too narrow to cope with project future demand on top of that the entrance have limited space and there be often leak in the roof which do not cover entire platform indeed we see an example of that on social medium just before christmas when one of the roof cave in and there be water pour through the ceiling which the staff have to collect in bucket crewe rightly boast of its position as rail hub but the condition of the station be ill befitting as front door to town with such rich rail heritage my hon friend be be extremely generous in give way he make an excellent point about the state of crewe station have speak to business leader who have be consider invest in cheshire but have be put off by the sheer dilapidation of the station do he agree that give that appear not to be come to crewe we must not wait to invest in the station and bring it up to century standard agree describe the station as the front door to crewe but it be also the shop window for investment due to the rail heritage in the town it be important that we use the station as an advert for job and investment across the town and the wide region whether or not ultimately come to crewe that will be an important issue the ability of crewe station to act as critical transport hub have be constrain by the challenge that have describe even network rail have identify the need to improve platform capacity and length to accommodate modern stock and address concern about accessibility and integration with other mode of transport the challenge that crew station face to function effectively also limit capacity on the west coast main line so its limitation have cascade effect on the entire rail network reduce reliability and increase journey time the plan for would have see crewe form central cog in phase connect high speed rail in birmingham to the wide network as key interchange projection suggest that do so could support the creation of job and provide billion to the regional economy in the short term not to mention the logistical benefit for rail operator it be no secret that my view be that the last government botch the job as they do in so many area that leave many community across the north of england perhaps none more so than the one be proud to represent demoralise and disillusion that they have be leave behind once again the last government decision have also mean that the modernisation of crewe station have be put on hold which raise even more question about its future it be not just crewe station but the rail infrastructure in our country that unfortunately be not up to standard that will only be exacerbate as time tick on without crucial investment be thankful to network rail alongside siemens for recently complete million overhaul of signal around the station over the christmas period for the benefit of the wide west coast main line however truly believe that there be need to go far should the government not commit to phase they should at least consider the many outstanding alternative that organisation have put forward and the position of crewe within those plan project such as growth track and the midlands north west rail link be two vital piece of work that recognise the need to invest in our railway for growth across the region and crewe feature as an integral part of both proposal invest in rail go beyond the economic benefit despite their substantial nature it be also about address the climate crisis get car and heavy good vehicle off the road and get modern electrify rail line to create transport system that be fit for the future in rail contribute of the uk total emission from transport but represent proportionately overwhelming of all passenger kilometre travel furthermore journey from london to glasgow by train use less than third of the kilogram of of petrol car and around sixth of the of the equivalent journey by aeroplane transport in total account for of all greenhouse gas emission the large contributor in our society and shift journey from road to rail can play crucial role in the government meet their climate target rail travel be one of the most sustainable form of transport by invest in crewe we can invest in the electrification of the line and green future for local transport thank the house for listen to my speech and for listen to sing the praise of my constituency rail heritage offer my apology for bend the minister ear on the subject once again but truly believe that transport particularly rail will be central part of any effort to boost economic growth in the north be certain that my constituency be ready and wait to play an active role in that firmly believe that crewe station be national treasure despite the short term constraint on public finance which be absolutely clear and which fully appreciate hope that minister see that too gently urge the government to recognise how critical this station could be for future infrastructure project and alternative to the northern leg of which can bring vast benefit to regional economic growth and improvement both to rail connectivity and to infrastructure the government must take decisive action to secure the future of rail in our country crewe station have be the beat heart of our rail network for almost year ask the minister to ensure that that remain the case congratulate my hon friend the member for crewe and nantwich connor naismith on secure this debate thank he for continue to raise the importance of crewe as railway station he never need to apologise for his advocacy he be right that crewe be and will remain vital component of the rail network after all it be the opening of the railway station in that lead crewe to develop from small settlement to the proud railway town that it be today my hon friend be clearly not alone today in recognise the importance of crewe railway station welcome contribution from range of hon member include my hon friend the members for mid cheshire andrew cooper for congleton mrs russell for stoke on trent south dr gardner for newcastle under lyme adam jogee and for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor and the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth not forget of course the hon member for strangford jim shannon as my hon friend set out and as other member have confirm crewe station be now crucial transport hub provide connectivity where four regional line converge with the west coast main line provide long distance link to london and scotland and the great city of the midland and the north as well as more local and regional link want to take moment to raise the issue around sandbach station there be no accessibility at the station which serve approximately people the only route to manchester for sandbach resident be to take train to crewe where they can change accessibly assume that everything be work and then take train back to manchester do the minister agree that this need address my hon friend be absolutely right to advocate for more accessible journey on the rail network because we want everyone to be able to travel on our railway be sure that my official will have hear those comment and will convey they to my noble friend lord hendy the rail minister as be sure he will want to look at that crewe location be strategically important to the railway thank to the connectivity that it provide for passenger freight and engineering service no other uk station be serve by more individual train operator with more than service on typical weekday there be just minute between the last train of the evening and the first of the following morning it be not surprising to hear that since its opening it have form critical part of the uk transport infrastructure and will no doubt continue to do so for future generation transport be an essential part of the government mission to rebuild britain for that reason we commit to improve rail connectivity across the midland and the north while work with devolved leader as we set out in our manifesto the previous government decision to cancel phase of be meet with huge disappointment by leader and community in crewe and frankly lot more widely as my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme highlight the previous government appalling mismanagement of have undermine trust in our ability to build new railway and perhaps in rail more broadly for the constituent of my hon friend the member for crewe and nantwich it mean the end of decade of effort to plan the benefit that the new high speed railway would have bring to the town now with the difficult position that this government have inherit our immediate focus be on the safe delivery of between birmingham and london at the low reasonable cost however while we have be clear that we can not reverse the previous government decision to cancel phase of we recognise concern about rail capacity and connectivity between birmingham and manchester we be consider range of potential solution that will have to be carefully balance with the very difficult fiscal context in which we be operate that could include optimise service deliver small scale infrastructure intervention or the proposal set out by the mayor of greater manchester and the mayor of the west midlands for new railway line between birmingham and manchester be very grateful to the minister for give way may urge she as she seek to consider option on capacity to ensure that there be real and meaningful engagement with the community that will be impact as mine in newcastle under lyme and those in many other part of north staffordshire have be without that real engagement the trust that we talk about early simply can not be build my hon friend be absolutely right that the work to engage local community be vital as we develop future transport plan commend my hon friend the member for crewe and nantwich for his passion in advocate for his constituency and ensure that any eventual decision take into account the role and need of crewe station which play such vital role on the west coast main line of course there be other constituency that we need to consider too those will certainly be on the government mind as we consider different option my colleague the rail minister have very constructive meeting with mayors at the end of last year he also meet my hon friend to discuss crewe role in the proposal do the minister agree that decisiveness be the key to deliver rail service at reasonable cost rather than the continual escalation in cost that be symptom of under the previous government do she also agree that in look at connectivity between london and manchester and increase capacity all the way along the west coast main line the time to act be now because there simply be not enough train to carry the passenger who need to travel in those direction my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the need for more capacity the west coast main line be particularly constrain what we know from the previous government approach be that constantly chop and change on project be precisely the way to lead to an escalation in cost and delay to delivery we do not want to repeat those mistake there be little that can share with the house at this stage about the future but can assure all hon member that we will continue to take their view and those of local leader into consideration as we develop our plan while we recognise the uncertainty that this period of review be cause local resident it be important that we take the necessary time not only to get this right but to learn lesson and ensure that there be no possibility of this government repeat the mistake that characterise the last government plan for major rail investment where they fail so miserably we be determine finally to deliver the benefit that local community expect assure all hon member that this government will not tolerate poor performance on our railway and that we will hold operator to account the minister be make an excellent speech while she be look at the future connectivity plan may make pitch that she should consider connectivity between stoke on trent and manchester airport we do not currently have direct service but business leader in staffordshire tell that it would be huge for our growth potential thank my hon friend for raise that point be sure that the rail minister will have hear he loud and clear and will consider the matter in the meantime while we consider the range of proposal that have be draw to my attention this evening there be clear need for intervention at crewe station to address age asset the government have provide network rail with billion for renewal operation and maintenance in england and wales for the period between and in turn network rail have develop programme of intervention to deliver essential renewal in the crewe area be pleased to assure hon member that this work will include replacement of the station roof and renewal of power system signal and track asset such as switch and crossing this be significant programme amount to over million which need to be re scope and re plan at pace to follow the last government decision to cancel phase of as the scope of the work develop we will collaborate with network rail to identify any opportunity for investment above and beyond essential renewal in parallel official in the department for transport be already work with cheshire east council on well integration between transport mode at crewe include road and rail reiterate that transport be an essential part of the government mission to rebuild britain crewe have play and will continue to play central role in our railway network we will continue to work with hon member local leader and the community that they represent to ensure that we get the delivery of infrastructure project right as have say welcome this debate because it be vital that we continue to discuss our transport project openly and transparently thank all hon member for their contribution this evening and for their continue contribution as we work to deliver the railway network that our country require question put and agree to house adjourn
