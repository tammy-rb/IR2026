of the leader of the opposition which will be move at the start of the debate and amendment in the name of stephen flynn and in the name of ed davey which will be move at the end of the debate call the shadow home secretary beg to move amendment at the end of the question to add but respectfully regret that the gracious speech do not commit to boost defence spending to of gdp by with fully fund plan fail to include measure that provide an adequate deterrent to migrant cross the channel illegally fail to mention rural community farming and fishing do not include legally bind target to enhance the uk food security or commitment to increase the uk wide agriculture budget by billion over the course of the parliament introduce new burden on business without sufficient measure to support they fail to set out concrete plan to tackle the unsustainable post covid rise in the welfare bill do not adequately protect family finance and the uk energy security in the move to net zero and fail to provide adequate protection for pensioner and work people to keep more of the money they have work hard for yesterday at the dispatch box welcome the home secretary to her role and now take the opportunity to congratulate the wide ministerial team who work with she they will have inherit hard work team of civil servant dedicate to the protection of this country and the people within it however be sad that the hon member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock have not make the transition from shadow immigration minister to immigration minister his contribution be great loss to the conservative party with the right hon member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson in her new ministerial role be sure the clerks of the home affairs committee will be look forward to arrange her first session promptly and will like be closely monitor how quickly her new boss fully implement all the recommendation of the committee she formerly chair while do not have time to mention each of the new ministerial team individually want to pay tribute to the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips she know plan to single she out and do not apologise for do so think that it be very good appointment and she be well suited to her role as parliamentary under secretary of state with responsibility for victim and safeguarding she know that tackle violence against woman and girl be priority for we have previously share the stage at event in the house discuss that subject genuinely look forward to work with she and contribute in any way can to her success in this incredibly important area of public policy she have highlight some of the crucial work that this place can do in bring to the attention of the country and the wide world the continue plight of too many woman the election highlight the important work of the home office in defend democracy pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for tonbridge tom tugendhat the former security minister for his work with the defend democracy taskforce again that be an area where we will seek to be constructive opposition be disgusted to see how the hon member for birmingham yardley and many other mostly female colleague and candidate be treat during the general election campaign no one who care for democracy irrespective of their party affiliation should be willing to tolerate that the defend democracy taskforce continue to have incredibly important and urgent work to do we should continue to work together as we do when our role be reverse to root out violence and intimidation and to ensure that candidate and member can vote with their conscience and campaign with their heart free from intimidation or threat while the prime minister have be enjoy his honeymoon period at nato and welcome visitor to the european political community event at blenheim palace which be very well organise by this government predecessor in the foreign commonwealth and development office the same honeymoon period have sadly not be afford to the home secretary member will all be familiar with the seven day of creation the new home secretary have manage seven day of destruction on day one she cancel the partnership with rwanda take away the deterrent that the national crime agency say we need in order to break the business model of people smuggle gang in do so on day two she create diplomatic row with rwanda whose ministers sadly have to read about the government decision in the british medium rather than receive direct communication from the government that be level of diplomatic indecency that will cast shadow over the relationship not just with that country but with many other on day three the home secretary announce an effective amnesty for ten of thousand of people who arrive here illegally we say that the incoming labour government would do that they promise that they would not yet that be exactly what they do on day four she start work on get back into the eu through the back door by negotiate to take more migrant from the continent on day five labour government minister go on national radio to advocate the relaxing of visa rule from the eu before be slap down for say the quiet bit out loud on day six home office figure release by the government show that the visa curb that put in place when become home secretary have cut migration by since last june she can thank for that later on the seventh day the home secretary probably try to get some rest but she will now know what have long know which be that as home secretary there be not the luxury of that day of rest therefore despite terrible first week of weather to bring in the new labour government we see almost asylum seeker arrive on small boat as of today will the right hon member give way the home secretary will be make speech in due course as say almost asylum seeker arrive in the first week and as of today more than asylum seeker have arrive in small boat since labour take office the second week at work be not much well will the shadow secretary of state give way the right hon member have the opportunity to speak in moment we have see riot in her back garden on the street of leeds and police officer clearly not confident that they will enjoy her support have to take backseat like so much of what be say ahead of this general election take back our street be clearly just labour slogan we then see neil basu very highly respected former police officer with whom work when be on the metropolitan police authority and general stuart skeates senior official at the home office with whom work in former life as well as when be home secretary rule themselves out of leadership of the new so call border security command they do so be sure because they know what we know which be that that be little more than fig leaf to hide the fact that the labour government be do less on migration and hop to achieve more the reality as everybody include the people smuggler know be that the small boat problem be only go to get bad under labour thank the shadow home secretary for give way it be shame to puncture his fantasy and bring he down to the real world in which he and his party treble net migration and leave we with the high level of spring boat crossing on record perhaps he can answer just one factual question he have spend million over two and half year run the rwanda scheme can he tell we how many asylum seeker he have send as say on the radio this morning if the right hon lady be go to pluck figure out of the air she should avoid nice round number because it be bit of giveaway she will know that we bring people into detention and that we have charter flight the fact that the new government scrap the scheme and with degree of diplomatic discourtesy do not labour members can groan from their benches but they will get use to the fact that we can not treat international partner in this way our relationship with rwanda be enter into in good faith by both party the rwandans discover that the incoming government be tear up that bilateral relationship in the page of the british medium the home secretary should learn that her new foreign secretary should have have the diplomatic courtesy at least to pick up the phone to his opposite number in rwanda to explain what be go to happen before they read about it in the british press she and both know that her government would not have act with that level of vile discourtesy have that partner be european country interruption labour member can groan all they like but we all know that be true the simple fact of the matter be that the new border security command replicate in all respect the work of the small boat operational command it take almost the whole general election campaign before the right hon lady attempt to clarify the role we still have very little clarity on the division of labour between the so call new border security command and the small boat operational command yesterday at the dispatch box she try to imply that there have be no return under the conservative government but let put some fact and figure on the record last year we return more than people to their home country include almost foreign national offender in order to keep ourselves safe foreign national offender for whom would remind the house her prime minister in his former guise fight tooth and nail to prevent be deport voluntary and enforce return be both up by more than two third at their high level for five year operation do by our immigration enforcement official which sound lot like return unit to be not sure what the right hon lady be do while in opposition but she might be surprised to learn that we be indeed smash the gang and we be make sure that people be arrest and incarcerate last year we smash almost criminal gang through our law enforcement agency remind the house that labour members vote against the nationality and borders act which be the legislation that we have be use to incarcerate those people smuggler they vote against that legislation labour in government be now so worried about their continue reputation for be and for look weak on immigration that they feel the need to announce raft of thing to sound tough which basically already exist they announce the border security command even though there be already small boat operational command they announce return unit even though immigration enforcement already do that what will they announce next what will they invent the raf look forward to see what function be to be replicate we will look at legislation when it come forward but as have discuss the government already have the tool they need and as long as they do not undermine their own effort by scrap more thing we might see an opportunity for they to reduce number in large part because we pass the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act the right hon lady have tool at her disposal on legal migration remember come to the government dispatch box in december last year and present to the house series of visa curb to cut net migration with our measure people who come here last year would no long have the right to come reduce migration by record amount already the data be show that because of the action take as home secretary visa application be down by compare with june last on the current trajectory net migration be set to halve in the next month thank to the action that take action oppose by the labour party at the time the labour manifesto say that net migration would come down but not by how much as say the first of that reduction be because of action take perhaps in her speech the right hon lady can confirm how much far than that she envisage bring net migration down labour talk tough ahead of the election about clamp down on employer bring in foreign worker but those plan have apparently now be shelve as we see nothing of they in the king speech and have not hear anything more about they on policing and crime be delighted to have my hon friend the member for stockton west matt vickers as shadow minister for policing fire and crime there be many brilliant thing about stockton place have visit and enjoy and he be of course one of those wonderful thing welcome the plan set out in the king speech for crime and police bill to tackle issue such as antisocial behaviour retail crime and knife crime and to drive up standard in the police force of course welcome they because those be issue that put forward when be home secretary the government can therefore count on our general support for these measure if they bring forward detailed proposal that properly address the issue really hope that the right hon lady have more success than have get her colleague the mayor of london to focus on bring down violent crime in our capital city we will of course scrutinise the legislation alongside the victim court and public protection bill over the previous parliament it be the conservative party that put new police officer on the street at the election we promise to hire an additional full time fully warrant police officer to protect our neighbourhood during the general election campaign the labour party make no such commitment limit their aspiration to only full time fully warrant officer hope that they will match our commitment to the shadow secretary of state should also remember that the labour party oppose our measure for bring in extra police and during the general election campaign it commit to have extra neighbourhood officer which many police and crime commissioner have say can not be fund because they be not clear how they be to be fund be it not the case that the conservative party have track record of deliver on more policing and the government have no idea whatsoever be very proud of the fact that in many part of the country include my county of essex there be now more warrant police officer than at any time in the force history in sharp contrast to labour run london where the conservative government put money on the table to recruit extra metropolitan police officer and the labour mayor of london have spectacularly fail to recruit those officer have not back officer when they say they need to do more stop and search and have see knife crime accelerate distort the whole national picture really hope that the right hon lady take this seriously she can chuckle all she like but this be about kid get stab on the street of london and she should take this more seriously interruption she should recognise that we introduce tough sentence under the public order act to clamp down on disruptive protest the benefit of which we have already see this week with the jailing of just stop oil protester in addition to plan to grant the police furth power to clamp down on protest that go too far and disrupt the life of people around this country the shadow home secretary know he should not make such disgraceful unfounded allegation about my response to knife crime he know that have meet family right across the country who be devastate by knife crime include in town and small community and suburb where this terrible crime be go up his party when in government repeatedly fail to ban serious weapon on our street will he now support this party and this government when we bring in the ban on ninja sword and dangerous machete that he should have bring in long ago make the observation that while be talk about young people get stab the right hon lady be chat and chuckle with her colleague on the front bench that be statement of fact the point be that we have get grip of crime but in the part of the country control by labour police and crime commissioner include london that be sadly not the case have lot of respect for the right hon gentleman but he will know from his tenure as home secretary that those sort of crime stabbing and shooting be happen all across the country and not just in city they be happen in town such as warwick and leamington where we have have someone shoot dead through drug dealing many people stab maliciously and some kill the reality be that under his watch over the last year we have see degradation of the number of police officer on our street and rise knife crime do he not accept that the figure speak for themselves people will be able to see the level of crime include violent crime in conservative run part of the country and compare they with those in labour run part of the country the figure be in the public domain anyone can check they unfortunately it appear that the government have not see fit to lay out their plan to address the issue of violent aggressive intimidatory or disruptive protest for the safety of our street and for the confidence of the officer who need to police protest hope that the government do the right thing and change that vacuum where policy should be under conservative leadership we announce raft of change to support victim of domestic abuse put more abuser under management of the police and under increasingly strict arrangement by designate violence against woman and girl as national policing priority national threat on par with the threat of terrorism as have say the home secretary and her front bench colleague should know that will always give my wholehearte support to action they take to protect woman and girl we have make improvement through operation soteria change the way the investigatory system operate to ensure that victim of rape and serious sexual assault can get justice and provide specialist training for officer we be commit to ensure that rape victim feel confident to come forward to report because we know the sad truth that even with the good work of operation soteria far too few people come forward we want to encourage they to do so and we will support the government in any action they take in this area thank the shadow home secretary for give way on that important point he will recognise that one issue we have all campaign on be the fact that many of those woman do not come forward because they have no trust in the police key issue we have be work on be get senior officer to suspend those police officer who be find guilty of wrongdoing do he agree that we need to make sure that that work now so that those woman can have the confidence to come forward include where those allegation be against other police officer the hon lady be absolutely right although it do not make its way through all its parliamentary stage the proposal that we put in the criminal justice bill strengthen the accountability framework for officer and strengthen police leadership to take action again hope that the government will continue that incredibly important work and once again put on record my willingness to support they in ensure that the disciplinary practice within police give woman the confidence to come forward be it not true that the net number of police be low after year of tory government there have be net loss to policing do the shadow home secretary agree that the reason we have not hit our number in london for the met police be that we be in special measure and there need to be caution over the police who be recruit we need to ensure there be good police officer so it be about quality not just quantity disagree with the hon lady assessment of police number that do not accord with the figure that have see police number be up and we have plan to recruit even more get the party loyalty towards the mayor of london but the simple fact of the matter be that all police force have to ensure that there be vet procedure in place the vetting procedure for the metropolitan police be no more onerous than for other force around the country yet many other police force include my own have record number of police officer the metropolitan police be the well fund police force per capita in the country and yet with all the freedom that the mayor of london have and with all the money that be put on the table he have fail to recruit the police officer that the capital city need that have an impact not just on people who live and work in london but on visitor and people who travel through it in constantly evolve criminal landscape we deliver the online fraud charter it be world first agreement with of the big tech company as signatory proactively to block and remove fraudulent content from their platform facebook instagram and amazon be among those key signatory we introduce the national security act and the economic crime and corporate transparency act and we proscribe hizb ut tahrir terrorgram and the wagner group to make promotion and membership of those organisation illegal to conclude the right hon lady have tough job home secretary will always be tough job however during our time in government we ensure that she have more police officer at her disposal an effective small boat operational command an effective immigration enforcement command and suite of legislation to allow she to match the rhetoric of the campaign to her action in government the home secretary have inherit fall meet migration figure grow economy and large parliamentary majority to ensure she get her business through the house while we will be critical when the government make mistake and will seek to ensure that they do the right thing we all have desire for her department to succeed and indeed an interest in its do so on that point wish she the very good of luck welcome everybody to the final day of the king speech debate also welcome the shadow home secretary word about the excellent ministerial team that we now have in the home office and his continued support for the defend democracy taskforce which know he and his shadow security minister the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat take immensely seriously when they be in government can tell the house that we will be meet later this week our first meeting after the election to review some of the issue that know have affect member right across the country we be extremely serious about what happen during the election and how we all need to respond and to stand up for our democracy to listen to the shadow home secretary no one would think he have just spectacularly lose general election apparently under the conservative we have just all have it so good for such long period of time however be glad to see he enjoy opposition so much long may it continue this may be the final day of the king speech debate but of course it be only the beginning of the tory leadership husting the shadow home secretary name be on the list and we look forward to his launch maybe late this week it be very exciting as someone who have unsuccessfully stand for their party leadership in the past do have some sympathy with his predicament it be not just that he be only the bookie fifth favourite he be not even the lead candidate from essex or even the lead candidate from his shadow home office team have some bad news for both the shadow home secretary and the shadow security minister the right hon member for tonbridge their chance have be deal hammer blow by that strategic brain and deputy leader of the conservative party the right hon member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden who be elect at the same time as they in when ask who the star of his generation be he say there only two people from my generation that could see lead the conservative party rishi sunak or vicky atkins how disappointing be that discount by the great election guru of the conservative party before they have even start rise will give way on that subject just for expectation management may ask when the home secretary will start talk about her portfolio the shadow home secretary spend his entire speech not talk about any of the challenge that the country face but simply play to the conservative back benches with fantasy leadership application speech what be it about these former home secretaries and ministers apparently of the last seven home office ministers in cabinet six of they be run we have the previous home secretary the home secretary before that and the home secretary but one before that the same person strangely because never forget it be possible to be sack from the same job twice plus the home secretary before that the former security minister and the former immigration minister they have quite record between they they have treble net migration let boat crossing hit record high this spring decimate neighbourhood police there be few neighbourhood police and police community support officer on our street let record number of crime go unsolved bust the home office budget by billion and yes spend million send just four volunteer to rwanda if they be now line up to do to the tory party what they have already do to the home office and the country well frankly they deserve each other every one of they champion that policy on rwanda although the shadow home secretary to be fair to he do notoriously describe it as batshit crazy well maybe that be what someone need to be to stand for tory leader right now interruption we have hear that the conservatives be go to run this contest until november we have five oh do the shadow home secretary want to deny have ever describe the rwanda programme and development partnership as batshit will give way to he if he would like to respond if the right hon lady can say when where and to whom that be say carry on the right hon gentleman be the one who say it so he be the one who will know if he want to deny that he ever say it will not say it again honestly but think that he protest little too much with this sort of wriggling he would not do very well under interrogation we have hear today that the leadership contest will run until november we have five month of this there be hardly any tory mps here because they be all off do their little chat and meeting it be like cross between love island and the jungle rob and suella have break up and now john have go off with kemi everyone be look over their shoulder for snake and rat apparently somebody have have nervous breakdown and that be probably all of their back benchers dread get little text say that another candidate want chat we can see it look at they all they be all say be tory mp get out of here that be exactly what our labour mp have just do they have get lot of tory mp out of here because the country be cry out for change for what the prime minister have describe as decade of national renewal on our economy our public service and our relationship with the world and in politic itself by bring politic back into public service again say to all hon member on my side and on the opposition benches that will work with everyone to restore britain sense of security public safety on our street secure border and confidence in our police and criminal justice system yes will repeatedly challenge the conservatives on the legacy that they have leave we because the damage be serious and think that they have be hugely reckless with the safety of our country yes the approach and value of our party may be different but think that there be important area where we should be able to come together to bring change in the interest of our country our community and our security because that be what public service mean that be what this labour government be determined to do we have set out in the king speech three home office bills on crime and policing border and asylum and security will cover each issue in turn start with safety on our street and confidence in the police and the criminal justice system everyone will have fresh in their mind the concern raise by constituent during the election campaign fear that at time when we have few neighbourhood police and pcso confidence in policing have drop street crime and knife crime be surge in town and suburb not just in our city and shoplifting have become an epidemic those be the kind of crime that really affect how people live in their own community yet too little be be do congratulate the right hon lady on her new position before the election be call we have succeed in cross party campaign to make cuckoo criminal offence in the criminal justice bill which then sadly fall notice that in the crime and police bill there be no mention at all of cuckooing do she support the idea of make cuckooing use the home of the most vulnerable in society for criminal behaviour criminal offence if so will she commit to introduce that process again she would have my support and can guarantee that she would have the support of the previous government because tell they so at the time over to she the right hon member raise an immensely important point which we support be happy to talk to he far or he can talk to the minister with responsibility for victim and safeguarding my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips series of issue include in the criminal justice bill which fall when the election be call have cross party support and need to be take forward congratulate the right hon lady on her appointment one issue that be agree on cross party basis be the campaign that we lead on abolish the vagrancy act we conclude that that change would be beneficial for homeless people because they would no long face arrest and would be provide with assistance will she commit on behalf of the government to introduce that change as part of the legislation the hon member make an important point there be lot of cross party agreement there be also area where the last government attempt to respond end up provoke lot of disagreement and where we have different view suggest that he discuss the detail far with the new home office ministers because we take the matter seriously but want to ensure that we get it right and do not make the error that the previous government make in the detail of their response as well as the issue around community and town centre crime we have have an important report from the police today warn that violence against woman and girl be national emergency that have not be take seriously for far too long we have record crime go unsolved the criminal justice system and prison be be push into crisis too many people have the feeling that nothing be do and no one will come we can not go on like that for we in the labour party this be root in our value security be the bedrock of opportunity family can not prosper and get on in life if they do not feel safe community can not be strong if they do not feel secure nation can not thrive if it be under threat respect for each other and the rule of law underpin who we be as country they be how we sustain our democracy and our sense of justice and fairness too often those thing have feel undermined that be why we have make safe street one of the five central mission of this labour government mission to restore and rebuild neighbourhood policing to restore trust and confidence in police and the criminal justice system and to deliver our unprecedented ambition of halve serious violence within decade that be hugely ambitious mission halve serious violence mean halve knife crime and violence against woman and girl over the next year know that will be extremely difficult but ask everyone to be part of it because it be so important and we should all be try to keep people safe welcome the home secretary to her place and know that she have campaign on this really important area for many year she talk about all of we be involve in this mission do she agree that the people who be work with these community on the ground youth worker independent domestic violence advocate doctor in unit school employee and teacher all need to be involve in this conversation many of those people see what be happen before the authority do and it be vital that they be part of this national conversation my hon friend be exactly right this have to be mission for all of we it be not just about what the home office do although we want the home office to do so much more in this area it be not just about what the government do it have to be about all of we it have to be about recognise that for generation after generation people have just shrug their shoulder about unacceptable violence against woman and girl it have just be see as normal just one of those thing that happen when actually we should not stand for it this be an opportunity for change and to bring everyone together to make that change my hon friend be absolutely right that those who be on the frontline see that violence in practice be often also those who know what need to be do as part of the new crime and police bill we will bring forward measure to tackle violence against woman and girl that include make sure that we have specialist rape and sexual assault unit in every police force and specialist domestic abuse expert in control room recognise the terrible tragedy of what happen to raneem oudeh and how devastating it be she call four time on the night she be kill and no one come for she and her family we have to make sure that we make change we have to get neighbourhood police back on the beat so we will introduce new neighbourhood policing guarantee and new arrangement to cut waste compelling force to change the way they procure in order to make the saving we need saving that we will put back on the frontline thank the home secretary for her speech and for all the possibility she have put forward which we will hopefully endorse later today when the vote come as the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi mention an attitude change need to happen in society and it be important that the medium promote it in positive way there have be think murder of woman and girl across northern ireland over the past few year that concern greatly so when the home secretary bring forward the idea she be describe in the form of legislation in this house will she share those policy and legislative change with the northern ireland assembly what she have describe today can be beneficial for all of we in this united kingdom and in particular for northern ireland it be really important that my constituent and lady and girl across northern ireland feel safe and at the moment they do not the hon member make really important point this be about all of we and northern ireland have some of the high level of domestic abuse murder this issue be immensely serious and the safeguarding minister be already plan to have those discussion because we should all be learn from each other about what it take to save life and keep people safe we will bring in new power on antisocial behaviour include new respect order and new action on off road bike which be dangerous and deafening and be be use to terrorise some community we will also take action against the soar shoplifting that have see supermarket chain butter cheese and fabric conditioner to the shelf reverse the previous conservative policy on low value theft and we will stand up against the appalling violence against shop worker for year the co op the union of shop distributive and allied workers major retailer small shop owner and shop worker across the country have urge we to strengthen the law against assault on shop worker and through this king speech we will do so we will also increase standard in policing include through mandatory vetting standard across force and improvement around misconduct on the topic of mandatory vetting do my right hon friend agree that we should also have psychological testing for the police some of the incident that have be bring to light such as the kidnapping and killing of sarah everard and the picture take of bibaa and nicole in brent be appal and can only be do by people who have lose compassion in their job my hon friend make an important point some of this be about the vetting standard before people be appoint as police officer but some of it be about the culture that can operate within force or small group within force that always need to be challenge include by leadership we want to see national vetting standard let we be clear there be police officer who do an incredible job every day of the week to keep we all safe while also show immense bravery for year run have be to the police bravery award to hear incredible story of heroism but those brave officer be badly let down just as community be badly let down when other officer fail to meet those standard or when they abuse the power they have that be why the standard and safeguard issue be so important turn to knife crime no parent should have to lie in bed worry that son or daughter might not come home one of the hard thing be to talk to parent who be grieve who stand with photo in frame because that be all they have it be important that all our community take action to prevent our young people from be drag into crime and violence the king speech mean new law to get dangerous knife off the street such as ninja sword of the type that be use to kill year old ronan kanda near his home in wolverhampton two year ago pay tribute to the tireless campaigning of pooja ronan mother we will also set up radical new young futures prevention programme to stop our teenager be draw into life of violent crime bring service together around young people in the way that the last labour government sure start programme do for our young child it will be programme for teenager to help they get back on track we will also bring forward new legislation on border security and immigration legal migration have treble in the past five year the big driver have be overseas recruitment with work visa soar because the last government run what be effectively free market laissez faire approach to both the economy and the immigration system they completely fail to tackle skill shortage area such as engineering have be on the shortage list for decade if not generation never have proper programme we have see the number of engineering visa go up while the number of engineering apprenticeship have go down we have to turn that around which be why as well as continue with visa control we will draw up new arrangement to link the point base system with new skill plan that be why the education secretary have draw up plan for skills england will the home secretary give way will give way one more time to the hon member one of the issue we have be pursue over the past few year have be the fishing visa scheme to bring crew in the last government bring suggestion forward but they put very high ceiling on wage mean it be impossible for some of the crew in the fishing boat to bring people in under the visa scheme will the home secretary meet and other interested party in this chamber who represent fishing community to discuss way forward believe there be way of do it and very much look forward to work with the home secretary to ensure that that be possibility and that we have future be sure the hon member will continue to raise issue in this chamber until every minister have meet he on one issue or another and be sure all of our home office ministers will be willing to do so let turn to the issue of asylum policy many of which we discuss yesterday have highlight they and will continue to do so because be still frankly shock about the amount of money that be spend we have hear lot about tough action on asylum seeker and tough action on immigration what the home secretary have not talk about in her statement yesterday and her speech today be the value of immigration how it assist our economy and how it enrich some of our community can we hear some more about that from the home secretary because surely we be not go to replace one tory hostile environment with new labour hostile environment let we be clear immigration be important to our country and have be through the generation with people come to this country to start some of our big business or to work in public service but it also need to be properly control and manage so that the system be fair and so that rule be properly respect and enforce the issue of illegal migration trebling over the last five year have think reflect some fundamental failure around skill and fundamental failure around the way the economy work it be important that those be address and that we do not just shrug our shoulder and turn our back we believe in have properly control and manage system and that be the right way to deal with this similarly turn to asylum it have always be the case that this country have do its bit to help those flee persecution and conflict and we must continue to do so but we must also have properly manage and control system we raise yesterday the shocking scale of the million spend send four volunteer just four volunteer to rwanda the decision on the asylum hotel amnesty that the conservatives have in effect be operate be actually even bad and have cost even more money know that the shadow home secretary have say that he do not recognise those figure but wonder if he actually ever ask for they would say to he that it be one of the first thing ask for because be sick and tired of see government just waste money with careless policy when they have never actually work out how much they be go to cost the conservatives policy under the illegal migration act with the combination of section and be to have everybody enter the asylum hotel system or the asylum accommodation system and never to take any decision on those case there be shocking cost to the taxpayer of up to billion over the next few year on asylum accommodation and support it also mean that the rule just be not be respect and enforce it be deeply damaging and undermine the credibility of the asylum system but it also leave the taxpayer pay the price yes the king speech do bring forward new legislation on border asylum and immigration that will include bring forward new counter terror power include enhanced search power and aggressive financial order for organise immigration crime and we be recruit new cross border police officer investigator and prosecutor as well as new border commander this be part of major upgrade in law enforcement work with cross border police station across europe to be able to tackle disrupt and dismantle the action of criminal gang before they reach the french coast finally let turn to national security because when it come to defend our nation against extremist and terrorist against state challenge and hostile threat or against those who try to undermine our democracy and value hope this house will always be ready to come together pay tribute to the police and the intelligence and security service which work unseen to keep we safe in that spirit hope the whole house will be ready to support martyn law draw up by the tireless figen murray in memory of her son martyn hett so that we learn the lesson from the terrible manchester attack when child and their parent who go out for special night never come home and life could have be save that hope be the moment to end on because we will debate argue and have difference of view but in this house at the very heart of our democracy we can also come together to keep community safe call the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome the home secretary to her place and congratulate she on what hope will be new era in home affair in this country thank she for her declare openness to work together across the house in the good interest of everyone have to say that have have one small disappointment in that have anticipate we would not argue about the rwanda scheme today for too long it seem we have have to listen to the empty rhetoric about fail immigration and asylum system and the botched attempt to fix it today we should be look forward with more of sense of anticipation it be like the day someone get their exam result and choose their university with the anticipation of the choice the positive choice they will make in the future could we be enter period of more positive attitude towards immigration as well as fix the asylum backlog have more community police and as the home secretary mention have continue focus on tackle violence against woman and girl today report estimate that one in woman in england and wales will be victim of male violence every year that be shocking the domestic abuse act be important in move we forwards but there be more to do and welcome the comment of the home secretary on work together while have confidence in the new government determination to tackle violence against woman and girl urge they to continue with the same cross party approach that as mention prove so successful with the domestic abuse act work together on that be key and it can be again on the crime and police bill and the victim court and public protection bill specifically the domestic abuse commissioner nicole jacobs have be clear that we really need to see full ratification of the istanbul convention and new mandatory training for police on support the victim of violence against woman and girl be sure everyone here agree with the sentiment that all of we deserve to feel safe in our own home and community that provide the security and the stability from which people can live their good life and create the good community yet for too many people in the uk in the past decade that have simply not be the reality unnecessary cut and the ineffective use of resource have contribute to the rise in unsolved crime as police force have be leave overstretched and under resource serious violence have destroy too many young life our community be plague by burglary fraud and antisocial behaviour and far too many criminal be get away with it as say violence against woman and girl remain horrifically high on top of that the huge backlog in the court be deny victim the justice they deserve prison be in crisis overcrowded understaffed and fail to rehabilitate offender we need to free up local officer time to focus on their community and we on the liberal democrat benches will continue to call for return to proper community police however we also need to look at how we be work with our neighbour to tackle international crime it will come as no surprise that hope this government will work to repair some of the damage do to that co operation by the previous government attitude to europe as well as to build well relationship with europe and improve co operation with our neighbour on tackle cross border crime human trafficking the illegal drug trade cyber crime and terrorism we need to recognise the golden thread that run through departments and that success will be much more likely if we do not work in silos as the home secretary say we need to invest in youth service that be genuinely engage what this all come down to be prevention and early intervention to improve life and make our community safe if could beg your indulgence mr deputy speaker would like to make something of personal plea to the government in the last parliament introduce private member bill motivate by my own experience and my family experience of lose parent too young work closely with lead charity such as winston wish which provide bespoke counselling group session and online service to help young people deal with their grief be delighted to see the child wellbee bill and its recognition of the need for well bereavement support would hope when we see the detail that it will provide clear guidance for local council school and other public body on how to ensure that every bereaved child know where to find the right help for they when they need it so that their life be not blight and they do not go into adulthood carry the burden of that grief there be one other issue would highlight live in and represent part of edinburgh diverse city which at this time of the year be prepare for massive influx of performer and audience from across the world it be fun and it be entertaining but more than that it be vital event that bring more than million into the local economy every year it be part of our creative industry which be worth billion to the uk economy every year they have suffer as much perhaps more than many other sector from the chaotic and ineffective immigration and visa system we have have in this country for the past decade make no mistake we need to improve it but we need to improve it for our economy and for our nhs generation of people from all over the world have greatly enrich our economy our culture and our community and as liberal my party and would like to see people treat as just that people who come here and benefit our country but our immigration system have be break by the conservatives damaging rule mean british employer can not recruit the people they need and family be separate by unfair complex visa requirement in my constituency of edinburgh west have sit with family tear apart by these rule and do my good to reunite they the dysfunction in the system have make the asylum backlog soar and public confidence in the system be shatter the home office have not be fit for purpose and hope this government policy as set out in the king speech will address that it need to put people at its heart with safe and legal route to sanctuary and it can not be state how pleased be that the unworkable rwanda plan have be scrap but we must smash the criminal gang at the root of the people traffic that be cause so much distress welcome what the government have announce so far but we do need more and those safe and legal route mention be surely the good way to take power away from the gang along with that we need to expand and properly fund the uk resettlement scheme the hon member will know from be scottish mp and the work of the scottish affairs committee that we face press demographic issue in scotland we be the only part of the uk that will have fall population in year time will she support the emerge cross party talk about specific and distinct scottish visa so we can finally get on top of our demographic and population issue the hon gentleman know that believe we should be look at the sector that suffer the fruit production and pick sector and the food processing sector in scotland need workforce and need immigration as much as those sector in the rest of the united kingdom we should not look at specific geographical area we should be look at sector we should be look at industry and what benefit the whole of the economy of the whole of the united kingdom have mention the uk resettlement scheme but we also need clarity on whether the illegal migration act and the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act will be repeal and consign to history as the expensive mistake we surely recognise they as this government have much to do and where we can we will support and work with they later today we will be propose an amendment detail the area we would like to see strengthen uphold public standard address the crisis in our health system have cross party commission on social care and scrap the two child benefit cap on those area where we can work with this government we will do so what they have set out be only beginning however and we look forward to see the detail of the legislation rise order unfortunately there will have to be an eight minute limit on back bench speech although those make maiden speech be exempt from that call debbie abrahams thank you very much mr deputy speaker it be surprise to be call so early but be absolutely delighted welcome the king speech and its focus on fairness and opportunity for all quite the antidote to the last year when thing have be anything but fair the uk now have the high level of income inequality in europe and the ninth high of oecd country inequality in wealth be even bad with the top fifth of the population have over one third of the country income but two third of the country wealth these inequality in income and wealth be particularly concentrated in the north but also among disabled people and ethnic minority community the impact of these inequality on health have be describe by professor sir micheal marmot in his late report live cut short he write in the bmj if everyone have the good health of the least deprive of the population there would have be million few death in england in the period to poverty and inequality be not inevitable they be the result of political choice the choice of consecutive conservative governments over the past year have lead to not only our flatline economy but our flatline life expectancy and healthy life expectancy in deprive area such as mine life expectancy and healthy life expectancy be actually decline we also have grow level of economic inactivity due to this ill health and the international monetary fund have reveal that there be causal impact from these health inequality on economic growth for every increase in the income share of the rich growth be reduce whereas increase the income share of the poor increase growth ensure vibrant stable and fair economy with sustainable growth will enable we to renew and restore our overstretch public service with fair funding formula and public spending allocation base on need there be an opportunity to improve health in area such as oldham that have fall behind there be many bills and initiative that will make positive difference to our life and living standard and these include the new deal for work people that will make work pay end the outrage of over million work people live in poverty and million child in poverty live in working household transform the life of million of people up and down the country include in oldham east and saddleworth the new gb energy company will not only support new quality job but provide cheap clean energy reduce the energy bill of my constituent and million of other the child wellbee bill with free breakfast club and extra nursery place will also help to reduce cost pressure for young family while make life bit easy for family our plan to enable million new quality home to be build while at the same time ensure legislation to end no fault eviction will be huge relief to tenant and mortgage holder everywhere collectively these measure will help improve the living standard of million of people but they will not happen overnight or for all people some million working age people be out of work because of an illness or disability while many sick and disabled people want to work and will benefit from the extra nhs appointment and therapy it will be many month before we see inroad into these waiting list similarly would like to think that the attitude of employer towards hire disabled worker will shift quickly but we recognise that be unlikely to be the case and then there be other disabled people for whom the possibility of working be unrealistic those who be disabled or who live in household with disabled adult or child be more likely to live in poverty over the past year disabled people have be absolutely batter by consecutive conservative government as the un committee on the rights of persons with disabilities describe there have be systematic violation of their right under the un convention my hon friend be make an excellent speech six year on that committee do follow up report which find that thing have in fact get even bad for disabled people so do she agree that it be now absolutely right that new labour government will change course my hon friend be absolutely right and be absolutely convinced that under labour government we will see these change think it be important that we put on the record where we be at the moment we need to ensure that the right to adequate social protection and social security be in place and we know that be not the case at the moment we must do well not just in change the culture of the department for work and pensions but in recognise the extra cost the fear and the poverty disabled people face and feel because otherwise fear that we will be see more death of disabled claimant similarly while support the measure in the king speech to improve our life that can not happen soon enough for the nearly one in two child live in poverty across oldham child live in poverty now will be affect by the experience for the rest of their life there be evidence that live in poverty change the wiring of their brain many will not reach their first birthday shamefully we have the bad infant mortality rate in northern europe there be no law of nature that decree that child from poor family have to die at more than twice the rate of child in rich family welcome that the secretaries of state for education and for work and pensions have establish the child poverty taskforce to deliver the cross government child poverty strategy and look forward to it report in the early autumn we can not forget the million child across the uk with special educational need send education be in crisis and that can not continue this labour government be government for everyone and the king speech be starting point on that look forward to work with the government to deliver the change that all our country need call andrew snowden to make

country nestle on stunning coastline with many town and village across the countryside each with their own history might add that it be also an area that we intend to fight to keep green and beautiful for generation to come fylde be far more than coastline countryside and be part of our county history some of the most advanced technology in the world be be develop and build here in fact often when out near warton and freckleton we can hear the jet fighter take off from the site where they be construct while be out on the election battlefield campaign every day it feel strangely reassuring to hear the incredible noise as the fighter jet power overhead to be honest need all the back up could get in the battle to keep fylde blue this time from the defence sector to farming and agriculture tourism and hospitality the care sector and other there be strong local economy however to build on that to create more opportunity for young people and to well connect our business and those seek opportunity across lancashire and beyond we need to improve infrastructure and public transport be grateful to the work that my predecessor as the member for fylde do to secure million in extra funding work with the government local council and other partner he be critical in secure the million that enable the to heyhouses link road to be construct and it have recently be open few month early the million windy harbour to skippool bypass open an important link road for the people across poulton le fylde the boundary review bring this historic market town of poulton in wyre to the constituency of fylde therefore also place on the record my thank to the former member for wyre and preston north and former defence secretary the right hon ben wallace and not only for the role he play in secure the funding for that major project but for his unwavering work as secretary of state for defence in such critical unpredictable and dangerous time the global leadership he demonstrate

reliability of service would also like to talk about an important personal area of work that will undertake as member of this house would not be here today would not have survive the journey to this moment without the support encouragement and love of my wife caroline we have be each other strength through good time and difficult one and the fact that caroline have always have the strength to support in such magnitude when she have have her own battle to fight be testament to the person she be caroline like thousand across this country live with what be often know as an invisible disability it mean that she have often conceal just how sick and in pain she be she have have to explain why she be in hospital when just week early she may have be visibly well to everyone and therefore suffer in silence want to champion the work of crohn colitis uk and other charity and organisation that support and advocate for those with disability that be not visible and to help remove the stigma indifference and even hostility that they receive for example when need to use facility mark as for disabled people the hurt and humiliation that can cause only add to the incredible difficulty of live with these condition and we must do much more to raise awareness to conclude fylde be place where some of the most advanced fighter jet in the world be build and it be at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and other technology but it be also place where town from lytham to kirkham and village from stain to singleton still crown the young rose queen each year and hold gala and parade and place where people take pride in look after the countryside and preserve our heritage intend to spend my time in this house fighting for fylde yes for the investment in our future but also the preservation of our history our coastline and our countryside first congratulate the hon member for fylde mr snowden on his maiden speech it be move speech and know that his family and his constituent will be very proud of his commitment to work on the issue around crohn and colitis which be devastating and difficult disease for those who have to endure it it be privilege for to represent the community of dulwich west norwood herne hill gipsy hill and part of brixton crystal palace camberwell and tulse hill and be grateful to everyone who vote to send here for fourth time be especially grateful to the resident of champion hill ward who vote for for the first time in this election due to boundary change be delighted to be speak for the first time from the government side of the house of commons over the past nine year in this place have see the impact of the conservatives political decision on my constituent have see the housing crisis deepen every single year our local school have struggle as the school funding formula be change to redirect funding away from constituency like mine with high level of deprivation to more affluent area of the country local authority funding have be decimate affect the ability of our local council to keep deliver the service that resident need our local health service have be place under unbearable pressure parent be pay more than their rent or mortgage for childcare place and our police be unable to fill essential role in neighbourhood policing there be not single part of our public sector that be not at least partially break after year of cut and neglect while every gracious speech that have listen to until now have make something else bad than it be before among the most egregious legacy of the past year of conservative government have be the impact on the life chance of child and young people seven hundred thousand more child be live in poverty than in there have be shocking decline in child and young people mental health we have see sure start centre close spiralling number of teenager enter the care system and parent across the country battle for special educational need and disability support so be deeply hearten to see that this gracious speech set out legislative programme that begin the process of renewal and restoration that our country need and that will start to improve the life chance of child and young people legislation will increase the number of teacher in our school improve the mental health and wellbeing of young people ensure that no child in primary school have to start the school day hungry increase the number of nursery place and deliver well support for young people who be at risk of serious violence welcome the establishment of the child poverty taskforce child poverty be scourge on our society the increase over the past year be shameful and it must be core drive mission of the government to eradicate it child poverty do not happen in isolation child live in poverty because their parent be poor the solution to poverty be multiple and include make work pay more genuinely affordable housing reduce energy bill and create social security system that actually act as an effective safety net understand the need both for comprehensive strategy for tackle child poverty and for all public spending decision to be fully fund and affordable but two thing be important first the child poverty taskforce must work with urgency and speed and it must result in concrete action soon childhood be short and the year that be blight by poverty can not be rerun secondly the taskforce and the government must follow the evidence that include evidence from the institute for fiscal studies the trussell trust and wide range of expert show clear correlation between the two child cap on child benefit and increase child poverty as well as the alleviation that would come from lift it hope that the government will consider that evidence as part of wide comprehensive strategy several wide challenge affect child and young people be not include in the king speech but will require imminent strategic decision making from our new government they include the crisis in send support and the safety valve programme which be force many council to make impossible cut to service that vulnerable resident rely on while family be leave fight in the tribunal for send support there be also the financial crisis in our university sector which should be the pride of our country help we to face the future prepare the next generation and deliver world class research university be also the fulcrum of the local economy in city and town across the country their collapse would be catastrophic for job and economic growth the government must therefore ensure that plan be in place that offer meaningful intervention to stem the current crisis and allow our university to stabilise and chart sustainable course when country invest in its child and young people it invest in the future when it deliver well society for child and young people it deliver well society for everyone when it act to protect the most vulnerable it place all of we on more solid foundation welcome this gracious speech from our new labour government and look forward to see the government deliver for our child and young people in the come month it be great pleasure to follow the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes spend year on these benches in opposition and know how frustrating it can be the reality be that when the sheer size of our defeat become apparent have some difficulty in come to term with it in order to characterise it do not think one can do well than our late colleague peter brooke who when describe similar calamity say the battle of isandlwana be lose so now begin the defence of the mission station at rorke drift have no doubt that the government be always go to abandon the rwanda scheme they make that absolutely clear and they have every right to do it but do think that the house will ultimately come to regret not have such deterrent to hand have it be allow to develop it could have be such deterrent it be never silver bullet but always part of complex jigsaw of measure of which of course the holy grail would be return agreement the previous government should be utterly congratulate on the return agreement they make with albania which have be tremendous success such agreement be hard to come by remember be send to negotiate with president ghani in afghanistan to try to get he to take more helpful approach give the blood and treasure that we be expend on behalf of his regime and the people of afghanistan he turn to and say my priority be the young man and woman who be take the battle to the taliban and you want to give time and resource to those people who ve choose to run away well it be fair point of course ultimately he run away himself but have little more success in negotiation on return agreement with other commonwealth member these agreement be extraordinarily hard to achieve think that we would have want third country where we could have settle people because ultimately our ability to do so will be finite and limited want to draw attention to what the prime minister say yesterday in his statement when he point out that he have just authorise very significant increase in money to regime in africa ultimately that have to be the long term answer the very long term answer we make an agreement back in with the wealthy country of the world to spend of our national income on international development in the economy of those country from which so many people be now come and will continue to come as long as the incentive of life be so much well here exist it take we until the coalition government in to actually honour that commitment to spend of our national income and we subsequently abandon it or certainly reduce it if all the nation that have enter that agreement have honour it and deliver it when they make it perhaps the flow of population from the develop world would have abate substantially and we would be deal with different situation ultimately it be all about job take zaatari the huge refugee camp on the border of jordan and syria great city now make from scratch those who be accommodate in zaatari will find that the housing provide by the united nations high commissioner for refugees be of substantially well quality than that available in many city and shanty town across the world they will find that the world food programme will feed they and their child will be educate by the un child agency perhaps most importantly security will be supply by the jordanian force and be of much great standard than they might enjoy in many other part of the world despite all those advantage people from zaatari will spend every penny they have and borrow in order to escape and get the one thing that zaatari can not supply they livelihood and future for their family that be the driver of so much migration ultimately we must return to that original policy restore the and start build for the long term world that be much more secure as consequence of the economic development available in those other place the right hon gentleman make powerful point but do he accept that much of that aid go to prop up corrupt regime which deny people the right that we have in this country and be one of the thing that drive immigration in this country if aid be misspent or use to prop up regime it be detrimental not helpful that be absolutely right but we do not do that we do not spend our money in that way we support people under desperate regime not by give money to those regime but by provide sustenance through third party and ngos which deliver that some of the great damage do by much of our own press be how our international development aid effort be paint as destructive in the way that be just describe it never be return to my original point we can not take everybody and we certainly need somewhere else where they could have go rwanda strike as somewhere that that possibility could blossom let begin by say how good it be to see the conservative party on the opposition benches and in such diminished number no doubt some will say that be be unsporte but since politic be not sport will say it anyway will never forgive conservative mp for the year of damage that they have inflict on our community child poverty have never be high and nhs waiting list have never be long life expectancy be fall and food bank queue be rise our public service be cut to the bone and our infrastructure be break our train be permanently in crisis and our river be pump full of sewage our teacher doctor and nurse have be force to strike accord to one academic study excess death between and can be attribute to tory austerity when say that politics be not sport but matter of life and death that be what mean for some it appear to be parlour game about the next zone dinner party invite but this be about people life and their material condition while the conservatives scapegoate minority and slash support for the poor they help the rich get rich worker wage be low than in but the wealth of uk billionaire be up threefold since the tories come to power the general election result show that people across the country be cry out for change our new labour government must now deliver it be pleased to say for the first time in my parliamentary career that this king speech include bills that look forward to vote for but will surprise no one by say that want our government to go far by introduce the new deal for work people and ban all zero hour contract they must totally end fire and rehire repeal all anti trade union legislation roll out sectoral collective bargaining across the economy and recognise that the argument that we make for public ownership of rail apply to water mail and energy too in the short time have to speak today want to focus on two area that believe need urgent action first if the labour party have moral mission it must be to eradicate poverty after year of the conservatives record million child be grow up in poverty they go to bed hungry they struggle more in school and their physical and mental health take hit their parent be put through hell to try to make end meet welcome the child poverty taskforce but everyone in the chamber have read the briefing and everyone know that the evidence be overwhelming the key driver of rise child poverty be the two child benefit cap and the single most effective way of tackle child poverty be immediately to lift child out of poverty by scrap this cruel policy you should vote for it will be vote for it thank you it be move back by everyone from gordon brown to all trade union affiliate to the labour party the tuc which represent million worker the archbishop of canterbury and save the children with wealth tax on asset over million we could raise the fund need to pay for the policy three time over kid should not have to suffer single day in avoidable poverty will vote for the amendment select by the speaker to scrap this cruel tory policy and at this late stage appeal to our new labour front bench team to deliver the change that the country have call for and adopt the policy and immediately lift child out of poverty the second area need urgent action relate to my amendment as we debate here in westminster rain down hell on gaza be israel fleet of fighter jet plane describe by their manufacturer as the most lethal fighter jet in the world israel have arm those jet with lb bomb with lethal radius of the equivalent of football pitch recent un report identify the bomb as have be use in emblematic case of indiscriminate and disproportionate attack on gaza attack that clearly violate international law raise this because every fighter jet be make in part here in britain in deal estimate to be worth million that be just one example of israel use of british make arm in its assault on gaza which have kill more than people disproportionately woman and child the legal threshold for these sale to be ban have clearly be meet so they should be ban there be clear risk that british make weapon might be use to commit or facilitate serious violation of international humanitarian law hence why in february un expert call on these sale to end immediately other country spain canada and the netherlands to name just few have suspend sale previous british governments suspend sale after far few israeli assault margaret thatcher in tony blair in gordon brown in and david cameron in today the palestinian people face death and destruction on scale unlike anything they have face before but british make arm be still be license to israel and use to kill innocent people again say to our new government it be time for we to uphold international law and end arm sale to israel it be great pleasure to serve in the chamber with you in the chair mr deputy speaker wish the new government front bench team well they know that have high regard for many of they include the hon member for wallasey dame angela eagle and the right hon member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson who be in their place as patriot wish the government well because they be in position to run our country and there will be many matter on which we can agree have work with number of government members on the kind of matter that go well beyond punch and judy politic if can call it that particularly on national security however those good wish be not the same as wishful thinking too much wishful thinking pervade the government benches have make change itself the brand the risk they face be think that change alone be enough cs lewis say if you look for truth you may find comfort in the end if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin and in the end despair nevertheless wish the government well we be debate number of challenge in this aspect of the king speech today but none more challenging than that of lawlessness too often when we debate crime lawlessness and order in this chamber we give too little regard to the victim of crime we simply must end the culture which have pervade for most of my lifetime of believe that crime be an illness to be treat it be not an illness it be malevolent choice make by those who be careless of the harm they do when we understand that we understand why the principal objective of the criminal justice system must be punishment justly retributive response to that malevolence be necessary not only because it be the right thing to do but because it be the component of the criminal justice system which maintain the public faith that justice will be do and be see to be do be listen intently to the right hon gentleman speech do he therefore believe that people be bear wicked believe that with good education at very early age and early intervention crime can be prevent imagine you will not allow to talk about the fall from the state of grace and the character of sin mr deputy speaker but let say briefly to the hon lady that human being be capable of the great wickedness and the great good when they choose to do good they can do immensely joyful thing hope that the people in this chamber all seek to do good which be why begin my speech by wish the government well my experience of this place be that people regardless of party be here because they want to make their constituent well off and the country they live in happy and more agreeable place of course people have the capacity to do good but we know too that people can do the most dreadful thing and when they do so it be absolutely right that law abide decent patriotic people see that they get their just desert that be not strange or curious idea it be one that have inform most criminal justice system in all civilisation for all of time and the most obvious way of ensure that people who do harm get their just desert be to incarcerate they that bring to the second principle of the criminal justice system which be that we take people out of harm way the good way of do that be to imprison those who seek to do harm be shocked as be my constituent that the government now intend to let more of those dangerous people on to our street we be now tell that people will be release include people who have do violent thing who have hurt and damage other people life after they have serve of their sentence when most people represent hear of sentence for such crime they assume that people will serve of it of course that have not be the case for long time but we now know that the government on the ground of prison overcrowding be to release many more of these dangerous people on to our street be afraid that the wishful thinking describe early will soon turn to the wish that the government would see the sense of why that be an entirely unacceptable course of action the last conservative government add to the number of prison place but not enough and not fast enough think all of we on the conservative benches would acknowledge that but give where we be we simply can not subject the british people to the fear and not only fear but the reality of let out of prison other who would do they harm let we deal with the third aspect of criminal justice which be to try to prevent recidivism by reform those in prison as minister work on prison education because it be important that we try to ensure that people who have commit crime and have be punish for do so do not commit another but that can not be the only or define characteristic of criminal justice we have to recognise what philip bean the criminologist in the say retribution have to be core part of what the public see in order to maintain their faith in the system and in what the government and the authority be do yes let we have debate about rehabilitation let we try to save soul not only because it prevent recidivism but because it be the right thing to do for those individual but we should understand that punishment be not dirty word it be what most of our constituent take for grant yet never hear those sentiment express with any vehemence or conviction by the liberal establishment in this country which unfortunately be too well represent in this place do my right hon friend agree that there be different type of crime and different type of prisoner and that many people in our prison system at the moment particularly those responsible for relatively low level non violent antisocial behaviour could powerfully serve much well and more rehabilitative community sentence do not want chain gang in norfolk and lincolnshire but good community service where people can see that they be actually put something back into society would ease lot of pressure on the system community sentence can play part that be true but my hon friend will recall that the problem describe early of misunderstand crime as an illness to be treat have its root in think that stretch right back to the you will perhaps know mr deputy speaker that the children and young persons act begin intermediate treatment order which essentially reward young people who have commit crime with the kind of community activity that my hon friend describe people be send to the brecon beacons when their law abide neighbour have to make do with week in clacton mean no disrespect to clacton or its representative hasten to add laughter that be not the kind of response to crime that the vast majority of my constituent or suspect those of my hon friend expect yes community sentence can play part but they must not in any way distract we from the fundamental truth think it be grotius who say it mr deputy speaker that criminal justice have to have at its heart the idea of an ill suffer for an ill inflict hope that the new government will recognise that to crack down on crime they really do have to restore public faith in the fact that as say justice will be do it be fact that of convict criminal be responsible for half of all conviction it be true too that those individual be know and can be identify and must not be release in the way that have be suggest yet disturbingly the new prisons minister be on the record as say we addict to sentencing we addict to punishment so many people who be in prison in my view should be there that be both the opposite of the truth and anything but what most people think welcome the attention give in the king speech to shoplifting but again fear that the government approach amount to little more than wishful thinking we have shoplifting epidemic in britain police force do not respond to almost nine out of serious incident and uk retailer already spend around billion each year on try to deal with problem with which they struggle to cope many offender persistently commit crime and get away with it so let we in this debate and in the programme that follow it not simply rely on wishful thinking but face up to the profound truth which seem to have escape the notice of labour governments forever and too often of conservative governments too reflect the sentiment of the vast majority of law abide people mean the guilty must be punish and the innocent must be protect call dr beccy cooper to make her maiden speech it be privilege to make my maiden speech among such an outstanding group of people hope that people who have see the maiden speech over the past few day and will watch they in the day week and month to come might see some of the warmth kindness and decency that have meet in my fellow mps in these first couple of week in parliament be the newly elect member for the beautiful constituency of worthe west nestle between the south down and the english channel we be often describe as that area just west of our big sister brighton but as with all young sister we have many often unsung merit about which it will be my absolute pleasure to tell the house little today worthe west be make up of two third of worthe town the other third now be ably represent by my hon friend the

privileged to be part of the sussex bay project movement of radical collaboration initiate by adur worthe councils with the mission of restore healthy blue ecosystem to our sea and waterway in which nature people and the local economy can thrive worthe west be also home to the beautiful coastal and country village of ferring east preston angmering findon clapham and patching can tell any keen camper have not be in parliament long enough to know how many mps actually like be without wi fi and good latte but be hop to find few that the fox wood campsite in patching be firm local favourite there be two very handy pub near the site the fox and the worlds end which serve the most excellent food when your fire will not light and even the kid be sick of bean on toast be only the second member of parliament to represent worthe west it be first form in and for the past year have be represent by sir peter bottomley who know be very well respect here as the father of the house he be know for work cross party on variety of important campaign include leasehold reform and the infected blood scandal sir peter and share great affection for worthe west and during the election campaign we often bump into each other enjoy quick cuppa with constituent should confess at this point that be northerner originally adopt by the south as one of its own and good brew be must have for day to start and end well we have many excellent cafés in our area to anyone who be listen to my speech and think that this newbie mp be not do too bad job of sell the merit of her home town can thoroughly recommend the cake at sea lane café on goring beach the coffee at both coast café and finch in worthe town centre and the breakfast at the bluebird café in ferring among many other at this point should also confess that my extolling of the virtue of cake and all credit to the house staff for the incredible muffin in the parliamentary café be temper by the fact that be by profession medical doctor and as my child will testify be reasonably obsess with make sure that cake be part of healthy balance that allow we to enjoy all the different type of food to be fair my child would not necessarily recognise that description and might just say that their mum be bit of nag with carrot obsession and an aversion to play computer game for too long but such be the joy of parenthood when people ask what type of doctor be and definitely do not have the patience for phd the response that be public health consultant be often meet with slightly puzzled stare recalibration of what they have hear and the decision that be probably gp by another name however be delighted to join my hon friend the member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams to represent public health here in the house it be the reason choose to go into politic it be the art and science of keep population well and help people to live healthy life appreciate that today debate primarily concern home affair and immigration so will talk about public health on the basis of the explicit principle that health be essential in all thing to ensure safety and security for all people as part of my public health training spend time with the health protection agency now part of public health england that training stand in particularly good stead during the pandemic when find myself with daily slot on bbc radio sussex talk about covid debunk myth and provide reassurance that our fantastic scientist and public health specialist be do everything possible to develop vaccination and to keep we safe the result of the covid inquiry publish last week reveal the clear conclusion that investment in preventive measure be always money well spend and that be sadly lack before the pandemic public health funding be cut by between and so there be some salient lesson to be learn quickly about prevention be well than cure my time in local government as public health consultant and subsequently as councillor and council leader teach that politics be often the frontline where we grapple with the issue that arise from inequality and inequity two indicator which tell we that the decision make by those of we in position of influence be not yet decision that be maximise the health and wellbeing of the people we represent the resource require to meet basic human need should be available to everyone regardless of where we live or which family we be bear into for people like in public health and politic there be wealth of datum and evidence as well as would contend basic common sense show that when resource be not allocate fairly to allow everyone basic human need to be meet we all suffer for it people do not thrive without clean water clean air access to green space and good food our physical body become far less resilient to illness when those be not available to we and the same be true of poor housing poor education and poor job the causal link between poor housing condition and poor health outcome be long establish with health outcome associate with poor housing cost the nhs an estimate billion every year we know that exposure to poor housing condition include damp cold mould and noise be strongly associate with poor health both physical and mental inequality in life expectancy be increase especially for woman in worthe west woman live in one of our poor area will live an average of year less than woman live in one of our wealthy area and for the population as whole the time spend in poor health be increase as sir michael marmot so saliently put it if health have stop improve it be sign that society have stop improve when people become physically and mentally ill potential be lose and before you know it your country do not have national health service it have an overwhelmed national sickness service be so proud and privileged to be part of the labour intake of for too long now our politic have be make people sick this be the start of journey that very much hope will lead to politics that help to keep people well for many generation to come reduce inequality and inequity will allow everyone to do well the politic of health be the narrative of our nation government who focus on the health and wellbeing of the people we serve be government who enable we to rise together to face the challenge of both today and tomorrow congratulate the new hon member for worthe west dr cooper on an excellent speech she will clearly be force to be reckon with in this chamber and beyond and wish she well in her parliamentary career she follow the former father of the house so she have big shoe to fill thank the good citizen of harrow east who have allow to return to the house for the fifth time be delighted that on what be not great night for my party be able not only to hold my share of the vote but to increase my majority substantially although sadly be probably the only conservative member to do so also thank many colleague from the opposite side who come to visit my constituency during that time and enjoy the hospitality of the resident of harrow east while at the same time increase my majority harrow east be of course the most multiracial and most multi religious constituency and have great adherence to religious faith than any other constituency in the country be proud to represent people of all faith and none and in particular the large number who have come from the commonwealth to live in this country and to live in harrow east be dedicate to serve they to the good of my ability for as long as they wish to do so give the debate we be have today on the gracious speech there be some thing that want to raise particularly on home affair we have hear from the home secretary about the government plan to deal with both legal and illegal migration one challenge for the new government will be very clear how we deal with the illegal migrant who have come to this country and who would have be go to rwanda or another place for resettlement clearly there be decision to be make by the home office about what happen to those people because the previous government could not return they to their previous country that will have to happen and the other challenge will be how we stop this country be magnet for illegal migration in the first place we all want to see that happen and it be vital that it be do obviously we have challenge in other field and welcome the word in the king speech and indeed the new prime minister word about many of the thing to be include in the new government programme be absolutely delighted to hear that they will continue with the tobacco and vape bill which as many colleague will know have champion through parliament on many occasion we have reach the end of its committee stage which you will remember mr deputy speaker but we do not progress the bill afterwards hope that it will be introduce rapidly and that we can get it on to the statute book as fast as possible the hon member for wallasey dame angela eagle who be on the front bench will welcome my say that the football governance bill need to be progress quickly as well so that we encourage the football club that we love to be properly organise and help be also pleased that the holocaust memorial bill which complete its stage in this house will be enact as fast as possible prior to the election be the co chair of the all party parliamentary group for the holocaust memorial and educational centre the fact be that antisemitism in this country be rife and have grow and we must combat it at every possible stage we must also ensure that the memorial and learning centre be place alongside this building so that we can demonstrate to the world that we must learn the lesson of what happen during the second world war and the holocaust and never allow it to happen again it be vital that our young people and old people understand the consequence of that and such work have be do on cross party basis in many way it be go to be absolutely vital to work on cross party basis the hon member for coventry south zarah sultana who be still in her place raise the issue of what be go on in gaza right now notice that she make no mention of the hostage who be still hold by the terrorist and the need for they to be return once that happen the weight of the world can lead to cessation of hostility and indeed peaceful resolution in the middle east do the hon gentleman also note that there be no mention at all of the cynical way in which hamas have use civilian as human shield they have use their school hospital and home they be guilty of cause many of the civilian death that have occur because they have cynically use their own people rise will the hon member give way will answer the hon gentleman point before give way to those on the other side the reality be that on october the jewish people suffer the bad atrocity since the holocaust we must remember that that be what happen but we must also recognise the deprivation that the palestinians in gaza be suffer at this point in time be sure that the new government will seek to ensure that justice be bring to all and that the terrorist be not allow to thrive or gain will move on to one or two other area will the hon member give way will not the hon lady have have chance to speak already will mention some other aspect of government legislation clearly we have to combat the abuse of woman and child and will work with colleague from across the house on that issue in the last parliament champion woman go into refuge so that they can be help by people outside rather than have intrusion from public service when they be in desperate circumstance of course we must make sure that the police be properly train properly skilled and able to deliver the service provide equally we must get the message to our police and crime commissioner and particularly to the labour mayor of london that more work must be do to combat crime but also to recruit police officer and make sure that they be properly train to do the job that they should be do have already discuss the abolition of the vagrancy act with the home secretary as many colleague will know have champion the plight of homeless people in this place the fact that homeless people still face be criminalise on our street be disgrace and an affront to our society we have try on several occasion to get the act remove from the statute book it should be consign to the history book as fast as possible and people should be give the right to have proper home of their own one that they can be proud of live in equally we have to recognise that have secure job that bring in an income be the good route out of poverty despite the rhetoric we have hear the reality be that the last government create an economic miracle give the number of job create we create more job in this country than the whole of the european union combine and the reality be that that be the route we should be pursue finally when the prime minister speak in the debate on the gracious speech he recognise the late jo cox and the late david amess both of whom suffer the ultimate problem of be an mp death in service we must combat that and make sure that all mp regardless of their political position be safe secure and able to do their job say gently to colleague on the government front bench that we agree on cross party basis that the pre recess adjournment debate in the summer would be forever know as the sir david amess pre recess adjournment debate be disappointed that the government have choose not to have pre recess adjournment debate but they still have time to adjust the timetable accordingly call mark ferguson to make his maiden speech thank you mr deputy speaker for allow to speak in this debate and

labour oppose this cap we have hear its leader talk passionately about make sure it be do away with labour members have get to vote tonight to show that this be an early challenge for the hon gentleman and hon lady who now represent scottish constituency this be very much change house and congratulate the labour government on their quite stunning victory also want to congratulate my new labour colleague on their victory across scotland really hope they enjoy be an mp and the experience that this offer in this house represent our wonderful nation on these green benches but they will know from the bitter experience of that tide come in and tide go out the only thing that seem to be constant in scottish politic be that there will always be member of parliament from the scottish national party represent perthshire in scotland and want to thank the people of perth and kinross shire for return for record seventh time in year promise that will serve they as have serve all my constituent in the past year on these benches immigration be the subject of the day and this be important this be big stuff it be really important that the government get this right but be not encourage by what have hear so far be not really sure and certain that labour really know what it want to do when it come to immigration have hear lot of tough talk with strong language on deportation enforcement and get people out of this country what want to hear about be the experience of these people who come to our country in appal destitution and poverty who have live through some of the most unimaginable experience who be real live being and who do not want the scapegoate language that have be deploy in the past think about they explain to we the safe and legal route by which people can get to this country open up way for citizenship to be acquire let be creative for goodness sake let have some of these asylum seeker work why be it right that they have be leave unattended for so long surely new labour government could start to get into that sort of territory but be not encourage by what have hear thus far from the labour party we do not want tory hostile environment to be replace by labour hostile environment we need to see well understanding and empathy about the plight of people who be leave war zone devastate and traumatise by what have happen to they what we want to hear be proper thought out pragmatic approach to immigration that finally acknowledge the value of immigration and that have humanity and common decency at its core that be not too much to ask from labour government this be priority for we in scotland we be the only part of the united kingdom whose population be predict to fall by our population will be start to decline we will have small base of work people who be expect to support non active age population which raise whole series of issue and difficulty for we particularly economic issue and this have to be address we also have to make sure that our public service be staff such be their current situation and condition that if every school leaver in scotland go into social care next year there still would not be enough people to fill the place require we need to hear solution and we be start to get there during the general election campaign be encourage that the party be actually talk about scottish visa which be the rolls royce gold standard we require it happen in nation across the world without issue and without difficulty so it could happen here the nation of the united kingdom have their own political jurisdiction and they even have their own tax code to ensure that it can happen we have do it before be member of this house when the previous labour government deliver the fresh talent initiative and it work cheer they on when it be deliver and it be something this government could do if scottish labour members want to go to the home office to demand solution to our very real difficulty and problem we will hold their jacket and cheer they on but they must do something because this be press issue for the scottish economy gently say to conservative members that over the last couple of year we have hear such degree of rubbish from they they try to tell we that people would not come to scotland from the rest of the united kingdom because apparently they be put off by our low council tax our low house price our free tuition and our free prescription charge most of all they say that people would not come to scotland because we have ask they to pay just few more pound of income tax well that fox be well and truly shoot as national records of scotland have show that there be net migration into scotland so let we not hear any more about that rubbish end with plea to our scottish colleague we want to work with they to ensure that we get scottish solution to scottish problem it be now up to they they have the power and the responsibility they can make these change to sort out our immigration and for goodness sake they should back we in the lobby tonight so that we can do something about child poverty in scotland call andy macnae to make his maiden speech be grateful for this opportunity to make my maiden speech in this important debate be in awe of the maiden speech and all the other speech that have be make today and on previous day the standard and quality of both this intake and long serve members be inspiring be fill with excitement pride and belief in what we can achieve in the year to come it be truly exciting time be honour and privileged to speak as the member for rossendale and darwen my home be very aware that this could happen only because of huge amount of hard work by friend and labour colleague across the constituency and of course because of the decision make by so many of my fellow resident to put their trust in and change labour party offer my heartfelt thank to everyone who put in this place will do my very good not to let they down my constituency and home be special place indeed be tempt to say that it represent the very good of lancashire but wary of controversy will simply say that it be wonderful part of wonderful county it be post industrial place of moor hill and valley that frame the community of darwen whitworth bacup crawshawbooth stacksteads weir waterfoot rawtenstall edenfield helmshore and the west pennine village will have miss one out so be sure will be shoot as soon as get home in represent my home succeed sir jake berry who serve our constituency for year pay tribute to he for his service and in particular his work campaign on provision for child with special educational need rossendale and darwen be very much swing seat prior to we have be splendidly represent by janet anderson be pleased and proud to call janet friend we sadly lose she last year but will always remember she as true role model of constituency mp she be always available always responsive always engage and always willing to roll up her sleeve and get stick in what more can say about rossendale and darwen will spare member full geography lesson and go for some fun ish fact first the constituency be quirk of boundary commission methodology that will forever remain mystery to we there be little historical or physical connection between rossendale and darwen indeed driver have to leave the constituency to travel between the two half rossendale be once know as the golden valley and lie at the very heart of the industrial revolution indeed book on that time by local author chris aspin be subtitle when rossendale lead the world we be also refer to as the valley of stone and the flagstone in trafalgar square come from rossendale quarry crown in darwen be britain old paint maker in mahatma gandhi come to meet mill worker in darwen seek to understand the hardship they be face on reflection that in itself be quite remarkable he say they treat as one of their own shall never forget that this sense of inclusion and understanding remain we have many wonderful community organisation and while be reluctant to single anyone out must pay tribute to the vital work do in my hometown by the bacup family centre and bacup pride and across the constituency by our volunteer lead food bank and credit union and keep darwen tidy and civic pride rossendale to which wish the good of luck in britain in bloom judging this week something we be less proud of be that rossendale be the only local authority area in the north without any sort of commuter railway service which be fact that hope the secretary of state for transport my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh do not become too bored of hearing have few more darwen be home to darwen live the uk and possibly europe big free music festival mr fitzpatrick in rawtenstall be britain last survive temperance bar darwen football club be form in and be the first club in the world to have professionally pay player and brent peters manager of bacup borough football club be say to be the long serve manager in world football rossendale and darwen be distinct place each with deep history at the same time they have much in common be in many way hearten that during the campaign one of my most frequent ask be for well politic the people of rossendale and darwen be honest and hard work they value integrity co operation and community service and they want to see this in their politician believe this reflect feeling across the country and hence it be great opportunity and responsibility for we with over new mp we have real chance to set new tone to work together across the house and to hold to the standard that our resident expect of we less positive thing that rossendale and darwen have in common be concern about the direction in which too many of our school have be head too many parent agonise over the choice or lack of choice available to they it simply must not be the case that child future be determine by an education lottery that every school be good school be an imperative we must hold to and be proud to see our new labour government commit to remove barrier to opportunity raise school standard and ensure that the school system be fair for every child another commonality be our topography hill crag moor and valley be climber and cyclist and these be my playground be fortunate to have enjoy an active life which have turn into career it have take to amazing place and know that be healthy wise and happy as result in many way what these sport have teach be what have bring here it be sad fact that in the uk today nearly of the population be not active enough for good health this contribute to one in six death and be estimate to cost the uk economy billion annually yet physical activity can help to prevent and manage over chronic disease and condition include some cancer heart disease type diabete and depression overall it be recognise that spend on physical activity generate of benefit in return in short invest in physical activity be no brainer it have be hearten to see the importance of prevention recognise so clearly in our manifesto in this debate and indeed at question time this morning sport and physical activity can change life and they can save life active life start young yet around of do not get enough exercise how often do we hear kid tell we there be nothing to do around here believe that every child should feel they have full and inclusive access to the countryside and to recreational facility that give they the opportunity to live active life escape constraint and explore their potential believe this mission underpin many other and look forward to speak again on this subject in the year to come the hill of rossendale matter to in other way on the moor close to home we scatter the ash of our daughter mallorie she have be bear in burnley hospital with edward syndrome condition we be tell be not compatible with life her time with we be short but her impact on our life be great the support we have from burnley hospital and local baby loss charity friend of serenity be vital while edward syndrome be rare it be far from be the only cause of baby loss every day an average of family suffer the pain of baby loss that be around family year some report suggest that up to one in five of those family tragedy be avoidable there be grow movement around baby loss awareness indeed in october we have baby loss awareness week hope to use my time in this house to support the ongoing drive for great care and support for the family affect by baby loss and for continued improvement in its prevention rise on point of order mr deputy speaker yesterday table an amendment to the humble address that read at end add and submit that the government should immediately recognise the state of palestine the wording be confirm by to the table office at pm yesterday it be co sign by the hon member for blackburn mr hussain for leicester south shockat adam for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed and the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn order be it the hon gentleman intention to challenge the ruling of mr speaker when he select the amendment to be vote on tonight what be his point of order far to that point of order mr deputy speaker it be the fact that the amendment be not table despite be submit to the table office on time note what the hon gentleman have say but do not think that would have make any difference to mr speaker decision about which amendment the house will be vote on later however his point be note call nigel farage to make his maiden speech believe it be customary in maiden speech for the member to pay tribute to their predecessor which be very happy to do giles watling be very decent nice honourable man he be former actor who wear his garrick club tie there be nothing even vaguely conservative about he but he be jolly nice chap and it be clean fought campaign early the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes make reference to clacton as be the place for traditional english seaside holiday and indeed it be with its pier mile of sandy beach and arcade perhaps it be not as popular holiday destination as it use to be now that people go to spain and elsewhere but it be still there other part of the constituency be genteel and quite wealthy but if we go to jaywick we find the most deprived community in the whole united kingdom those community have little faith trust or belief that government can make their life well indeed what find when knock on door be that people be say we want to work we want to get on and make money but as soon as we work hour week or more our benefit get take away so we well off stay on benefit feel immensely sorry for those people because the benefit system which be design to help they be actually keep they trap in level of relative poverty will do my good as the mp for the area to bring business investment private money into the constituency with job training and skill can not promise that will do it but will do my absolute damnedest to make it happen it be funny because spend nearly year as member of the european parliament in brussels and with its monthly journey to strasbourg have to say that this place be very different indeed it be small there be not chauffeur drive mercedes available for each member there be no large lump sum of money that member do not have to spend on anything or show receipt for wonder whether that be why so many in the british political system seem to adore the european union so much because it be rather wonderful place to work what do not expect be to come here and find that with my reform team be more outnumber here than we be in the european parliament because there be more supporter of brexit in the european parliament than sense there be in this parliament of this be very much remainer parliament suspect in many case that it be really rejoiner parliament if we look at the king speech it be interesting that the word immigration be mention only twice and asylum just once perhaps that be not surprise as when the now prime minister lay out the six big priority for the labour party before the general election he do not mention legal or illegal immigration that be the other area in which the five of we sit on the reform bench will find ourselves massively outnumber in the house because we actually want to talk about these issue believe that the population explosion be have big impact on the quality of life of ordinary folk than any other issue it all start of course when the current home secretary become member of parliament back in may it be worth remind ourselves that net migration be the same during the late the whole of the the whole of the the whole of the the whole of the and in the up until mr blair net migration run at to year for over half century then mr blair get in and decide that we be go to open the door in way that have never be do before to the delight and joy of big company especially giant multinational who have always want as much cheap labour as they can get and to hell with the consequence for working class family and people perhaps it be even more of surprise to see that massive acceleration in our population through immigration then far accelerate because despite promise in four consecutive manifesto the conservative party actually accelerate what have happen under the year of mr blair so we have see population increase of million people since the time that labour win its last landslide even the net figure be migrant minute even during the course of this debate many hundred more people will have come to our country nobody be make the argument that there be not some exceptionally wonderful people among they there be of course but the sheer level of population mean we have to build new house every two minute even if the labour government be able to fulfil the million house that they want to build during the lifetime of this parliament that will make no dent at all in the current shortage of housing rent have rise by since why population increase and pressure the list go on from access to health service to congestion and pressure on infrastructure the population crisis have the big impact on people life damage their quality of life and virtually nobody in this place even want to talk about it it be on illegal immigration that really want to make point four year ago go out into the english channel repeatedly film dinghy come across the channel with an average of people per boat be describe as be sad lonely desperate figure always seek attention and have no doubt there be some who think that be still the case today spot on thank you but do it because it be obvious to what be go to happen it be obvious that there would be huge influx of people illegally come to britain across the english channel and it would happen because we have stop deport people who come to britain illegally perhaps the labour party might want to reflect on the last period of labour government when we have home secretary such as david blunkett who be far far to the right of people like the shadow home secretary today if someone come to britain illegally during the last labour government their foot do not touch the ground they be go they be out indeed in the last year of that labour government from to people who come here illegally be deport none of that happen any more it do not happen under year of the conservatives and it clearly be not go to happen under this labour government and wonder why think we will find that it be because of the increase role of court overseas that be set up in the wake of world war two with the very good of intention but that have now completely outlive its usefulness it be of course the european court of human rights and it be labour government who enshrine the convention into british law we will not stop the boat even if we send handful to rwanda we will not stop the boat by attempt to smash the criminal gang we have be do that to the drug industry in britain year after year decade after decade with no success whatsoever the financial reward for smuggle people across the english channel can now net gang million to million week whatever prison sentence or penalty be put upon they there will always be people volunteer to make million of euro week we will stop this only if we start deport people who come illegally then they will not pay the smuggler but we will do that only by leave the echr have fun suggestion that would liven up politic engage the public and see massively increase turnout why do we not have referendum on whether we continue to be member of the echr call lola mcevoy to make her maiden speech it be customary to pay tribute to the speaker before for his first contribution to this house but let we face it that be quite polished contribution that he have have year to prepare so thank you to he this be my maiden speech as the first woman to represent darlington from the government benches wish to pay tribute to baroness chapman the first female mp for darlington for pave the way she smash that glass ceiling and now have the privilege of serve our

the country despite the jolly fisherman be the symbol of skegness my constituent be not feel very jolly at the moment seven out of of they vote to leave the european union they trust the previous government they take they at their word but they now feel sense of political betrayal in number of area the first people who be not very jolly be the fisherman themselves who feel that various bureaucrat include the environment agency natural england and the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities be act so as to try to suppress or destroy this great industry for our seafaring nation one that produce food and generate great revenue in addition bureaucrat be make the issue of flood serious problem in my constituency thousand of home have be flood and with failure to properly maintain sea level defence ten of thousand of home be at risk again because of bureaucracy and inertia another reason why my constituent be really quite grumpy be that the stupid net zero policy will result in hundred of massive ugly pylon blight the environment and countryside of my constituency as well as solar farm plan on incredibly productive agricultural farmland it be absolute idiocy then of course there be another big issue that be make my constituent very grumpy indeed one of the slogan for leave the european union be to take back control the previous government promise it do you remember that slogan it be about money law and border yes border it be about control immigration and have smart immigration work integrate and speak the language which we should all agree be great thing instead the previous government open the door to mass immigration with significant consequence for town such as boston and other town up and down the country will give member an example every morning in the centre of boston dozen and dozen of east europeans arrive in the marketplace with nothing to do they have be hoof out of the house in multiple occupation where they be hot bed two or three shift day on the same mattress because of mass uncontrolled immigration they have get nothing to do and they have be aid and abet in come to the uk by false promise make by morally bankrupt business which be help they to get national insurance number for overseas person under scheme that we think have close we think the eu settlement scheme have close but it turn out that it have not if someone fib about how much time they have spend here before they can still apply so many be still arrive and they be not integrate they be not learn the language and regrettably it create an intimidating atmosphere in the centre of the town know this go on elsewhere the implication be most seriously feel by woman who work in the town centre who feel unsafe leave their place of work and by constituent who do not want to go into the centre of this great market town at night because they fear frankly that it be not safe when they go there at night there be no chance of see any police whatsoever have be there on number of occasion what those people will see be drug dealer in the centre of the marketplace ply their hideous vile trade night in and night out that be completely unacceptable during the election campaign go to numerous house for example there be one where seven people be live in house with two bedroom it be bulgarian family and only one member of that family speak any english at all they say we here to claim benefit your health benefit and housing benefit we would prefer it in bulgaria but we want to take your benefit and then send the money home that be what be go on up and down the country and it be completely unacceptable interruption there be mutter the truth hurt the establishment do not want to talk about this do they order the convention be that during maiden speech everybody keep very quiet whatever you think of what be be say for maiden speech keep quiet repeat that smart immigration work integrate speak the language be great thing but there be serious consequence of uncontrolled mass immigration as member of parliament for this great constituency my objective be to attract more business and more investment the great port of boston need to grow and expand and we want more infrastructure for example new bypass around boston itself with these thing my constituency of boston and skegness can be great once again call jo white to make her maiden speech begin by thank the people of bassetlaw for put here my commitment be to serve all resident to the good of my ability thank the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice

recognition of her commitment on the record also pay tribute to another predecessor stephen lloyd my good friend whose service to our town inspire my own he be complete and utter legend there be another predecessor as the member of parliament for eastbourne whose memory this house can and must never forget ian gow who serve from until he be appallingly assassinate in few year before my time ian gow be remember and still admire by eastbournians as an extremely hard work member of parliament the shield that honour he in this house serve as reminder of his service his grave sacrifice and our duty to pursue debate and disagreement with civility respect and peace turn to the subject of this debate want to share migration story that say lot about the character of my town it start on summer day in eastbourne when sweet retired lady mrs baker notice curious sight she see another lady also white push small black boy in pram mrs baker curious strike up conversation with that woman and ask what be go on mrs baker learn that the boy have be send to live with that woman by young nigerian couple and she be care for the boy while the couple study in london inspire mrs baker say that

toki die early this year sat in the chapel during his funeral turn behind and among sea of nigerian face be one white lady also pay her respect charmaine baker from the baker family that moment give goosebump just like those moment when old school eastbournians look at in all my brownness all my gayness and all my working class rootedness and say josh you be one of our own share that story to say that while eastbourne hospitality tradition be often associate with the mighty bucket and spade they go far deeply eastbourne true hospitality tradition be of generosity welcome tolerance multiculturalism and compassion the story of how end up in this house be testament to that and believe that with those value the same go for our country regardless of what other member in various place in this house may say while our town benefit from more sunshine hour than any other in the country that blare sun sometimes cast shadow too be gutte to say that eastbourne be also home to the busy food bank in the country last year it distribute more food parcel per head than any other food bank in the uk accord to the trussell trust that be why work with eastbourne food bank inspirational ceo howard wardle lead eastbourne to become the first council in the country to declare cost of live emergency and to unlock emergency funding for those struggle most it be also why sincerely believe that the government should be even more ambitious in lead the fight against poverty by scrap the two child benefit cap compassionate state be by no mean state that make we soft or weak in fact care be power we can not have enterprise innovation or justice if we do not have culture of care and compassion that have underpin my career work found and run an organisation support vulnerable young people out of crime out of gang and into employment our constituent have send we here to be bold in rebuild and reimagine our great country spirit of have one another back as eastbourne mp will strive to achieve nothing less it be pleasure to take part in the debate and to see labour home office team in their place may congratulate the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde on charming speech under the previous government we become used to theatrical announcement of legislation on crime and punishment that go nowhere while the infrastructure of our court and prison decay so be encourage last week to hear the straightforward way in which the lord chancellor make her statement on the prison population the overcrowding of prison be problem that the labour government inherit and problem that they intend to solve the early release scheme run by the previous administration be chaotic the probation service be completely overstretch and prisoner be be release without support have speak before in the house about the appalling condition in our prison most recently after visit to wormwood scrubs prison which be sadly no long in my constituency visit the scrubs with the previous prison minister the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar despite the good effort of governor and staff we be meet with overcrowding double up in single cell with unshielded toilet hour lock up and building subject to extreme of temperature due to antiquated heating and cool system be it any wonder that with the prison population so high and condition near uninhabitable prison as rehabilitative exercise be thing of the past one might think that the squalor and violence that blight many prison act as deterrent in fact it ingrain and normalise the culture of offend and reoffende welcome the announcement from the government and the home secretary in the knife crime action plan it be right that we ban the sale of zombie knife ninja sword and machete but there be another angle to this home office homicide statistic show that more than of all death from knife attack be cause by kitchen knife two year ago the elderly parent of one of my constituent be stab to death by man with serious mental health condition who then kill himself the weapon in those horrific crime be kitchen knife take from his family home in the past facilitate meeting between home office official and campaigner call for knife for general sale to be make with rounded tip that be simple but effective way of reduce death and serious injury which hope the government will take up another problem inherit from the previous government and one that know will be top priority for the lord chancellor be the court backlog there be human cost to the backlog victim of crime waiting year for justice child trap in limbo in the family court system and the bereaved waiting year for inquest in the coroner court those issue be inextricably link with other failing of the previous government include the systematic destruction of legal aid result in chronic shortage of legal aid provider an unprecedented barrister strike and court in such bad state of disrepair that they be unable to function all of we who have be involve in the legal profession know how important the role of legal aid and early advice be and we look forward to the full implementation of the bellamy review there be many more problem within the justice system that this government will seek to address over the next few year the criminal cases review commission must be make fit for purpose here again the lord chancellor have already take action the terrible mistake in devise and expand imprisonment for public protection must be unwound anti slapp legislation be need to protect free speech it would also be good to see the implementation of lord leveson proposal for low cost arbitration in medium case finally know that the lord chancellor be committed to introduce all aspect of the propose hillsborough law alongside legal aid to victim of state actor to create level playing field in inquest and inquiry welcome addition would be the national oversight mechanism propose by inquest and other campaign group to ensure that inquiry recommendation be actually implement it be great relief to know that justice and home affair issue be back at the top of the government list of priority have no doubt that this labour government will achieve the change they promise and be look forward to work with colleague to help make that happen believe that tribute have not yet be pay to the hon member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae for his fantastic maiden speech apologise if do not notice that want to put on the record what wonderful speech he give particularly his personal story his campaigning for those who have suffer child loss and his work for the north hope that we have see future minister for the north in he thank my constituent for return to the re form runneymede and weybridge constituency since then

for various charity she be an amazing community champion and pay tribute to she and wish she well in her ongoing treatment in the two minute have leave would like to talk about amendment which stand in my name to the motion on his majesty most gracious speech sadly my amendment be not pick for vote but see it as the first stage in the battle against the government awful policy to tax education like many people across the uk and in runnymede and weybridge where one in five child be educate in the independent sector as family we have also choose independent education for our child so declare financial interest as part of this campaign have speak to many independent school in my patch which have tell that to of kid will move back to the state sector as result of the policy most parent who send their kid to independent school be not the mega rich magnate characterise by the government but like all parent people who make difficult budgeting decision on how to spend their money the policy of tax education which we have never do before and never should will only put more pressure on the state sector there will be more disruption for the kid who be force to move out disruption that the covid generation of child just do not need sincerely hope that the government will look at the challenge the problem and the fact that lot of child with special educational need in independent education do not have education health and care plan and be thus save the government money and think again about this awful policy will hold they to account as will many of my colleague on the conservative benches call nesil caliskan to make her maiden speech be honour to deliver my maiden speech and thank the wonderful people of barking who have elect if you will indulge mr deputy speaker would also like to thank my wonderful husband who have be by my side every step of the way this year have be quite the year for we with new baby girl seven month old and general election be call sleep have not be on our side as household but of course it have all be worth it and now have the absolute privilege of represent the east london constituency of barking would like to pay tribute to my predecessor the right hon dame margaret hodge who serve diligently as the member of parliament for bark for three decade dame margaret have become know not only for her tenaciousness but for her warmth she hold several ministerial post in the last labour government and serve as chair of the public accounts committee from take on and win against the far right in barking to campaign against tax evasion and avoidance dame margaret be always fiercely brave in stand up for what she think be right regardless of political party as prepare for my maiden speech think about some of the parallel between margaret family and my own margaret family be jewish escape nazi occupy europe and margaret herself flee egypt for the united kingdom in in fear of persecution my grandparent osman and neriman tango be of turkish cypriot muslim background they escape violence in cyprus arrive in london on christmas eve in my mum alev be bear in cyprus in and be care for in united nations tent the three of they seek safety in the melting pot that be london east end they speak no english they have no qualification and no money but they be safe as stand in this chamber and address hon member can not help but think of my grandfather my late grandmother and my mum do not think my grandparent could have envision that in one generation their granddaughter would be member of the mother of all parliaments it show what be possible in this country and feel so deeply honour to be here thank my mum who teach and my two sister neri and eda that we must always try our good work hard look after and care for other when they need our help be grateful for an education and when we can find way to give back those be my value and know that they be the value hold by family in my constituency barking and dagenham be special community in london and place that have come to know and love many of my constituent have similar story to my family with heritage from different part of the world there be also community in my constituency that have live there for generation deeply proud of their barking and dagenham root and so they should be bark constituency be place with rich history whether it be industrial heritage include the former barking power station open by king george or the uk large council estate build after the first world war as part of the government home fit for hero scheme now barking be young and more diverse than the london and national average that be one of the thing that make it such vibrant place in which to live but it face challenge the unemployment rate in the constituency be bad than in any other london borough and average earning be much low than elsewhere shamefully of child in barking be live in poverty economic growth be critical for the whole country and for my constituent economic growth be what allow government to invest so that we can all benefit from public service school our nhs frontline service run by local authority and welfare system that value dignity for the individual economic growth mean additional investment in crucial work deliver by child service tackle youth crime and violence in our community but economic growth do more than just pay for decent public service it can deliver people good well pay job that secure roof over their head food on the table and hope for the future it be the only route out of poverty and indeed it be how my grandparent break away from the cycle of poverty that be why wholeheartedly welcome the government commitment to economic stability and growth outline in the king speech last week include plan for national wealth fund alongside new deal for work people also support the government commitment to address the housing crisis especially because it be one of the driver of poverty the average house price in barking have go up by over the last five year and rent have soar there be thousand of people in temporary accommodation and quarter of my constituent live in the under regulate private rent sector that be why the government plan to bring forward renter right bill to end section no fault eviction be so important for barking as be their commitment to speed up planning and infrastructure to get more home build the king speech be an agenda from government who be on the side of my constituent it be plan that give hope to people in this country who for too long have feel abandon hope for the future with deliverable plan to improve life be why enter politic and be sure why member on both side of the house enter politic it be why serve as council leader before come to this place and why decide to run to be member of parliament for barking politic be perhaps the great vehicle for change and it be why this place matter build more home give child well start in life with free breakfast club and more qualified teacher cut nhs waiting time lower bill with great british energy these thing matter and they will improve the life of people in my constituency they be all possible and only possible with economic growth so to the good people of barking say promise to be on your side will represent you faithfully and will fight for well future for barking so that every person have the opportunity to fulfil their potential something that be possible only if people feel safe in their community will always champion public service and will stand up for investment so that local people benefit be honour to speak in the chamber and will repay that honour by work hard for my constituent as the mp for barking it be great honour to speak in this new parliament my fifth and particularly to follow the hon member for barking nesil caliskan who speak with dazzle eloquence about her constituency but also about the importance of diversity in our democracy it be wonderful to see such diversity in the new parliament congratulate the new prime minister and his team of new ministers on that and on their laudable tone of humility and public service in the same spirit thank our leader of the opposition for both the fantastic tone in which he concede on election night and the tone in which he start his new role one can say many thing about the politic of the last few year but our leader of the opposition be not do this for money he be do it out of very deep sense of public service in the fine tradition of this country at time when so many democracy around the world be struggle democratic trust be under threat want to highlight what wonderful day it have be here because we have see the transfer of power with such peace and stability the picture from this chamber that be go around the world show how this parliament still stand for the very good of democratic civility as new generation of newly elect mps and new ministers take office with mandate for change all of we who have serve in government and see how hard it have become to deliver real last reform will wish they well in the spirit of the late great jo cox as democratically elect parliamentarian we do indeed have far more in common than divide we whatever our politic we share deep and urgent need to show that mps politic and parliament can make difference that there be serious respect for government accountability throughout this house and at the sweaty corner of the dispatch boxes and that government be not as fear so many have sadly come to believe an inevitably unaccountable bureaucratic machine that always win no matter who people vote for for my part in the field of science and technology stand ready to help this parliament and this government see through the vital work need to unleash the science technology engineering and mathematic economy mr speaker you may be ask how survive the chernobyl meltdown of conservatism in norfolk we deliver not one but three portillo

debate on immigration and home affair which be two area that be important to believe that how we tackle illegal migration will be totemic political issue in the come decade not just because of its probable global scale but because it will test whether government in the uk and elsewhere be willing to face down often well mean but misplace idea about how good to protect the right and welfare of individual while preserve community cohesion and overall fairness in society criminal justice be one of my primary reason for want to come to this place because despite recent good progress under the previous government feel that our criminal justice system do not do enough to secure justice for the victim of serious crime at the end of accord to the united nations high commissioner for refugees the number of people who have be force to flee their home stand at million irregular migration to europe be rise accord to the european union border agency frontex there be significant increase in irregular border crossing last year estimate at approximately people drive it say by economic social and security instability in part of africa over the last year frontex have detect million irregular border crossing into the eu the united states have see even big increase of migrant flow from south america the question be what to do about it first do not demonise people who make the journey that be something we should avoid people naturally want to improve their life and their family life for those arrive from conflict zone their original motivation for leave be of course to protect themselves but government and politician can not afford the luxury of blind sympathy for people in difficult circumstance we have to act rationally what be sustainable what be voter in democratic country who have to pay to provide refuge for people willing to accept support the rwanda plan because believe it be both fair and rational right now who get asylum in this country and who the british taxpayer pay to support be determine by the ability of people to make the journey into europe and the uk that be not fair believe that the agency that place people in rwanda for re home be against the plan because they fail to move with the time in understand the change nature of the issue this be no long the same problem that the european convention on human rights the european court of human rights and the refugee agency be set up to address the scale of the problem have and will continue to grow there be fear that if the uk implement such policy as australia do it will become more and more difficult for anyone to apply successfully for asylum in western country understand that concern but these agency and well mean human right advocate need to wake up to what will happen if we do not control these movement of people we will see surge in far right support and risk even more unpalatable solution provide safe and legal route be by no mean an answer whatever safe and legal route we set up will have criterion and inevitably not all people will be able to make it here on that basis the fit and young will continue to make small boat crossing to overcome that barrier so we will be right back to where we start labour may have some short term success for example on some obvious thing we may not have do when it come to tackle gang but let we look at labour track record labour members oppose all of our measure to increase sentence for people traffic and the prime minister himself oppose the deportation of foreign criminal that be not an encouraging track record wish they luck in the proposal they have put forward but none represent sustainable solution as number of eu country have recognise move people and offshore processing be the way forward pay tribute to the good progress we make on crime and justice in the previous government we introduce whole life tariff for premediated child murder we introduce harper law mandatory life sentence for the manslaughter of emergency service worker importantly we reform labour halfway release bring it up to two third for the most serious offender there be no doubt that the pandemic the associated court backlog and the increase of thousand of prisoner be keep on remand have make other difficult decision necessary take the justice secretary at her word when she say these be temporary solution although if she have sunsette they she might have have more credibility however send she my goodwill more generally there be an intellectual snobbery towards people who think the punishment of offender be public good positive thing that be necessary for the functioning of our society in my experience the ministry of justice be happy to focus on the experience of victim but not so much on whether they actually get justice will continue to campaign and push this government as do the last government to move the whole life sentence for child murder away from just significant premeditate child murder to all child murder we will all have be horrify by story of parent murder their own child very often not in premeditated circumstance think people like that deserve to face justice with whole life order will also campaign on the use of life sentence the term be misleading often report as jail for life when it almost never be which be an insult to victim those be my priority will welcome the new government progress in those area but will be there as sceptical champion for victim of crime along the way this morning we wake to the horrifying confirmation that violence against woman and girl in the uk be endemic the national police statement detail that there be offence record each day but let we remember that will be the tip of the iceberg for example of woman do not come forward to report rape to the police and many offence will not even be recognise as such by the victim because of the deep seat misogyny in this country the system as it currently stand fail woman and girl what we need now be root and branch change in march the now prime minister promise to halve violence against woman and girl if labour win office he say he would put domestic abuse specialist in police control room and set up dedicated court for rape trial be proud that in the king speech the prime minister be live up to his promise in my government propose bills be reassure to see specific measure to tackle misogyny from teach child about healthy relationship and consent to put rape victim back at the heart of our criminal justice system until now rape conviction rate have be appallingly low total of rape be record by the police in but by the end of that year charge have be just and the average wait time for rape case to get to court be day that should shame we all be hopeful that the plan to introduce specialist rape court to fast track case will make the change and support they on that note wish to take moment to thank the victim and survivor as well as the past and present victims commissioner for the hard work that they have do in campaigning to make these necessary change thank my government for act on my campaign to stop register sex offender from change their name and greatly look forward to work with those on the front bench to close all legal loophole that allow dangerous sex offender to slip through the net follow many year of fight alongside inspirational survivor include della and the safeguarding alliance be optimistic that we be finally nearly there with della law now turn to topic that need all of our attention child protection safeguarding should start with every parent and every child have access to sure start unfortunately most people be not automatically bear to be good parent but sure start can give they the support and encouragement that they need to become one early intervention be always the good and cheap solution urge the government to rebuild this inspirational offer after the tories try to demolish it one centre at time welcome the home secretary plan to introduce statutory definition of child criminal exploitation this be something that have be campaign on for many year and could never understand why the previous government resist it until now there have be multiple definition result in confused and fragmented response by authority between and more than child be identify as at risk of or victim of child criminal exploitation hope to work with the government to ensure that the new statutory definition be in line with international standard of child trafficking not just an extension of the adult definition for too long we have see the abuse of child victim be misinterpret as choice child can never consent to their abuse or exploitation wish to end where start with labour commitment to halve violence against woman and girl urge my government to seize this moment and to be bold and ambitious we owe woman and girl more than just lip service they deserve real tangible action stand ready to assist as friendly critic but also as help hand call shockat adam to make his maiden speech thank you mr deputy speaker for call to speak in this debate it be an honour to follow the hon member for rotherham sarah champion who speak on subject on which we can all agree safeguard our woman and child there have be many excellent contribution today and it be an honour to follow each and every one of they in my

shape it would be fair to say that no matter where be in the world there be corner of foreign field that be forever leicester the vibrancy the diversity and occasionally the complete rawness of the city be the backdrop of my upbringing remember very well as child those free small cold bottle of milk that use to get at school remember very well when it be steal from as well remember embark on my life journey with friend from all different creed colour religion and no religion and we make life for ourselves in this amazing country remember also moment of racism one that come to mind be with my late mother we be in park and be set upon by group of people who hurl abuse and foul thing include language and object in our direction but those incident be supersede by kindness love and understanding from the great people of this country as the young child by distance be often refer to by my family member as the mistake but my mother always refer to as miracle and ever since then begin to believe it my mother who do not get the opportunity of formal education in her lifetime ensure all her child make the most of what this country have to offer it be this mother who when suggest when grow bit old that want to study history at university look at as if be about to become history so like dutiful child do optometry and that bring to here have check the archive and it appear be only the second optometrist to have ever become an mp so hope can bring little of my professional skill to help the house to focus on what matter and not be myopic in our decision making with laser like reflection believe we can bring vision to matter before we and not make real spectacle of ourselves but the serious point be this with well usage of optometrist our gp service and our pharmaceutical colleague we can ease the burden on secondary care in our hospital we all need to work join up and together as we be on the topic of health at this juncture would like to pay tribute to my predecessor jon ashworth shadow health secretary for more than five year before latterly taking on the shadow paymaster role he have the honour before of represent the wonderful leicester south constituency in his maiden speech in he say it perfectly be privileged to represent constituency of huge diversity vibrancy and tolerance and while we must never be complacent our community generally live harmoniously together we be part of city renowne across the world for welcome incomer family have come from across the globe to make their home in leicester south our diversity ethnicity enrich

earn as dedicated champion for our city talk of champion leicester be the city of champion another miracle be from the city that defy all the odd in the season when leicester city become premier league champion prove again that miracle can happen have be diehard fan ever since be child when one of our favourite son gary lineker be still on the bench we have the tigers for our rugby force and the foxes for the cricket whilst the rider be usually top of the court in basketball and in mark selby we have snooker world champion but on serious note we must invest in sport facility not only to continue this rich tradition but to give our youth opportunity to improve their physical and mental wellbeing and occupy their time in positive pursuit too many of my young constituent tell they have nothing to do and we must give they that opportunity young people also bear the brunt of the housing crisis and in leicester we face overcrowd and waiting list of over six year bad than some london borough we urgently need more affordable home leicester another miracle be where we find the remain of the last plantagenet king the bone of richard iii have be lie undisturbed for over year until they be discover under car park in please do come and visit he at our beautiful cathedral we be friendly bunch regardless of what you may have read and hear about we to quote shakespeare my heart be ten time light than my look my city be united city we celebrate all religious festival christmas diwali vaisakhi even the caribbean carnival with equal vigour and have live in harmony for over half century however in recent year fracture have appear sow by those who wish to divide we often by weaponise language understand that our isle have finite resource but we must always have infinite empathy infinite sympathy and an infinite vocabulary to build bridge not to destroy they in the word of the great muslim sufi poet rumi we must raise our word not our voice it be rain that bring forth flower not thunder during my campaign be humble think know my city but really do not within my city there be an underbelly shadow city within city while use to speak about people who have conflict between eating and heating during my campaign meet they food bank at on tuesday morning have over people queue and be tell that be one of the quiet day they have ever have we must tackle the cost of live crisis and reduce the wealth inequality in our country it be not ethical or sustainable for any civilised nation to go on that way one poignant incident from my campaigning be when knock at house and lady peer through partially open door could not see her whole face but see enough to see life of sadness and tragedy she explain that she have have relatively successful life but something have happen at work little bit of bullying and she go into depression cycle and never really recover she say to will vote for you if you can do one of two thing what do she ask she say if you could just plant tree so can see it that would make smile and if you could get fountain so can see some water trickle vote for you forever it be important to remember that it be the simple thing that people want and that make the big difference to their life they want someone to speak up for they in these corridor of power to speak about the injustice in the world to give voice to those who do not have one who have no might authority or power whether that be the forget in yemen the victim of conflict in sudan or the victim of the ongoing devastation in palestine regardless of where they be in the world will always endeavour to speak truth to power and demand that this new government take action for the poor and dispossess not just the powerful finally if my campaign ever have catchphrase it would be the chinese proverb that say the good time to plant tree be year ago in order to enjoy its beauty its shade and its fruit but the next good time be today we must plant that seed of unity equality and justice now to ensure that our future generation can enjoy the fruit of friendship fairness and peace call brian leishman to make his maiden speech thank the hon member for leicester south shockat

kinglassie and cardenden and the village of benarty to lochgelly and kelty those and other community in the constituency have their own history and priority but so many be link by their proud connection to the mining industry that be why the decision by this government to end the injustice of the miner pension scheme so that fund in the scheme be keep for its beneficiary will be so

have the high number of deprive community in fife which be why we have to realise the ambition for the area and increase employment through expansion in renewable it be vital that uk ministers work

attention to such as the damaging impact of vat on school the taxing of education be of huge concern in my constituency which have many mainstream and special educational need independent school they would also wish to mention the loss of green belt protection and the decision of an incoming government to prioritise the deregulation of the green belt rather than build the million home that already have plan permission in our country on the decision to press ahead with gb energy those of we with background in local government know that it be policy model that bring the city of nottingham and bristol to the very edge of bankruptcy we will hold the government to account to ensure that gb energy do not do to the united kingdom what the decision of those labour council to press ahead with those project do to the capacity of local authority to deliver vital public service as well as increase bill for vulnerable household the main theme of today debate be immigration and home affair have serve briefly as parliamentary private secretary in the ministry of justice in the previous parliament welcome the tone of many thing that have be say about criminal justice in particular hope to see

particular under the previous government but we will be hold the government to account and mayor khan to account for the fact that his neglect of the suburb have leave many of our constituent concern about the availability of police team which in theory should be there but all too often seem to be abstract for other duty the measure to protect shopworker need to be part of that context of the reform of how we deal with shoplifting to ensure that anyone who work in retail or own business in retail enjoy the protection from our police force and our criminal law that they rightly deserve on illegal migration there be lot of noise and fuss but hope the government will continue patiently with the work do previously in particular with the authority in france have meet the people do that work both here in the uk and on the french side to bring to justice criminal gang the successful prosecution achieve of those involve in set up smuggling pay tribute to the work of the bbc in shed light on the complexity of the international gang highlight how often the kingpin seek to find refuge in place such as iraq where they be beyond the reach not just of the criminal law in the united

embrace restorative justice something that know from personal experience can have transformative effect on victim as it do on my family with the add bonus of dramatically curtail rate of recidivism there be much more would like to say for example about the need to restore neighbourhood policing which as the home secretary say early be decimate under the previous government somewhat more parochially there be an urgent need to guarantee the long term future of wimbledon police station which six year after my judicial review quash the mayor of london decision to close it remain under

the local charity who provide essential support to the many people in need food bank have be mention by several hon member on both side of the house during today debate for if anything be an indictment of the past year it be that food bank have become part of the british way of life the food bank that serve fulham today feed more people in one month than it do in the whole of when it start at the food bank that serve chelsea demand have go up by since it open its door in people who be in work be use food bank as well as child and pensioner the demand for they be grow and poverty

the time they promise to give the hospital floor by floor refurbishment it desperately need modernisation and rebuilding and they promise to do so by but then they break their promise another problem face my constituent be that thames water constantly dump sewage into the thames by chelsea and fulham last week alone it just chuck the stuff in for nearly hour there have be no regulation and no proper control over the last year the wonderful houseboat community down by the river in chelsea face an existential threat from predatory secretive landlord and will be do more to stick up for that community too have mention the king road and its resident be very worried about the huge office block spoil the area marks spencer seem to have become property developer not just purveyor of sausage sandwich and underwear my constituent be also worried about crime and the lack of neighbourhood police high price and rent be push family and young people out of the area and as it have be so incredibly difficult to build social housing over the past year thousand of my constituent be live in overcrowded condition or be wait year to be offer secure genuinely affordable home this be all in chelsea and fulham against that backdrop the good news for my constituent be that we now have labour government who be determined to renew the country we have new approach we be focus on grow our economy and we be thank goodness reset our european relationship which be very much welcome by my constituent chelsea and fulham be one of the most pro european constituency in the country the other

people can actually afford to live as the government begin their journey of repair and rebuild our country come back to the word of good friend of mine phil storey who run the food bank that serve fulham he say to the other day we want to stop people ever need food bank the day we can close our door because we be no long need be the day dream of make this pledge to my constituent as the member of parliament for chelsea and fulham work with the labour government will do all can to strengthen our economy to build fairer safe and kind society and to bring phil dream close to reality congratulate the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman on his maiden speech it be great privilege to serve in this place and welcome he also congratulate the government front benchers as they take on their ministerial responsibility will focus on three bit of legislation mention in the king speech that have generate interest among my constituent in chesham and amersham the first be the water special measure bill because the liberal democrats have lead the charge on call for tough penalty for water company that dump sewage in our river and fail their customer be therefore keen to learn more about the bill and the power it will give to ban bonus and introduce new fine resident and business in chalfont st peter spend the first half of this year struggle to cope with sewage fill floodwater some have the horrible experience of their bathroom and kitchen plug hole burp sewage into their home thames water later admit to that the cause of at least some of this sewage be bring into home be that the company tanker have release floodwater which they have pump out of another area into the wrong location overload the drain thames water response to this year various problem in different part of my constituency have be disgraceful so look forward to hear how the government will ensure that ofwat finally use its tooth and start hold the like of thames water to account the second bill in the king speech that would like to touch on be the planning and infrastructure bill represent constituency where significant amount of land be classify as green belt my constituent be keen to get definition of what grey belt mean other than poor quality and ugly there have be little detail about exactly what land would fall into that category also look forward to hear what step the government will take to ensure that any new development include the gp practice other vital service and infrastructure to support they the third announcement in the king speech that would like to talk about be the government plan to end vat exemption for independent school the issue have be raise with by several parent who send their child to independent school in order to receive additional support for special educational need and disability welcome the confirmation have receive that pupil with an education health and care plan will remain exempt from vat there be however child receive support for send in the independent sector who do not have ehcp hope that the government can offer assurance that such child will be take into account as they pursue this policy will end by mention healthcare while welcome the government focus on reduce waiting time be disappoint not to see specific mention of improve access to gp appointment because that be raise with week in week out just this weekend it be raise by resident in gerrards cross where there be no gp practice hope that with their significant mandate the government will give access to gp appointment the attention it desperately need rail in public ownership strong worker right publicly own energy supplier ban on no fault eviction and an end to the non dom tax status these be some of the key foundation to recovery that we can celebrate in this king speech after year of austerity privatisation and squeeze living standard but want to touch on few thing that be not include be pleased to support the amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for liverpool riverside kim johnson remove the two child benefit cap be the most cost effective and immediate way for our government to lift child out of poverty the notion that in the sixth large economy in the world we can not find the money have to be wrong while the taskforce be good we must make move as soon as possible to make this be reality if there be national emergency we would find the money if the level of child poverty at the moment be not national emergency do not know what be be also pleased to support the amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for coventry south zarah sultana to end the supply of arm to israel and uphold international law the government have call for ceasefire and we need to back that up with action will focus the majority of my remark on the dreadful legislative legacy on civil liberty leave behind by the previous government if we take simply the broad heading of our liberty the previous government curb the right to protest to free assembly to freedom of speech to organise in trade union and to freedom from covert operation by the state the right to vote have be supresse religious freedom be attack through the demonisation of muslims and muslim community we can not possibly pose as champion of freedom and democracy while these stain remain on our statute book in addition we should note that the previous government do nothing to correct the gross imbalance that now exist between employer and trade union with regard to worker right they promise to block the gross abuse that lead to the scandal at but do absolutely nothing they also toy with the idea of regularise the legislative mess around woman right to choose and so address issue of woman sexual and reproductive health and expand access to safe and legal abortion throughout the country we can not repeat these serial failure to act this be about what it mean to live in free society furthermore there be slew of secondary legislation rule and guidance that infringe or suppress the right of citizen there be too many to mention but be think about the covert human intelligence sources criminal conduct act the overseas operations act the elections act and the public order act run theme throughout those act be in effect to place officer of the state above the law whether they be police officer member of the armed service member of the security service or other as long as they be act under the direction of more senior officer these law severely curtail the fundamental right of citizen under these act it be officer of the state who decide what be lawful not the court remind hon and right hon member that place agent of the state above the law be almost the very definition of police state it be authoritarian and anti democratic it be not the legal basis of free and democratic society the same be true of any claim that be make that officer of the state determine the law they do not their duty be to uphold it over time would confidently expect each and every one of these piece of legislation to face legal challenge include if necessary in the european court because they be so flawed and draconian if our democracy be go to work for everyone it have to include everyone our party have already make important commitment to extend the franchise to young people by bring in automatic voter registration scrap the exclusory voter id law that the tories introduce be another urgent priority to strengthen engagement in the democratic process survey by more in common estimate that more than people be prevent from vote in the general election due to these undemocratic rule the same research show that people of colour be time more likely to be turn away let we be clear about this any law that disproportionately stop black and brown people from participate in our democracy be racist the voter id law be introduce on the pretence of tackle voter fraud yet between and there be just conviction compare that with the people block from vote at the ballot box there be so many thing that we want to see want to congratulate the prime minister on his announcement that there will be an early repeal of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act this too be an anti democratic authoritarian measure that place member of the armed force above the law the prime minister announcement on this should be model for the rest of the legislation that have mention it be also very important to look at some of the action that the previous government take they rush legislation through in very hurried way in fact they give we model for do thing in the future wish to point out that the people of this country vote against that government so let we repeal all of their awful legislation both quickly and decisively call frank mcnally to make his maiden speech it be pleasure to follow the passionate speech of my hon friend the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy come

and his staff all the very good for the future my seat have be well represent over many year but perhaps alarmingly for it have have five different mp in recent time in fact there have be new mp elect at every election since fervently hope that that tradition will come to an end at the next election also wish to pay tribute to my other predecessor and friend include hugh gaffney and of course sir tom clarke who serve this place with great distinction for year he be man knight by both his majesty the king and his holiness the pope for his service to those in the most need particularly the

by people business and public authority and be perhaps see by other national government and our economy experience catastrophic consequence from the kamikaze budget month ago welcome the legislation that have be put forward to achieve that goal that insecurity manifest itself in many different way we see million people live in poverty million of they child and million incredibly live in destitution we see insecurity of tenure and the rise of no fault eviction which be why legislation for renter right be so important and the insecurity of leasehold hence the importance of the legislation on leasehold and commonhold we see the insecurity of work the zero hour contract and the loss of right in the workplace that people suffer that be why the employment right bill will be so important it be all down to the economy what we can do with the economy in address and repair the corrosion work by austerity be so important believe the mean will now be at our disposal through the establishing of national wealth fund we have see sovereign wealth fund in many other country and what they have do to transform those country believe the legislation address pension scheme unlock the wealth that we have here will be an important contribution to that something like less than of the trillion of pension fund asset run by often very small scheme be invest in uk that be such small proportion there will be benefit for the uk but also for our wide economy above all we will address and reform planning legislation and infrastructure bring more affordable housing to our town and city particularly town such as warwick and leamington where we have relatively high property cost the king high school site right in the heart of warwick have lie dormant for five year because the developer have not get around to develop it the legislation to deliver gb energy will be so important for transform the energy mix in this country double our onshore wind treble our solar energy production and quadruple our offshore wind the great grid upgrade for which national grid have be push for so long will be so important critically it will bring down bill by an average of per household while address climate change at the same time believe that education be at the core of what we can bring along with modern industrial strategy the work be do by the education team be so important what can our university bring to this equation high education be so important and university be real dynamo generator of wealth and prosperity in our region through their scientific research the development of new material and research project and the new energy cluster this be new government of energy ambition and public service who will put country first party second call helena dollimore to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for call to make my maiden speech during this important debate on the king speech which set out the agenda of change that the country vote for and which this labour government will deliver congratulate all new member who have make maiden speech today it be the honour of my life to represent my home of hastings and rye know that you be very familiar madam deputy speaker with all that we in hastings and rye have to offer visitor especially our famous fish and chip in recent year our fisherman have work hard to keep our local fishing industry go in the most difficult of circumstance and they will always have my full support hastings and rye host the world crazy golf championship every year and we also hold the world record for the big gathering of pirate in any one place record that we try to beat every year on pirate day although one of my predecessor in represent rye be himself real pirate be relieve to say that that can not be say for many of they sally ann hart work extremely hard for our constituency and thank she in particular for her work in support of woman and child flee domestic abuse legacy that hope to build on another thing that we wholeheartedly agree on be speak out about the unacceptable level of abuse and intimidation that too many member of this house have face particularly woman the plaque of the late jo cox be face we and that of sir david amess be behind they be constant and tragic reminder of where that can end also pay tribute to my labour predecessor michael foster he be well know in our area for help so many resident and for have be passionate champion for hastings and rye during his time in this house many member will know our area for very famous battle that take place in historian may still be argue about where exactly it take place but it be safe to say that it have cement our place in the history book since then we have continue to play our part in british history from be immortalise in the novel the ragged trousered philanthropists to be the birthplace of television perhaps what define we most though be our community spirit underpin by our volunteer and charity who do so much our calendar be full of carnival and festival from jack in the green to bonfire night those event be make possible only by volunteer who give up their time to give back to the community and raise money for our local charity volunteer also maintain and protect so many of our amazing public space from hastings country park to rye harbour nature reserve and camber sands there be also some point of our history that we would rather forget such as the unveiling of certain stone tablet in hastings during the general election campaign by my right hon friend the member for doncaster north ed miliband that stone may have be consign to history but know that my right hon friend will be back very soon to unveil some new green energy infrastructure and that it will be long last than the stone although we have often find ourselves at the centre of historical event we have not always feel all of the benefit our road and rail infrastructure be stick in the past we may be similar distance from london as brighton be but our train take twice as long we lie at the end of the road that have be describe as the least develop in the south east of england as any driver will tell you we have the bad pothole in the country and our water infrastructure be also fail we southern water have lot to answer for in my constituency dump record level of sewage along our coastline from st leonards through hastings to fairlight pett camber sands and winchelsea beach some sewage have even come into people home and garden in my constituency and when the water pipe have fail we have face major flooding in home and the town centre and be leave without water supply for day on end be pleased to see that the water special measure bill which will start to clean up our water industry be part of this king speech the cratered state of our road and crumble water infrastructure be symbolic of how we have too often be forget by westminster life expectancy be low than the national average trend that have get bad over the past year people wait long for an ambulance in my constituency than anywhere else in the south east of england and the situation be particularly bad in our village and rural area such as winchelsea where people wait minute on average when have stroke or heart attack that be why this government plan to cut nhs waiting time can not come soon enough as seaside destination our area have benefit hugely from tourism but we be also at the sharp end of the housing crisis with spiral rent and simply not enough home be build too many of my constituent be leave in poor quality rental accommodation whether by southern housing or private landlord that be why so welcome the measure in this king speech to get britain build again build more home and give all renter more protection this government have mission to break down the barrier to opportunity that be sorely need in my constituency where almost of child be grow up in poverty and over half our young people be leave school without the essential qualification of grade in english and math how we treat our child say lot about we as society before join this house have the privilege of see that up close in many different country as an aid worker with save the children it be always child who suffer the most in war and conflict have sit with young mum in yemen hold their starve baby so hungry that they do not have the energy to cry and have hear harrowing story from rohingya woman who have flee ethnic cleansing and sexual violence at the hand of the myanmar military always promise those woman that would share their story with the world and my time in this place will be no different we be at time in history when more child be grow up in conflict than ever before rightly much focus have be devote recently to the appalling event in israel and palestine there too it be child bear the brunt of war we must redouble our effort to bring about peaceful solution to all these conflict and must remember that all the global issue we face from climate change to migration can only be solve by work across border with our international ally and through strong multilateral institution such as the united nations just as have be so inspire by the woman have meet live in some of the tough place on earth also want to acknowledge some of the woman whose shoulder stand on close to home madam deputy speaker know speak for many labour members when say how much we miss your sister the late great baroness margaret mcdonagh hon member hear hear she always have such wise counsel to offer we and that be the reason why many of we sit on these benches today also thank my family and friend for all the support they have give in get to this place this king speech will begin to deliver the change and renewal that hastings and rye vote for look forward to work hard for all my constituent across hastings and rye and deliver that much need change it be an absolute privilege to follow my hon friend the member for hastings and rye helena dollimore watch early as she be polish her edstone joke outside the chamber and it be deliver with aplomb be hop for colleague sake that have to make this contribution to the king speech debate only once believe do thing twice be not what it be crack up to be either way it make wonderful change to be on the government benches to speak in king speech debate in which for once stability eclipse chaos renewal surpasse decay and hope trump despair let tell my new colleague that it be not usually like this at least it have not be for the past nine or year maybe long too often we have be here make speech that mourn the erosion of our democracy and our right at work and that can only bemoan the continual and unceasing scapegoating of our community the destruction of our river the undermining of our judicial system the betrayal of international human right and the deepening of climate crisis but not today because this king speech be veritable cornucopia of progressive policy pregnant with the potential to unpick decade of drift and deterioration would not try to say that after couple of pint there be of course caveat announcement on the two child benefit cap and arm export licence to israel be but two issue we await to hear more on in the near future in the interim however for one welcome the announcement of our anti child poverty taskforce if do properly it have the potential to lift thousand of child from my constituency and million beyond out of hunger and hardship and to give all our child the start in life they deserve start deny they by the last government however we could go far we could build new institution and put power in the hand of those who need it most one of the lesson learn watch conservative government close down labour much love and beloved sure start centre be that if we give community the ability to wealth build and thus help themselves the institution build can not simply be switch off by an incoming government hostile to poverty reduction the late and great robin cook understand this he lament labour government who never change the system because they think they do need to and when they lose they have no power to change it the marginality of this parliament and the rise spectre of right wing authoritarianism demand that we legislate as if this be one term government and one that could easily be follow by government with little respect for democracy tolerance progressive value or even human right in this age of anger and perma crisis policy delivery be no long enough transformative change empowerment and new institution to deliver be what be need to future proof society against the shock to come we do not have to look far for example of what they could look like the nhs be an institution that be the close thing to socialism this country have ever attain and it be the reason most brit give as to why they be proud to be british let we repower and rebuild our local authority democratic institution that for too long have be undervalue underfunde and strip of responsibility let we redouble our effort to strengthen trade union institution that push power back to people in the workplace such institution both new and old will help undo year of democratic erosion and make people feel empower over their own life if we do this right it will pull the rug from under the foot of the hatemonger and authoritarian because they thrive on anger bear of powerlessness sense of betrayal and vacuum of purpose people orientate democratic institutional power blow they away want to conclude with this observation the true risk to this country be not the river of blood as some would have we believe but rather river of excrement and river run dry in only few decade time my constituency might not have drink water because of combination of the climate crisis and corporate corruption in the form of price gouging and criminal level of under investment immigration and asylum do not lead we here any more than membership of the eu do fail institution the erosion of democracy and economic failure bring we here it be that our government must fix so let we get to it yesterday and today have witness number of maiden speech from both side of the house there have be some excellent contribution which must say be absolutely wonderful to listen to would like to thank the resident of the newly draw constituency of birmingham hall green and moseley who have put their trust in it be privilege and great honour to speak in the king speech debate today like most of my constituent be excite by the legislative agenda it set out labour have hit the ground run with bold plan for the transformation of our country that believe will get we back on track after year of chaos it be because of that promise that want to speak to several area cover in the king speech first be proud of labour commitment to the most ambitious house building programme in generation particularly in term of social housing this programme must be design and implement in way that address the significant regional disparity in housing provision my constituent will be thankful for labour approach to youth provision from tough measure to tackle antisocial behaviour and knife crime to educational reform through skills england believe over the course of this parliament our young people will receive the support and training they need to take advantage of every opportunity afford to they the newly outline child wellbee bill will undoubtedly make huge impact on family in my constituency where child poverty be at unprecedented level the provision of free breakfast club as well as the development of new child poverty strategy be both welcome and necessary after year of deprivation this bill will also provide extra support to child with special educational need who need the great support and have previously be deny it while there be argument in favour of retain the two child benefit cap it be also clear that we can go much far and lift hundred and thousand of child out of poverty the significance of lift this cap for the most vulnerable in our society can not be overstate and hope there be movement on this in coming month be particularly glad at the direction take by this government towards regional and local government as we all know birmingham be face an unprecedented financial crisis put at risk value service such as library and support to child and family as well as infrastructure and investment in the limited time available today will not be expand on what can be do to save those service but debate and discussion will take place through other mean that bring to amendment put my name forward to be add but for whatever technical reason it be not add want briefly to address some of the newly elect independent in this house throughout the election they denounce the labour party with divisive and harmful rhetoric luckily we be now able to measure their word against their action and unsurprisingly they be find lack in sign labour amendment labour the party of genocide labour the party of be the rhetoric play out in the election campaign when many candidate especially woman be harass and intimidate today those independent sit on the opposition benches but they be willing to sign labour amendment please go back and explain to your constituent the rhetoric that be play out why have you now join force with labour members by sign amendment be you now say that labour be the right party will the hon gentleman give way no will not you need to go back to your constituent and explain that will not take any intervention order draw the hon member attention to the fact that when we use the word you in this house we be refer to the chair apologise for not use the correct word and with that be out of time thank you apologise to all hon member who have not be call to speak today but we must now start the wind up call the shadow minister may start by send my congratulation and those of my party to the hon and right hon member who have be elect today the hon member for sussex weald ms ghani and for bradford south judith cummins and the right hon member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes congratulate they all be sure they will fulfil their role as deputy speakers with great integrity and honour turn briefly to some of the maiden speech of which there have be the most extraordinary number be grateful to have sit through many of they although perhaps not all my hon friend the member for fylde mr snowden bring fantastic previous service to the house although hope he be not bite by another dog must also pay tribute to his wife caroline courage and his campaign also cite the hon member for worthe west dr cooper who be not shy of cake although that may not be the public service or public health message that she wish to bring it be one that share be delighted that the hon member for gateshead central and whickham mark ferguson highlight the glasshouse which be indeed at the cultural heart of our nation the hon member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae give move account of tragic loss and his campaign for recognise baby loss be one that will be back across the whole house the hon member for clacton nigel farage surprise we all by actually discuss the subject of the debate the direct access of the hon member for darlington lola mcevoy to the chancellor will no doubt raise huge hope in her constituency the addiction of the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice to ice cream suggest that he should team up with the hon member for darlington suggest they might one day be friend the hon member for bassetlaw jo white do belong here no matter what she say and no matter what anybody else say the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde teach we the meaning of pier envy which be new one on the baby girl of the hon member for barking nesil caliskan will no doubt bring enormous joy but if my experience be anything to go by enormous sleepless night too no doubt she too will be vote in the lobby very soon must pay enormous tribute to the work of the hon member for ashford sojan joseph in healthcare as child be frequent flyer and user of the william harvey hospital so be grateful that he continue to serve in that community the hon member for leicester south shockat adam hide king or find one be not sure quite which the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman make passionate defence of the need for domestic energy production and share that view enormously be sorry he do not share it with the right hon member for doncaster north ed miliband but perhaps he will inform he well the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson have kind word to say about our friend alex chalk who serve the house and that constituency with great integrity and decency my hon friend the member for bridgwater sir ashley fox recall the last battle on british soil and be now seek to power our country with nuclear energy as he will know well this country only ever build nuclear power station under conservative government the hon member for glenrothes and mid fife richard baker commit to work on disability and that sentiment will be share by many here the campaigning technique of the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler be undoubtedly original the hon member for coatbridge and bellshill frank mcnally can only hope to break the track record of get second term in that seat and even those of we on the opposition benches might be supportive of that the history of piracy of the hon member for hastings and rye helena dollimore will no doubt worry the whip something rotten be sure she will fail to put they at their ease certainly not so early in the parliament the fashion advice of the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman would be welcome by those of we who miss the but he no doubt will be contribute thank he for his kind word to our friend greg hands who serve the constituency so well turn to the king speech rather than the maiden speech the king after all have give one himself sadly he do not choose his own word and be not sure they be the one he would have choose it be however as ever pleasure to be speak across the dispatch box from the hon member for wallasey dame angela eagle and wish she the very good of luck in her new role become labour immigration minister must be strange experience after all barbara roche one of her predecessor write that she be appal to be appoint immigration minister in the blair government one of barbara contemporary david blunkett famously say that there be no obvious limit to the number of migrant who could settle in the united kingdom suspect we will not get such frank honesty from this prime minister or this home secretary however in their heart suspect that neither of they truly believe in control legal and illegal migration the hon member for wallasey have my sympathy it can not be easy to defend government who have already scrap the deterrent that work lose the commander of the border strategy unit and now all but offer an amnesty oh dear these day be difficult be they not no doubt she have already read the advice of her frontline officer because the national crime agency be extremely clear it have be task by that government to tackle criminal gang but it have already say that we need an effective deterrence agreement and since it have publicly point out that no country have ever stop people traffic upstream in foreign country without deportation scheme be certain that it will not have mince its word in private rise the hon lady will get plenty of time in just moment despite that the home secretary have promise the british people result and urge we to put faith in her plan have long hear and listen to the right hon lady who have be friend for many year so let ask the question put yesterday by my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse if god forbid the home secretary be wrong and the number rise know wonder will never happen what will she do will she take responsibility and resign or will she reach for the old blair brown playbook that be the golden thread run through the king speech and instead farm out the blame set up new quango pretend it be not her problem and hope that it all go away be sorry to tell you madam deputy speaker that have listen to the debate over the last few day it seem that labour approach to illegal immigration be absolutely typical of how it plan to govern this be government who will be overbearing when they should stand back and absent when they should stand tall they will be too hesitant in defend our country from her enemy abroad too control or uncontrolling of our border fail to protect decent people from criminal but they will be all too willing to creep into every corner of our personal life this be government who seem determined to prioritise left wing ideology over the interest of the british people be afraid that be what labour do that be what be happen in education where the government be roll back the quiet revolution that have make our school some of the good in the western hemisphere in energy where they claim that they will reduce bill by create an energy company that do not generate energy and in skill where the good they can offer generation that aspire be another bloated regulator those be the policy of government who value job for bureaucrat over result and ideological purity over the wellbeing of the british people be afraid that the economy can not afford such ideology we need honesty in the challenge that we face despite the chancellor attempt to talk down the position that she have find herself in that be indeed what she have inherit despite the selective memory on the government benches we know the fact we have the low inflation and the fast grow economy of any country the deficit be down unemployment be down and the economy be grow all despite global pandemic and war rag in europe that recovery be now at risk labour talk about growth but business be already groan at the propose increase in regulation that the government be propose and be fearful of the tax rise that we be all expect from the chancellor and that she be effectively roll the carpet for this autumn the change in workplace regulation will not protect new employee they will simply put business off hire they the trouble with labour plan be that we know that however well mean they be they always lead to the same outcome while conservative see industry as the source of our prosperity labour just view it as something to be tax it think that entrepreneur be not grafter but greedy and it can not see that drive and energy bring opportunity to whole community not just to an individual or company to that say this just as our security should not be take for grant neither should our wealth or prosperity no one owe we living or good life if we punish those who create job and make it hard or more expensive to run business this country will get poor it will not happen overnight it will creep up on we with investment not make business idea not take forward and entrepreneur move abroad little by little those good intention will lead to well predict consequence where we should be go for growth labour be design state of stagnation the direction that the government have choose to take be all too clear state that be weak on defence weak on protect our border and weak on maintain order whether in school or on the street yet that state presume to tell we how to live our life offer we less choice about how we educate our child run our business rent our home and do our job in only few week the government have already show themselves unable to commit to the step need to keep we safe unable to secure our border and unwilling to let the british economy thrive the labour party talk good game but action speak louder than word and its action so far have be those of party determine to put ideology over this country interest hon member would not think that the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat be in the government that preside over parliament in which living standard be low at the end than at the beginning they would not think that this be man who preside over hash of government that have eight home secretaries five prime ministers and education secretary all within few year to listen to he hon member would think that he be still on the government benches lecture

shall be no sitting in westminster hall until tuesday september lucy powell commercial sexual exploitation motion make and question propose that this house do now jones there have be huge advance in the battle for woman equality in recent decade but on some issue we have go backwards chief among they be commercial sexual exploitation interruption order ask that member leave the chamber quietly out of respect for the adjournment debate give someone money accommodation food job or other service on the condition that they perform sex act be sexual exploitation and abuse yet the global trade in sexual exploitation perpetrate primarily against woman and girl be big than ever before sex trafficking be the most profitable form of modern slavery in the world while violent misogynistic pornography be consume on an unparalleled scale mostly by man this be not an accident and it be not inevitable we could and should have do so much more to protect woman and girl instead the past year have be veritable golden age for pimp and pornographer do my hon friend agree that under the united nations protocol on trafficking victim do not need to have travel in vehicle in order for traffic offence to have be commit yet under the uk modern slavery act they do this mean that exploiter who be not actually move victim in vehicle from one place to another be not be prosecute as trafficker it would make huge difference if there be parity between the two piece of legislation to make sure that trafficking be justly prosecute thank my hon friend for her intervention know that the minister be listen and will likely agree with she as do multimillion pound pimp website have be allow to operate freely man who drive demand for sex trafficking by pay for sex have be leave to abuse with impunity while the most popular pornography website in the country have be free to peddle video of rape and sexual abuse commend the hon lady for bring this debate forward she be active on this subject when she be on the opposition benches and commend she for that to be fair so be the minister in her place tonight so be quite sure that whatever we ask for the minister will respond in very positive fashion and be glad about that do the hon lady not agree that we must be at pain to ensure that the open border between northern ireland and the republic be not use as trafficking channel would she join in ask the secretary of state for northern ireland to meet the relevant republic of ireland minister to discuss and agree how we can collectively ensure that this be not back door to abuse and misuse thank the hon member for his contribution because have be shadow minister for northern ireland and from work with women aid in northern ireland know that this be real problem welcome his offer to join he in meet the secretary of state for northern ireland and the minister to discuss this far and thank he very much for his intervention the previous government stand by and let this happen which be shocking abdication of duty woman and girl deserve so much well from the government be look forward to see this new government step up and protect woman and girl from commercial sexual exploitation and in this debate will set out how first of all let we be clear prostitution be violence against woman man who pay for sex be not regular consumer harmlessly avail worker of their service healthy non abusive sexual relationship require both party to mutually and freely want to have sex offer somebody money or food or place to stay in return for their perform sex act be sexual coercion it be simply not possible to commodify sexual consent as the united nations special rapporteur on violence against woman and girl have state prostitution be intrinsically link to different form of violence against woman and girl and constitute form of violence in and of itself most woman exploit in prostitution be highly vulnerable before even enter the sex trade and suffer severe consequence as result home office report note that approximately of woman in prostitution in the united kingdom start be pay for sex act before they be year old while up to of woman in street prostitution be believe to be problematic drug user and my hon friend the member for neath and swansea east carolyn harris have meet these woman and see the struggle that they have in swansea city centre and know that they be there to fuel their drug use they be pimp out and it be heartbreaking this be how use my politic when think about the most vulnerable people in society think about the woman who be cry because they have have their child take away from they permanently they be not able to make end meet and they have to be take out by their pimp to earn in order to feed themselves and to live their life in basic way really do believe that we should always think about those woman when we talk about woman in this house want to read the word of crystal survivor who have speak out about her experience of prostitution she say become involved in prostitution in my early twenty courtesy of my then boyfriend now use the word pimp my body always hurt from the constant rough sex get jaw ache from blow job after blow job group stuff be especially harrowing develop post traumatic stress disorder get flashback and nightmare when could sleep the addiction and the prostitution go together sell myself to fund my habit and could do it sober it be vicious cycle too often in discussion about prostitution and sex trafficking there be silence when it come to the people who perpetrate this kind of abuse man who pay for sex so it be only right that also read their word today here be what one man write in forum for sex buyer about woman he pay to perform sex act on he this be classic case of the pretty one do have to work hard she polish and her english be not good be remind of the smiths song girlfriend in coma all the while she seem completely disinterested and mechanical finally decide to fuck she in mish all the while she keep her face turn to one side apologise for the language madam deputy speaker as one of her first act in government urge the minister to recognise the violence that woman such as crystal endure and the harmful action of sex buyer by add prostitution to the government tackle violence against woman and girl strategy just as the scottish government have do so what do we know about sex buyer we know that of man in the uk report have pay for sex in the previous five year and we know that the level of demand for prostitution vary over time and place that be because man who pay to sexually exploit woman be not helplessly react to uncontrollable sexual urge they be make choice and that choice be influence by range of factor include the risk of criminal sanction importantly we also know that the harm perpetrate when man pay for sex be not restrict to the individual woman he exploit as the home affairs committee conclude last year sex buyer fuel demand for trafficking the cohort of man who create demand for the prostitution trade be the same cohort that create the demand drive the trafficking of woman into that trade so we have group of man perpetrate type of violence against woman that financially incentivise further violence against woman that should prompt robust legal response from government that hold sex buyer accountable for the severity of their action but that be not the legal response we have in england and wales there be loose patchwork of law relate to prostitution with no consistent objective underpin they third party facilitation of prostitution be illegal in some circumstance yet permit in other victim of sexual exploitation face criminal sanction for solicit in public place while individual who pay for sex face criminal sanction only if they kerb crawl or pay for sex with an individual subject to force even then the law be very rarely enforce the consequence of this legal fudge be all around we hide in plain sight across the country vulnerable woman be be advertise online and move around network of so call pop up brothel organised crime group dominate this ruthless trade exploit predominantly non uk national woman let give snapshot of what be happen over month period leicestershire police visit brothel encounter woman of whom be romanian in bristol the police foundation identify brothel over two year period over three quarter of the brothel display link to organise crime group and of the woman in they be non british national in city after city woman be be traffic and exploit and for one overriding reason there be man willing and able to pay to abuse they this have to stop it be just unbearable mia de faoite survivor of prostitution who now train the police on how to combat commercial sexual exploitation point to how we should do this she say prostitution be what most people imagine it to be violent and dangerous in the six year that be involve endure gang rape and three separate rape the only country in europe who be make substantial impact in the fight against modern day slavery be the one who have acknowledge and face the cause the demand mia be right and urge the minister to listen to she grow number of country and state be wake up to the fact that without demand from sex buyer there would be no supply of woman into prostitution and sex trafficking by criminalise pay for sex and decriminalise victim of sexual exploitation the governments of ireland france sweden norway and canada have shift the burden of criminality off victim and on to perpetrator england and wales must be the next country add to that list sweden be the first nation to adopt demand reduction legislation in afford we more than two decade of evidence the result be stark demand have drop public attitude have transform and trafficker be be deter the most recent research find that of man in sweden have pay for sex just of they have pay for sex in the previous month the small proportion record in two decade and the low level in europe have see at first hand how agency collaborate to implement sweden sex purchase act have meet police and support worker there task with hold sex buyer accountable and assist victim co ordinate multi agency working back up by strong political leadership have be key to translate the legislation into real change on the ground those who want to preserve the right of man to pay for sex have claim that outlaw this abusive practice would simply drive the prostitution trade underground make it hard to identify victim however as study commission by the european commission conclude there be logical fallacy at the heart of that argument sex buying be largely opportunistic and rely on advertising sex buyer have get to be able to find woman to sexually exploit and the police can look at exactly the same advert that they do if sex buyer can find woman be exploit so can the police solely go after sex buyer be not sufficient to stop sex trafficking however we also have to crack down on the pimp website that enable and profit from this abhorrent trade pimp website be commercial online platform dedicate solely or partly to advertising woman for prostitution they function like mass online brothel make it as easy to order woman to exploit as it be to order takeaway despite it be illegal to place prostitution advert in phone box the same advert can be legally publish for profit on website our law have not keep pace with technological change and pimp have get rich as result as the scottish parliament cross party group on commercial sexual exploitation find in its inquiry into pimp website small number of highly lucrative website dominate the market centralise and concentrate demand online the site make it simple and fast for trafficker to advertise their victim and connect with their so call customer base in town and city across the uk shamefully the previous government not only fail to stop pimp website from operate but collaborate with they since home office official have meet time with vivastreet one of the big website advertising prostitution what have be the result of that collaboration with mass prostitution ring the home affairs committee conclusion be the threat pose by website advertising prostitution the continue failure of their owner to implement even the most basic safeguard against pimping and trafficking and the sheer scale of trafficking for sexual exploitation they facilitate be at total odd with the national crime agency and home office decision to collaborate with they we find this public partnership work inexplicable particularly give the total absence of evidence that it have lead to reduction in the scale of trafficking facilitate by these website and the flagrant facilitation of trafficking enable by for instance single individual be allow to advertise multiple woman for prostitution the home affairs committee the all party parliamentary group on commercial sexual exploitation and the scottish parliament cross party group on commercial sexual exploitation have be unite in their conclusion that in order to bust the business model of sex trafficking we have to drag our anti pimp law into the century by make it criminal offence to enable or profit from the prostitution of another person whether that take place online or offline hand in hand with that anti pimp law we need cross government strategy to help survivor exit sexual exploitation and rebuild their life that be because in order to stop sexual exploitation we have to end impunity for pimp and punter and provide support not sanction for victim turn to pornography and the action that we need to finally start tackle the rampant commercial sexual exploitation on pornography website as well as their wide harm groundbreake inquiry into the pornography trade by the all party parliamentary group on commercial sexual exploitation conclude that we can not simply end the epidemic of male violence against woman and girl without confront the role that pornography play in fuel sexual objectification and sexual violence the fact that government have hitherto fail to tackle even the most egregious abuse perpetrate by this predatory industry be not because that have prove too difficult but because there have not be sufficient political will that have to change now the finding of the group inquiry be extensive and unequivocal urge the minister to study they carefully will highlight just few first pornography consumption fuel sexual violence there be extensive evidence from experimental non experimental longitudinal and cross sectional study of that research indicate that pornography influence viewer so call sexual script shape their understanding expectation and decision in relation to sexual behaviour pornography also serve to dehumanise and sexually objectify woman foster attitude that underpin violence against woman and girl secondly illegal content be freely accessible on mainstream pornography website lawlessness characterise the online pornography trade with film feature child sexual abuse rape and traffic victim find on some of the uk most heavily visit site thirdly the inquiry conclude that sexual coercion be inherent in the commercial production of pornography will quote the word of alia dewees survivor of pornography and traffic who now work to support other survivor alia be just when she be first pay to perform in pornography give evidence to the all party group she recall when do not want to consent when be feel uncomfortable unsafe or unwilling do not have the freedom to leave that shoot without repercussion do have the freedom to leave and know that be go to be sue for breach of contract alia experience that immense pressure to participate in film sex act because on previous date she have sign legal contract to do so that be commercial sexual exploitation like too many other woman she be subject to horrifying level of sexual abuse in this so call industry she bravely speak out there be simple practical step that ministers can take now to rein in the lawless activity of pornography site and implement basic safeguard such measure should include make the regulation of pornography consistent across the online and offline sphere as recommend by the british board of film classification and require online platform access from the uk to verify that every individual feature in pornographic content on their site be an adult and give permission for the content to be publish there safeguard must include give individual who feature in pornographic material access from the uk the legal right to withdraw their consent to material in which they feature be publish or distribute far we have the power to make that burden little light by give individual who feature on pornography website the legal right to have that content take down would like to pay tribute to the ministers on the front bench labour vote in support of the amendment table by the now minister of state at the home department my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson but it be block by the conservative government now that labour be in power hope that we will see vital safeguard in government bill soon in opposition labour could only use word in the fight against commercial sexual exploitation now we can use deed this government must shift power out of the hand of punter pimp and pornographer and place it into the hand of woman and girl be grateful to my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi for secure this debate which as she point out be my first as home office minister although definitely not my first on this subject by any stretch of the imagination from the outset let say that it be privilege to have be ask by the prime minister to serve and to work on some of the issue to which have devote much of my life both inside and outside this building we have an enormous task on our hand debate such as this underline why it be so critical that we make real progress in protect woman and in this instance man as well and all people from harm we know that sexual exploitation disproportionately affect woman and girl as say it affect man as well although those who be buy sex tend always to come from the same group it be time that we treat tackle violence against woman and girl as the national emergency that it be new government policy will be announce in due course but want to restate that believe passionately that change in this area be need and until it be achieve we must not rest on hearing account such as those we have hear tonight from my hon friend be not sure how we could come to any other conclusion will continue to work closely with charity and non governmental organisation have meet almost all those mention by my hon friend to support service in advance their effort to protect survivor and hold perpetrator to account turn to the specific point of the debate this government will use every lever available to stop commercial sexual exploitation and all kind of sexual exploitation we be committed to tackle the harm that it bring the most vulnerable in our society deserve nothing less when look at commercial sexual exploitation it be undeniable that we have to consider carefully those who be exploit under
