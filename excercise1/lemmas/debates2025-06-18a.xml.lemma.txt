gay district and one explode in brixton in an attack on south london black community the sick terrorist who commit those evil act be motivate by hatred he hat bengalis and black people because of their race he hat lgbt people because of who they love and how they live their life he hat those group because they be different from he he hat they because of who they be raise that appalling incident to remind the house that hatred come in many form but whoever in our society it be against we must all stand equally strongly against it we must have hate crime law that show that whether the hatred be for someone race religion sexual orientation gender identity or disability britain be country that will not tolerate it that all hatred be equal and that all those who commit vile act of hatred will face the same grave consequence regret to say that that be not currently the case today the law recognise five category of hate crime race religion sexual orientation transgender identity and disability but only two race and religion be treat as aggravate offence subject to strong sentencing power the other three be not that discrepancy can not be right we can not say as society that some form of hatred be more evil than other be at university when section be introduce remember it vividly it be more than law it be an attack on the right of people like to live openly it stigmatise lesbian gay and bisexual people and it push we out of public life go into politic to fight that cruel law and everything it represent hate corrode our entire society it do not just harm the individual who be target it create fear fear to go outside fear to speak up fear to be see it silence people it make we all afraid research by stonewall find that less than half of people feel safe hold their partner hand in public that be the impact that the fear of hatred have on people it make they afraid even to show the world that they exist unfortunately far too many recorded crime never result in charge of disability hate crime record by police lead to prosecution of homophobic hate crime lead to prosecution of hate crime against transgender people only lead to prosecution behind those statistic be real people whose scar may heal on the outside but who may never recover from the fear and trauma that they have suffer in teenage far right extremist be jail for target and attack transgender woman along with another young man he kick she to the ground in park in swansea and hurl transphobic abuse at she in cassie phd student and wheelchair user be wait outside shop when two drunk man grab her wheelchair push she down the road and make sexual comment she have to escape by roll into traffic we must fight back against this hatred we must show that we be not content to stick with the status quo the victim of these attack deserve to live in society that say that we take this hatred seriously and will not stand for it victim must be at the heart of our criminal justice system and we must ensure that law protect they that be why my new clause be so important lgbt and disabled people tell that they do not feel as safe as they use to we be see rise transphobia everywhere pride flag be be take down at county hall and some politician be openly question whether disability be even real be proud that labour in our manifesto commit to equalise our hate crime law by make hate crime against lgbt people and disabled people aggravate offence be proud to be bring forward that change through new clause hope that can persuade all my parliamentary colleague to support the new clause today and to take this important step forward for equal right thank my hon friend the members for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier and for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball for stand shoulder to shoulder with throughout this process and urge the house to support the new clause as mps we receive wide range of correspondence from constituent during some of the most difficult time in their life but the email that receive from emma johnson be perhaps one of the most harrowing that have ever receive it be because of emma story that have table new clause and will speak to it today on november emma have just go into labour with her young child mother and child be okay when she receive call inform she that her parent have be tragically kill in car crash the driver of the other vehicle have no licence and be uninsured on what be suppose to be one of the happy day of emma life she instead have to identify the body of her parent ian and gail when the case come to court the driver of the other vehicle be charge with the less offence of cause death by careless driving rather than by dangerous driving that produce the sentence available to the court even though he be swerve in and out of traffic and drive without licence or insurance put it to the house that this by its very nature be dangerous since the verdict emma have be fight not for vengeance but to make sure that no other family have to suffer the same injustice she have seek justice not just for her parent but for other people who face the same heartbreak she be call for simple but vital change any driver who kill while drive without licence or insurance should automatically face the more serious offence of cause death by dangerous driving today say directly to emma who know be watch that fundamentally agree with you your dedication to the cause be commendable and you be do your late parent proud we know that road accident happen but if someone wilfully get behind the wheel of car when unlicensed and uninsured and swerve in and out of traffic that be not an accident it be dangerous choice to put other live at risk new clause would rightly treat such behaviour as seriously as drive under the influence of drug or alcohol it would close loophole in the current law and bring great justice for victim if the new clause do not progress today ask the minister to meet and emma to ensure that her campaign continue shockat adam gideon amos lee anderson stuart anderson steffan aquarone edward argar victoria atkins gareth bacon harriett baldwin steve barclay peter bedford apsana
