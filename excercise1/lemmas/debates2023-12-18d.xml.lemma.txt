forecast what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the employment rate forecast in the office for budget responsibility economic and fiscal outlook publish in

november the government be commit to increase employment payroll employment be at near record high of million which be up million on the pre pandemic level the office for budget responsibility forecast that our back to work plan will see more people in work over the forecast period the obr reveal at the time of the autumn statement that after more than year of this conservative government more people will be on health and disability benefit by far from it be back to work budget the secretary of state know that that be not anything like the truth and that the tories be fail the employment market in this country can not agree with that in fact point the hon gentleman to the figure of which be the number of people few the obr forecast will be on those very long term sickness and disability benefit because of the reform that this government be bring in last week the office for national statistics publish figure show that of people of work age in bradford be claim out of work benefit which be the high rate in the leeds city region do the secretary of state believe that the government back to work plan be work for people in my constituency of bradford south the back to work plan have billion of pound worth of investment behind it include the billion announce by the chancellor in the spring budget such thing as extend restart bring forward mandatory placement after month to ensure that people get into work and double universal support be important measure that will see increase number in work call the shadow minister all we hear from the secretary of state on employment be smoke and mirror but thankfully the obr have publish the number we have just hear what he believe be happen with employment because of his policy but when the obr look at his policy do its forecast show the employment rate compare with today to be go up or down in have already share the figure with the house which be that payroll employment be at near historic high and unemployment be at near historic low as the hon lady will know we have never have labour government leave office with unemployment lower at the end of their term than when they start youth unemployment go up under the labour party whereas under this conservative government it have reduce by you can always tell the conservatives be struggle to answer the question mr speaker because they go back to those same old thing about what happen under the last labour government after year they have nothing to be proud of if what the secretary of state say be true we might expect that after little time some of his policy would work but be it not true that it be not just next year that the obr forecast the employment rate to be down but the year after that too we will continue to bear down on the level of unemployment as the hon lady know economic inactivity have reduce and we have few people in economic inactivity than at the peak during the pandemic we have plan be it not the reality that the opposition have no plan and no idea as to how to get those number down we do and it be work welfare fraud and error what step his department be take to reduce level of fraud and error in the welfare system in fraud and error fall by we be invest million in addition to that which we have already put forward to prevent billion of fraud and error by thank the secretary of state for his answer and welcome the measure the government be take on the new power to search through bank account to look for fraudulent transaction can he confirm that the government will seek to use they only where fraud be suspect and will not as some people have suggest search every state pensioner bank account to look for something that almost certainly will not be there thank my hon friend for what be very important question because there have be great deal of scaremongere about what exactly these power be about can make it categorically clear from the dispatch box that these power be there to make sure that in instance where there be clear signal of fraud or error my department be able to take action in the absence of that it will not the cost of living payment be vital mean of support during the cost of living crisis but my constituent have lose out through no fault of her own because of the well know issue whereby two of her work payday fall within the assessment period use to assess eligibility will the government review the eligibility process for the third cost of live payment to ensure that no one else miss out this be long stand issue that crop up every few year it be not something on which the government intend to take specific action we trust people to manage their finance such that they can cope with the occasional eventuality where there be an additional year within any one calendar year insecure employment and poverty what assessment he have make of the potential impact of insecure employment on people in poverty this government have make it clear that we believe that work be the good route out of poverty it be important for different type of work to exist as each individual worker circumstance be personal to they and dwp have an in work progression offer to support low pay claimant to progress into well pay and more secure employment do the minister agree that the difference between insecure or exploitative work and go plural with portfolio of well pay freelance or part time role depend on how valuable someone skill be minister be rightly offer fresh opportunity for jobseeker to improve their skill but in post pandemic world that be very different from what go before what plan do she have to revisit and update the recommendation of the taylor review to protect people whose skill have not yet be upgrade thank my hon friend for make that point as someone who be self employ for not far off year understand where he be come from our work coach at jobcentre plus office engage with claimant to support access to skill provision they get comprehensive range of support which include apprenticeship skill bootcamp vocational and basic training skill and career advice so that they can work in way that suit they less than of worker on zero hour contract want more hour it be more about caring or other flexibility but be happy to look at the point he have raise in the chamber report december vol call the chair of the select committee last week uber come to parliament to brief mp on partnership it have set up to support its driver include its recognition agreement with the gmb trade union all uber private hire driver be now auto enrol into pension but legal uncertainty mean that that be not the case for uber competitor be it not high time for the government to bring forward their employment bill which be promise after the taylor review to provide level playing field for employer and to tackle these problem of insecurity in the gig economy thank the chair of the select committee for his question in fact have an uber shirt from my time as employment minister which the company give when it bring in the pension applaud the work that uber have do to support its workforce the right hon gentleman make an important point which be actually for another department but will take those message away child poverty what step his department be take to help reduce the number of child in poverty what step his department be

have significant number of pensioner who have lose their partner now face the add challenge of manage increase living cost alone can the minister kindly elaborate on what specific initiative or support mechanism be in place to assist people in those financially difficult circumstance to ensure that they get the support they deserve anyone who suffer bereavement at any time will potentially be in severe financial difficulty direct my hon friend to the funeral expense payment which be part of the social fund would also point to the wide measure that we have take such as apply the triple lock there will be an increase in the state pension next year we will also include cost of live payment in the winter fuel payment of or depend on the age of the recipient despite the welcome fall in inflation my constituent deborah garrard speak for herself and many pensioner who be concerned about second winter of high fuel price will my hon friend outline what further measure the department be consider to help reduce pensioner financial burden know that mrs garrard will not be the only old resident in the country concern about energy price this winter just mention the increase cost of live

wealth the overall number of child in absolute poverty after housing cost remain stable between and the late statistic show that in there be few child in absolute poverty after housing cost than in the government continue to provide comprehensive support to help people find progress in and thrive in work recognise that that have to be sustainable in tackle poverty couple of week ago when ask the prime minister why of child in stockton north live in poverty he claim that child poverty be down but even if we rely on his and his government unique measuring tool child poverty be still up considerably across every part of the north east under his watch accord to the joseph rowntree foundation million british child have suffer destitution in the past year when will the prime minister and his ministers stop pretend that they care and make way for labour government who will sort out the mess that sham the tories the government be determined to ensure that all child wherever they come from have the good start in life we be commit to support family and help they into work the full uprating this year and last be the signal destitution what step his department be take to help reduce the number of people experience destitution the government be of course fully commit to protect the most vulnerable which be why we roll out billion in cost of live payment across the period from to it be why as the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend the member for mid sussex mims davies have repeatedly stress we increase the rate for the lha housing support and why benefit increase by the full it be absolutely heartbreaking that in the world sixth rich country we now have million people live in destitution we know that disabled people be more likely to live in poverty yet this winter disabled people will not be get any additional help with the cost of live after the separate disability cost of live payment be quietly drop the cost of live for disabled people be still go up so will the secretary of state commit to reinstate the payment and at level that meet the extra living cost face by disabled people be not sure precisely which disability payment the hon gentleman be refer to but certainly the cost of live disability payment have be pay this year in addition to the increase in the national living wage tax cut and national insurance tax cut all of which help people particularly those on low pay that be why under this government the level of absolutely poverty have fall by million since with few child in poverty flexible working whether he have make an assessment of the role of flexible work arrangement in support people to take up employment flexible working can play an important role in support people to start stay in and succeed in work and for business to grow have already see at first hand example of good employer offer tailor role or change hour to support worker particularly parent who have caring responsibility flexibility have make difference and drive success for all as the minister mention the hospital industry especially in coastal constituency such as mine be suffer disproportionately from high vacancy level exacerbate by covid and the shift in work pattern what more can the government do to encourage smart working and job sharing for example student and young people could work some of the later and weekend hour the less social hour share with parent with family responsibility who could work more regular hour during the daytime the uk hospitality industry do fantastic job particularly at this time of the year when it be help we to enjoy the festive season be provide help and collaboration by deliver pilot scheme across the industry in particular we be develop more standardised approach to training which include proposal to award hospitality skill passport we need to do all we can with worker to build confidence and the right skill be interested by my hon friend idea of help employer to refocus where the need be and shall be happy to work with he because hospitality offer great career and transferable skill define benefit pension schemes whether he have have recent discussion with the pensions regulator on the adequacy of the administration of define benefit pension scheme be fortunate in have already be able to meet representative of the pensions regulator twice since my appointment to discuss the full gamut of their responsibility member of the bp pension scheme define benefit scheme have see the value of their pension fall by in real term as consequence of their senior management refusal to upgrade they in line with the cost of living although the pension fund itself have billion surplus do the minister agree that if the rule allow company such as bp to deal from the bottom of the deck when it come to their own pensioner these be rule that need to be change that be certainly something need to look into when people raise the issue of specific pension scheme be always conscious of just how many thousand of scheme member be potentially watch so do not wish to speak off the cuff and raise hope that may not be able to fulfil however shall be happy to meet the right hon gentleman to discuss the circumstance in great detail and see what can be do call rob roberts he be otherwise engaged call virginia crosbie long term sickness and disability what step his department be take to encourage people who be economically inactive owe to long term sickness and disability to return to work the government have range of initiative to help disabled people and people with health condition to start stay in and succeed in work we build on that in the autumn statement by expand universal support launch workwell pilot reform the fit note and establish an expert group on occupational health do the minister agree that the disability confident job fair that be host in holyhead with my brilliant anglesey dwp team be an opportunity for excellent local business such as hafan môr and llechwedd meats and organisation such as môn communities forward and the menter môn enterprise hub to help people with disability back into work and will she lobby the secretary of state to visit ynys môn in february to open the disability job fair do not want to commit the secretary of state but have feeling that he will be in ynys môn in february thank my hon friend for the huge amount of work that she do in respect of local jobcentre and for her work with those employer meet she just last week to discuss her focus on young people her local jobs for local people campaign be great example of her tireless work for the future of the community in ynys môn so iechyd da topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility may begin by welcome my new team to the front bench join the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend the member for mid sussex mims davies and lord younger in the other place be the new minister for employment my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds jo churchill and the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend the member for blackpool north and cleveleys paul maynard know that they will make great contribution to the department let also thank those who have depart my right hon friend the member for sevenoaks laura trott and my hon friend the members for corby tom pursglove and for hexham guy opperman who have important other duty in government this have be year of considerable achievement for my department we have already hear about the cost of living payment the support for the most vulnerable the increase in working age benefit the increase in respect of the triple lock for pensioner welfare reform near record level of payroll employment and almost historically low level of unemployment and rise real wage welcome the government decision to boost childcare payment for parent on universal credit by almost which the work and pensions committee push for have ask the department to review childcare rule for parent in training and education but can my right hon friend outline the other way in which the government be support low income family in stroud my hon friend be be too modest in lay all the progress at the door of the select committee because it be she in particular who push for those reform to childcare within universal credit and believe that she be quite rightly name check by the chancellor in his budget statement we of course have the back to work plan the extension of restart the doubling of universal support the great ever increase in the national living wage and the reduction in employee national insurance all of which be there to drive further employment call the scottish national party spokesperson during the recent covid inquiry the former health secretary the right hon member for west suffolk matt hancock say that statutory sick pay be far too low and that if he have magic wand he would fix it give that the secretary of state have the magic wand as the minister responsible for this when be he go to fix it be certainly not go to start make policy up on the hoof at the dispatch box this afternoon or promise more money for statutory sickness pay that would require discussion across government but note the point that the hon gentleman have make welcome this government back to work plan and the emphasis on work be the most effective way out of poverty what support can be make available for people in high unemployment area to travel or relocate to area of low unemployment such as banff and buchan which have high number of vacancy particularly in the seafood processing sector thank my hon friend and note his relentless support for the seafood industry more broadly and the processing industry in particular understand that the former minister for employment my hon friend the member for hexham guy opperman visit scotland early this year to look at that industry work coach offer tailor employment support to all jobseeker and the flexible support fund be available at the discretion of jobcentre to purchase good and service include travel to support claimant to move from one area to another in order to take up job opportunity know that my hon friend be work hard in his local area to find solution and be always happy to discuss idea with he many people take the decision to pay for pension top up in and but in numerous instance this have not lead to any increase in their state pension nor have they receive any explanation or refund have the department make an assessment of the average delay in people receive their pension top up the advice to anyone seek to top up their pension or buy extra national insurance credit would be to ring the future pension centre in advance of make any payment to determine whether they would actually enhance their pension by make they it be always good for people to check before they make those payment to make sure that they will improve their pension minister be rightly put great deal of money and focus behind back to work programme across the country what progress have they make towards transparently publish the outcome so that we can see which programme perform well or bad in different part of the country and why the dwp regularly publish statistic on its employment programme and the late statistical release of the restart programme be publish on december the back to work plan announce further measure to tackle long term unemployment such as mandatory placement for those who complete restart without secure job the policy detail include the reporting be yet to be work through it be vital that local authority such as gateshead and voluntary community organisation know as soon as possible whether the household support fund will be extend beyond march can the secretary of state confirm when they will finally get definitive answer on this as the hon lady will know these be matter for the treasury and specifically for the chancellor of the exchequer he and have conversation on these matter and other announcement will be make in due course but of course the household support fund will be in place until the end of march at this time of year the department give benefit recipient generous christmas gift of which have not be increase for think year will the secretary of state look to make it at least next year to help people bit more with the extra cost at christmas as pension minister my main focus be on make sure that we have high quality sustainable pension system that year on year keep the value of the overall state pension as high as possible and that meet our manifesto commitment to the triple lock that be the good way of focus on the value of the state pension twenty month ago the equality and human rights commission issue section agreement request to the department follow concern regard breach and potential discrimination against disabled people why have the department still not reach an agreement as the hon lady will know there be ongoing discussion on these matter by virtue of the legislation that underpin those interaction the discussion be necessarily hold in private be inform that they have result in positive engagement and that the department and the ehrc will come forward with response as soon as possible the world big lidl warehouse in houghton regis be not only half kilometre long and can deliver pallet day it be also create job what specific help can jobcentre plus give to employer such as lidl which have huge number of vacancy to fill in my constituency it be fantastic to hear of the job opportunity create by lidl in south west bedfordshire know my hon friend will be work hard with lidl and his local jobcentre to make sure the vacancy be fill with local talent jobcentres can work closely with large employer as have recently see at morrison which have specific neurodiversity pilot to bring people into the job market the barrier that restrict neurodiverse people be often challenge around confidence and so on jobcentre be brilliant force for good and recommend that everybody engage with they on bespoke scheme for neurodiversity or any other focus on tackle long term unemployment order hate to say it but have lot of people to get in in there be to year old on long term sickness and health benefit that figure now stand at massive why be that and what be the government do about those appalling figure the hon gentleman be right there have be marked increase in the prevalence of mental health condition particularly among those age to which be why we be bring in measure such as universal support and talk therapy within the national health service for which additional place be announce by the chancellor at the autumn

commonwealth and development affairs what step he be take to support jimmy lai during his trial and if he will call for his immediate and unconditional release the foreign secretary have call on the hong kong authority to end their prosecution of jimmy lai and release he he also urge the chinese authority to repeal the national security law and end the prosecution of all individual charge under it the foreign secretary and welcome the opportunity to meet mr lai son sebastien again last week and to listen to his concern as the trial approach as the foreign secretary have make clear mr lai prosecution be politically motivated he have face multiple charge to discredit and silence he as an outspoken journalist and publisher he have be target in clear attempt to stop the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression and association the foreign secretary raise mr lai prosecution with foreign minister wang yi on december as his predecessor do in beijing on august we will continue to press for mr lai release with the hong kong and chinese authority diplomat from our consulate general attend court today as visible sign of the uk support and they will continue to do so we will continue to press for consular access to mr lai which the hong kong prison authority have repeatedly refuse china consider anyone of chinese heritage bear in china to be chinese national it do not recognise other nationality and therefore consider mr lai to be exclusively chinese more broadly we have make it clear that the national security law have damage hong kong and its way of life right and freedom have be significantly erode and arrest under the law have silence opposition voice it be clear breach of the sino british joint declaration the legally bind un register treaty that china willingly enter into its continued existence and use be demonstration of china break its international commitment we will continue to stand up for the people of hong kong to call out violation of their right and freedom and to hold china to its international obligation thank my right hon friend for her response jimmy lai be and have always be full british citizen and he have never hold chinese passport and therefore he should have be publicly recognise by the government some time ago however welcome the change in rhetoric by the foreign secretary who say today that jimmy lai be british citizen and call on the chinese government to release he be pleased that there seem to have be shift in policy notwithstanding that and hon friend have raise the issue of his citizenship with the foreign office to no avail until now at the heart of the issue lie the sino british agreement recall that at the time of its signing the ambassador in beijing percy cradock say of china leader that they may be thuggish dictator but that they be man of their word and could be trust to do what they promise how history always show we wrong we can not trust thuggish dictator and they have trash the sino british agreement without so much as by your leave instead we now have political persecution destruction of press freedom force confession and the targeting of foreign national as matter of course the national security law be the key because it have be strip away their right and particularly those of jimmy lai who face lifetime in prison new axis of totalitarian state have form include china north korea russia iran and syria we must be on our toe and realise that their target be democracy itself give that will the government reconsider their word in the integrated review and reinstate the idea that china be systemic threat not just to we but to the very value that we seek must tell the government that an individual already know to and some other be be use in the persecution of jimmy lai we know that he have be torture to give evidence so clearly his evidence can not be rely on in the light of that will the government give commitment today that if and when uk or other citizen be target through the evidence at jimmy lai trial concrete action will be take to protect they and that we will do so by work with our ally include the us japan and other in europe this be very serious issue and it may yet erupt will the government now sanction john lee and other responsible for hong kong national security law after all the us have sanction people and we have sanction none be the uk government consider how to allow hong kong asylum application to switch to british national overseas application to save all the heartache as we approach christmas mr speaker this brave and devoted christian will order be sorry but the right hon gentleman be way way over time be sure that other hon member will bring in the other point think we all agree with my right hon friend that the breach of the sino british joint declaration be great tragedy as the foreign secretary set out the national security law which we be call on the hong kong authority to repeal be breach so many of those value that we understand that china be willing to maintain with hong kong after my right hon friend mention the integrated review refresh in which the prime minister set out very clearly our perspective which be that we consider china to be an epoch define challenge it then set out in great detail number of area of concern around china and economic coercive activity we continue to work closely with the and other partner around the world to tackle that and to work together to try to persuade china to reverse some of those policy importantly say this lot at the dispatch box as the sanction minister listen very closely as do all of we here and our official in the foreign office on all issue relate to potential future sanction we continue to look at those under the global human right sanction regulation in this arena but we do not speculate about future sanction designation because of course that could reduce their impact call the shadow minister the ongoing detention of jimmy lai british citizen be stark symbol of the decline of hong kong freedom and china flagrant disregard for the legally binding sino british agreement which promise high degree of autonomy for hongkongers for year jimmy lai trial be further chapter in the erosion of the liberty promise then to the people of hong kong my right hon friend the shadow foreign secretary and have meet jimmy son sebastien regularly and make unequivocally clear labour position that jimmy must be release immediately and that the national security law under which he be be charge be abhorrent welcome the intervention by the new foreign secretary as mr lai trial begin today but there must be sustain interest by the government in way that have be sorely lack until now we can not sit idly by while british citizen experience politically motivate trial and the authority attempt to stifle freedom of expression urge the minister to give firm commitment right here that the foreign secretary intervention will not be one off and that the government will follow labour lead in sustained consistent and full throate support for mr lai and his legal counsel and in put the freedom promise to the people of hong kong at the top of her agenda as the minister both for the indo pacific region china and hong kong be in my purview and for sanction the issue of jimmy lai and other hold in this way be very much at the top of my agenda they always have be and always will remain so have meet sebastien lai on number of occasion this year and have work closely with he and his team to understand the situation and to look at the support that we can provide the frustration be that we be not able to provide consular access because we be not allow to visit he in prison the foreign secretary set out yesterday that he have call for jimmy lai release and we will continue to sustain that throughout the trial at the moment we expect the trial to last some day so we expect to see it wrap up in the summer we will be work very closely with like minded partner us canadian australian new zealand european and swiss representative be also in court today to make it clear that we all have one view which be that this be trial from which jimmy lai need to be release be interested in the question of mr lai nationality status if he be full british citizen will my right hon friend confirm whether hong kong have unilaterally withdraw consular right for foreign mission to visit their citizen in prison or be that specifically the case for those imprison under the national security law whichever it be could she confirm that the foreign office have do everything possible to ensure that the hong kong government realise that those right of access for our citizen should not be violate lightly my hon friend be right that consular access should in an ideal world be provide to all those who find themselves in prison whatever the country the frustrating fact be that it be up to country not specifically china whether it consider dual nationality acceptable obviously we will consider such dual national british they will have british passport we have absolutely do everything and we continue to ask for consular access for jimmy lai be able to help he get new passport early in the year because his old one have run out we work with the home office to ensure that we be very comfortable and certain that he be indeed british citizen but as set out the hong kong authority consider hong kong national bear in mainland china to be chinese citizen hence their view on dual nationality and the impossibility of our authority visit he in prison at the moment call the snp spokesperson thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure this urgent question and lord alton baroness kennedy and the hon member for strangford jim shannon for their continue and unwavering support for jimmy lai who as uk national be entitle to expect much more support from the government than he have thus far receive year old pro democracy campaigner in ail health have be imprison for more than day on trump up charge yet it be only yesterday that his government finally call for he to be release hope that have misunderstood the minister but be we to believe that the uk influence be so diminish that we can not get access to mr lai in prison will she detail what practical support be be give to he now that his show trial have start and will she give cast iron guarantee that in the event that beijing get the verdict that it be look for the government will proactively come to this house to make statement on what action they intend to take rather than have it drag out of they through another urgent question will not reiterate my previous answer on the subject of consular access and the challenge that we face in be able to support jimmy lai in that way reiterate the hon member point that many colleague across the house have be ardent champion and supporter of jimmy lai and indeed of his family as they seek to ensure that his case be understand across the world we will continue to call for jimmy lai release the national security law need to be repeal those be message that we will continue to highlight with the authority at every possible opportunity can thank you personally mr speaker for grant today urgent question the pantomime trial of jimmy lai be just the tip of huge iceberg of the chinese communist party industrial scale abuse of human right and indifference to the international rule of law today parliaments around the world be express their solidarity with jimmy lai and the oppressed freedom love people of hong kong but there must be consequence it be no good just monitor human right sanction across the globe my right hon friend have have year to name some of the legal and other official of the chinese government who be undermine and abuse human right as we speak when will we see action and what be she do to address the concern about the continual erosion of the judicial process in hong kong and the involvement there of british judge we need action not constant warm word we continue to use sanction tool across the piece at every opportunity where the evidence come to we and we can use it bear in mind that as we always say be sorry that it be frustrating for colleague we will never discuss potential future sanction designation because it could reduce their impact we will always listen to and look closely at the evidence bring to we and indeed at the work that our team across the world do to try to bring to bear our sanction regime against the human right violation that we be see sadly as we predict the people of hong kong have see their freedom systematically erode since the national security law be introduce in pro democracy activist such as jimmy lai have be detain public library have be empty of book see as promote so call bad ideology and the recent patriot only local election see opposition candidate ban from stand can the minister please explain how the uk government plan to uphold their commitment to human right and freedom for all hongkongers the hon lady be right it have be tragic to see the disintegration of all those freedom which when both country sign up to the sino british joint declaration we consider that china would stand by of course when we see the national security law come in we respond very quickly and decisively in particular with the new immigration path for british national overseas passport holder so that we could provide that security for those who feel under most stress we also suspend the extradition treaty with hong kong indefinitely to provide protection for those people and we have extend our arm embargo on mainland china to cover hong kong this be tragic situation and we will continue to call for change and for the hong kong authority to reverse the national security law and restore those freedom that be part of hong kong extraordinary opportunity for economic success as well as other thing give everything that be happen in china include this pitiful show trial be it not now time that the government of this country develop proper coherent cross government strategy for deal with china since they be patently lack one at the moment as we set out in the integrated review refresh publish in march china challenge to both economic and global security be one that we consider to be right at the heart of the challenge we face we continue to work closely with official and in concert with and other partner around the world to tackle some of those challenge the minister will be aware hope that timothy owen kc who be part of jimmy lai defence team be currently in hong kong but because of the failure to give he visa to deal with jimmy lai case be not able to appear for jimmy lai will she make representation to the local authority as matter of urgency say that surely the right to appoint counsel of one own choosing be fundamental in any fair legal system and that we would expect that opportunity to be give to mr lai the interpretation by china standing committee of the national people congress of the national security law at the end of last year state that the chief executive would have to certify whether an act or issue involve national security include the question of overseas lawyer participation otherwise its statement be that the chief executive lead national security committee should make the decision so attempt to challenge that have sadly fail and the high court have note that hong kong court have no jurisdiction over it but we have call on the chief executive to respect those right and freedom in hong kong and to uphold the rule of law as we all understand it how many time must totalitarian communist state behave like totalitarian communist state before the government will recognise it as totalitarian communist state do not quite know how to follow such an articulately put question my right hon friend highlight one of the many challenge for those of we who believe in uphold and want to allow other country around the world to uphold those value and freedom freedom of speech freedom of choice and freedom of association and we will continue to work with ally and partner to highlight and to sanction where we can and where we have the tool to do so those who continue to breach those freedom pay tribute to jimmy lai uk base legal team however they have be subject to incredible level of cyber harassment and other form of harassment and interference while work on his legal case what be the minister do with other departments to ensure that lawyer and journalist involve in promote and advocate for freedom and democracy around the world be protect from such unacceptable level of transnational repression the hon lady be absolutely right there have be shocking attempt to dissuade make fearful and stop jimmy lai legal team here in the uk get on with their job of defend his case and raise the issue that we have set out today we work closely with the home office as do his lawyer to support it and other part of government to provide those team with the technical support that they need we will continue to do that it be perhaps question to pick up and discuss in more detail with the minister for security my right hon friend the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat can ask he whether he will discuss it with the hon lady should she so wish ten day ago on december jimmy have his birthday it be not rude to say that he be not young man this house could send message to the rest of the world through an early day motion an early day motion be table on december by the hon member for strangford jim shannon and more member need to sign it will not give the honour to people outside this chamber who decry early day motion although in fact there be not that many of they if we want to send message there be methodology although it be not the only one know that lot of colleague do not like sign early day motion but on this occasion perhaps they should my right hon friend be absolutely right the tool that we have at our disposal here in the mother of parliaments which allow for freedom of speech and expression be incredibly important as minister who spend lot of her time on the other side of the world in country large and small be very conscious that the messaging from this parliament be hear loud and clear in every other country we perhaps forget just how important our voice be in stand up for the value that we believe in mr lai detention be shocking symbol of the erosion not just of human right but of freedom of expression in hong kong give everything that we be see unfold what step be the minister take to ensure that we be supportive of what remain of free press in hong kong jimmy lai have be an extraordinary champion of free speech which he choose to continue despite the change landscape in hong kong we continue to support people across the piece many of whom have come to the uk for sanctuary to be able to be able to speak out and use our freedom of press to share their concern and highlight the abuse they be see join the call for jimmy lai release he be devout catholic and his faith motivate his courageous campaigning for democracy in hong kong after the sustain dismantle in hong kong of freedom of expression of association of the press of judicial independence and other do the minister share my concern that the threat to freedom of religion or belief in hong kong be now very real if she do not will she please read sell out my soul the impending threats to freedom of religion or belief in hong kong the new report by hong kong watch my hon friend continue in her role to be an extraordinary champion for freedom of religion or belief and absolutely agree with she we continue of course to monitor freedom of religion or belief in hong kong through our regular six monthly report to parliament and through interaction with local faith leader the late report publish on september note that religious practice be generally not restrict with variety of religious practice coexist across the territory she be absolutely right the strength that jimmy lai seek and find through his faith be extraordinary and it will help he in this very difficult time congratulate the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on secure the urgent question jimmy lai have many supporter in the uk include brit and those from hong kong but many of they have experience intimidation and harassment here in the uk from the chinese communist party those from hong kong face certain persecution arrest and detention if they be force to return twelve activist have recently be tell by the uk government that they be not at risk and have have their asylum claim reject can the minister explain uk government policy on whether hong kong campaigner should qualify for asylum in the uk as set out early we bring forward the british national overseas route for hong kong resident to come to the uk so far approximately application have be process and have be grant the point the hon gentleman mention be one that be aware the home office be look into there have be change in relation to age in the processing and there be an issue there that know it be look at now will ask the home office to update he once it have finish its review regime such as this have to be judge not on its word but on its deed in its systematic demolition of the rule of law and now of the independence of the legal profession itself which be such lively part of an economically successful and prosperous hong kong china be demonstrate its real intention what more can the government do not only to take direct action by way of sanction against the individual concern but to make the strong point that the basic law be not an historical document but live instrument and that we expect it to be adhere to my right hon and learn friend highlight an issue with which he be very familiar he practise the law and indeed he be absolutely right the judiciary the legal profession and those who be servant of it assure the safety and the right outcome of case and we will continue to challenge the hong kong authority on the failure of the national security law and call for it to be repeal the rule of law and how it be uphold across the world be absolutely essential to our global security and peace and mr lai case show how fragile they be so what more can the government do to reassert the importance of our all abide by the rule of law the hon lady be absolutely right and much of the work that our diplomatic team across the world do be in country where the rule of law be not necessarily adhere to but where there be abuse human right violation and so on we continue to highlight and challenge those work alongside international partner to persuade those leadership to change their way and to understand both the merit of well deliver legal system and the value that add to the credibility of the political leadership of their nation it be something we do week in week out sadly there be many country across the world where these challenge continue but it be right at the heart of the diplomatic service work the use of international lawyer have be long stand practice in hong kong and we have fail mr lai will the minister advise exactly what step will be take and when to secure or attempt to secure international legal representation of the british citizen mr lai as set out in answer to an early question jimmy lai obviously want to have his own choice of legal representation he have fantastic team of lawyer here in the uk support he the challenge for those represent he at the trial be one that we continue to highlight as set out early the frustration in the way this system work mean that he do not have the international lawyer of his choose with he however we will continue to highlight those failing and as so many colleague have highlight what we consider the right use of the legal system and such independent representation should be every reasonable democrat will be happy to support the plea of the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on behalf of mr lai however there be whiff of hypocrisy in the air in former ambassador craig murray be imprison on the fabricated conceit of jigsaw identification and julian assange have be hold in belmarsh prison for or more day will the government lead by example and desist from harass journalist craig murray and other and free julian assange now rise order be not quite sure that that meet what we be expect so call jim shannon while be thankful that the foreign secretary publicly acknowledge the case of jimmy lai at the united nations in february and reportedly raise the case with chinese official during his visit to beijing the fact be that british citizen remain behind bar may gently remind right hon and hon member of early day motion to which they might want to add their name and ask that the foreign secretary with the voice of the entire british government include our prime minister and this house call for the immediate and unconditional release of jimmy lai who have spend day behind bar will the minister do that today and follow it through tomorrow with the appropriate channel the hon gentleman be the most incredible champion for so many whose life and whose family life continue to be blight by challenge to freedom of religion or belief he be always willing to stand up for they as minister do not think be allow to sign edm but should you wish to change that rule mr speaker would be extremely happy to sign this one

washington and canberra just like aukus most importantly develop sixth generation fighter will ensure that we can continue to safeguard our uk sky and those of our nato ally for decade to come it will inspire innovation strengthen uk industry and keep britain at the cutting edge of defence technology the defence secretary be right to report that to the house defence industrial collaboration underpin by treaty be unusual it be multi decade undertaking for this nation as the secretary of state say it should command support across the house and ministers should report on it openly and regularly may ask he what scope the treaty allow to work with other ally both at secondary level and as primary partner do article ensure that the export problem with the typhoon will not be encounter with gcap when will he lay the treaty before parliament for ratification this month the national audit office report on the mod equipment plan it expose billion black hole in britain defence plan and show that ministers have lose control of the defence budget in june the defence command paper reaffirm that the uk would spend billion on this project out to will the secretary of state confirm what funding have be make available for gcap in the defence budget for and in response to write question the then procurement minister the right hon and learn member for cheltenham alex chalk tell back in march we will determine the cost share arrangement ahead of the next phase have that now be do ahead of the treaty signing meanwhile the infrastructure and projects authority this year downgrade the gcap programme to red which rat successful delivery to be unachievable there be major issue which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable what be the major issue that lead to the ipa downgrade what action be the secretary of state now take to lift the red rating the secretary of state say this afternoon that the joint development phase will launch in his press statement on the treaty signing say this combat aircraft be due to take to the sky in keep the programme on time as well as in budget will be critical so by what date do he expect the design to be lock down the national work share to be settle the manufacture agreement to be in place and the first flight trial to begin sign the treaty be the easy part britain and its ally must now do the hard work to get this new generation fighter aircraft in the air and on time may start by warmly welcome the right hon gentleman welcoming of this treaty signing and the overall programme as say member on both side of the house agree that the defence of the realm come first in an ever more dangerous world it be important to have the facility that sixth generation fighter aircraft would bring the right hon gentleman mention that the hq be come to london but want to put it on record that it be come to the uk we have not decide location for it yet think there be plus potential location so would not want to assume that it will be base in london we be not as london centric on everything as he may be the right hon gentleman ask about example of work internationally previously it be worth point out that the typhoon be italian british german and spanish and it have be very successful programme we be use to work with partner include italy which be involve in this programme the right hon gentleman ask about article export issue think his question be bear out of specific concern about german export licence which we believe be resolvable time will tell on wide basis we recognise that such an aircraft can only be truly successful if the market be great than the uk italy and japan the right hon gentleman ask about the broad equipment plan and he mention the billion programme there be number of caveat of course we have see huge inflation but at the other end we have also see big expansion of the amount of money that be go into our year equipment programme that number which be snapshot in time be take before the refresh and take into account programme that will and will not happen so it be not quite as black and white as he present the right hon gentleman ask about cost sharing on the programme that be part of what the process of discussion both on the treaty and on the new gigo organisation will ascertain that be because the industrial capacity and capability of each of the three country be important as be the intellectual property that will be bring forward that be part of what that organisation be currently establish it can not be prejudge simply because we be likely to have great industrial capacity in certain area relative to other country the amount of project ownership will therefore fall on these factor how much money go in the intellectual property and the industrial capacity the right hon gentleman ask about rag red amber green rating if remember rightly will correct the record if be wrong one of the reason for the red rating be about lay treaty for the project that be one of the reason why we be lay the treaty for the project and we will carry on systematically work through any other factor that could be slow up the programme or cause the rating to be low the right hon gentleman ask about the timing for the treaty be pleased that there seem to be strong cross party consensus on this as he will know pass such treaty in this house be not particularly complex matter the treaty will be lay before the house and it will be question for the business manager in other country in italy and particularly in the diet in japan there be rather more complicated process so the time limiter be likely to be more on their side than on our they will be look to lay the treaty at their end in the spring and that be more likely to be the issue the right hon gentleman ask about the timing overall it be compressed timetable with specific requirement for it to be in service for which come from the japanese side because of its aircraft replacement programme japan press the target which we be fully sign up to and there be large number of milestone along the way include uk demonstrator aircraft which will be very much soon hope that that information be helpful be happy to write to he with any further detail and to take further question in welcome this project for long term future aircraft may ask the secretary of state whether he agree that the threat picture that will face it will in large measure depend on the outcome of the conflict between ukraine and russia can he say anything to the house about the effort that he and fellow nato member be make to ensure that ukraine have some current aircraft with which to defend itself so as to improve the prospect that will face we when this future aircraft come into be my right hon friend be absolutely right to say that air facility and combat capability be essential to ukraine as we have see that be not just aircraft but unmanned vehicle of all type that be why this aircraft it will be know to some in the house as the tempest which be the name when we originally set off will have the facility to fly unmanned we know that ukraine have choose the we do not fly but to persuade the world to give ukraine aircraft we offer the first training that seem to create situation where other country pitch in we do of course help ukraine in many other way on unmanned aerial vehicle some of which perhaps we will not go into here thank the secretary of state for advance sight his statement the snp welcome this defence co operation between responsible ally that will be take forward the secretary of state rather brush away the question from the labour shadow secretary of state about the billion black hole in the defence equipment budget since the secretary of state mention expansion will he expand on that will he guarantee that other area in defence spending be not to be sacrifice and that they will get the support that be require when will he come to the house to detail how that support will be deliver will come back to that in moment the secretary of state talk about the additional market for this equipment what concern be there about saudi arabia join the programme and the potential use of future combat aircraft in yemen what assessment have be make of the possibility of the programme increase tension with china and worsen the situation in the taiwan strait finally want to come back to finance can the secretary of state detail how the uk will adhere to its treaty commitment if the shortfall in the mod budget increase to billion as project should point out again that it be not shortfall in the budget but snapshot of forecast do before the refresh that be semantic it be not simply for the reason that the project in there may or may not go ahead the large increase in that budget be to do with the nuclear enterprise which we all know the hon gentleman do not approve of in the first place because he do not want we to have that ultimate security of constant nuclear defence at sea we be totally committed to that and will make sure that it always exist the hon gentleman ask good question about saudi or any other country engagement programme of this nature be of great interest to many other nation we receive constant inquiry the saudis have be partner with we in air combat for many decade since margaret thatcher time at this dispatch box we will see how their interest develop he mention yemen in relation to saudi arabia surprisingly he completely fail to mention that houthis from yemen have be attack ship include the british ship hms diamond which fire down one of their unmanned aerial vehicle this weekend the reality as ever be that the hon gentleman misunderstand the global context we will back our raf to have sixth generation aircraft capable of be the good in the world this be really exciting announcement and congratulate the defence secretary as we procure the sixth generation we will become lead nation in advance air capability our world have turn dark corner and have become more angry it be right that we collaborate internationally that be the way forward in upgrade our defence posture he do not mention how many airframe he plan or hop to build perhaps that be deliberate he do mention the we originally want more than of those but we might be lucky to get half that as have be say the world will look very different in and we will need more can he confirm how many of those airframe will be procure do not apologise for say this again and again be it now time to increase our defence budget to thank my right hon friend for his point he be right that have sixth generation aircraft in our fleet will ensure that we keep ahead he will know that typhoons be at four and half and the be very capable fifth generation aircraft our current plan be to have by and another after that for it be not possible right now to provide an exact number of sixth generation aircraft that be yet to be design and build as my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis point out we do not know quite what the shape of air war will be at the time particularly with drone swarm and many other development we do know that air combat will continue to be vital in future and that we will have the good form of air combat available through gcap thank the secretary of state for his statement deliver in his usual never knowingly undersold style welcome the treaty but do he agree that if gcap be to be successful he must ensure that we have vibrant manufacture base in the uk do not know if he be aware or whether his official have brief he but follow the completion of the qatari order at bae systems at warton there be no more manufacturing take place at that site what will he do to fill the gap between deliver the development phase of gcap and the final aircraft it be worth point out that the tempest programme the uk side of gcap already employ people in this country mention that billion have be spend so far and the right hon gentleman will be interested to hear that of those be apprentice he ask about factory run by what be essentially private business or rather not government in bae no it not it be factually true to say that it be private business be go to answer the right hon gentleman question by say that he will perhaps be aware that there be further interest in typhoon around the world can not go into specific but very much hope that it be successful in win that as government we will certainly be fully behind that have the honour of be the prime minister trade envoy to japan the gcap treaty be powerful testament to the very close and like minded relationship between our two country do the secretary of state agree with that it would be helpful if japan be to revise carefully and sensibly the three principle govern its defence technology export to allow gcap to be most effective in today change world mr speaker they speak so highly of my right hon friend in japan that hear of little else while be there last week be very grateful for his work in help to ensure that the gcap treaty come to the conclusion that it do last week he ask about the three principle they be not in japanese law but relate to its cabinet and they determine where and how thing from the defence world can be export when be in japan last week make it very clear that in no small part to help the programme to operate successfully change to the three principle be likely to be need in just the same way that for aukus congress need to make change to allow export to happen between the uk and australia it be very similar situation in tokyo and do gently persuade my opposite number that that will need to be take care of welcome the statement and the treaty set out by the secretary of state one key problem with procure new asset and equipment be that once it be specify lot of change come in far down the line and the cost shoot up give his discussion have he set date for when this asset will be specify what safeguard have he put in place to ensure that it be not continually change therefore delay the project far and add extra cost the hon gentleman will be interested to hear that huge amount of work have be do on thursday in tokyo we receive yet another update from the industry consortium that have be work on the specific of both the concept behind the joint venture and the different aspect of the aircraft performance it be not yet know in detail exactly what those will be the technology be so cut edge that as he know part of the programme be that will be an iterative programme the hon gentleman central point be absolutely right the single great danger be mission creep that keep add on new facility one thing that we as the uk will be say be let get the aircraft fly and stable as valuable asset and then let it iterate or spiral over period of time once it be in service congratulate the secretary of state on the treaty and on form technological partnership with italy and japan to face some of the more difficult challenge in the world the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey say that it be all very well to sign the treaty but it be about the hard work and the skilled work may gently remind my right hon friend that lancashire have the heritage the skill the apprentice and the site do he agree that the good place to put new site would be next to the national cyber force centre in lancashire because of the mixture of skill that would come together beautifully as correct the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey london be not guarantee as the headquarters and think the whole house hear my hon friend valuable pitch for lancashire thank the secretary of state for his positive statement it be good to hear positivity at any time of the year but more so at christmas it be great to hear of the proactive nature of this programme and thank the secretary of state and his team for the hard work that they have do so far note that the north east of england and scotland be see job and engagement will the secretary of state outline how this will enhance skill and labour throughout the united kingdom and particularly in northern ireland which have skilled business workforce and industrial trade just wait to be use we be here for the secretary of state use if he will only give we chance the hon gentleman be absolutely right about the skill that the programme will provide throughout the uk be remind of thales in northern ireland and of how important the next generation light anti tank weapon have be to the battle in ukraine pivotal be tell when speak to my opposite number have no doubt that some of the great skill and brilliance from northern ireland will be part of gcap have be involve in some of the early discussion with italy and japan warmly welcome this treaty and congratulate my right hon friend they be truly excellent partner however he be right in say that if we be to maintain those manufacture basis for decade to come we will need export order may encourage he from the outset not only to look at export from the licensing point of view but to look at the potential for export variant which will allow we to export while also maintain national security thank my right hon friend brilliant minister for defence procurement in former time for what he have say he be entirely right about export do not think we can forget the significance of japan engagement in the programme and congratulate he on his early work on this for japan its involvement be totemic shift from its settlement after the second world war think that over time it be country that be democratic that want freedom and that be on the side of people liberty and right that will need to have this sixth generation aircraft as say in my statement we be live in far more contested world and one in which it be more important than it have be in any recent decade that we have the good capability and those be what this will bring we the secretary of state be clearly very pleased with himself which would presumably account for the unnecessary amount of levity follow statement that be actually very serious pay all tribute to italy and japan for sign the treaty would not trust cheque that this government have sign much less an international treaty but suspect that they take their confidence from mbda from bae systems from rolls royce and from leonardo which be behind this project unlike the uk government who be just sign it off do he agree that it be absolute testament that the beat heart and the brain of this platform come from leonardo facility in edinburgh will he also redouble his effort to bring sweden inside this tent we need sweden for its industrial base and its technological know how and for further order do not think that anyone in the house would accuse the hon gentleman of undue levity and cheerfulness although it be christmas none the less wish he well of course we want to ensure that all our defence company succeed as result of this include those in scotland and who know that could be location for the headquarters as former serviceman and former defence minister too welcome the treaty that the secretary of state have announce what worry though and what worry when be defence minister be slippage under previous government and under this government can the secretary of state assure we that no airframe will be take out of service on the basis of something come in in we need to keep what we have until this be available in the air the date be really the absolute backstop as mention before and not just for we but for our japanese partner who have specific issue with their previous airframe come out of service at that time that is as it be our guide light as for the way in which the royal air force itself decide to operate its airframe in the meantime that be in no small part question of what happen with technology during this period as also mention over the last nearly two year in ukraine we have see the development of air combat at speed that would have seem impossible to we before the ukraine war so would not want to pre empt it entirely while still support my right hon friend principle that we should ensure that we have sufficient airframe operational and in the sky at all time which as the typhoons and the remind we be so very important the gcap be prestigious project that will offer career and high skilled role to people across the global supply chain for decade will my right hon friend commit to keep up the work of the armed force in their support for technical education in our school and college which be critical to make these project big success absolutely will commit to do that my hon friend be right to highlight it be in conversation with my cabinet colleague about how we can maximise the amount of skill not least because we need they for this programme it be matter of great pride that there be already apprenticeship involve in the uk side of this as the world become more dangerous place very much welcome this statement do my right hon friend agree that the global combat air programme be another demonstration of this government commitment to indo pacific security my hon friend be absolutely spot on not only about gcap today but about aukus think that five year ago people would have be surprised to find that we have sign global arrangement with australia and america for nuclear power sub and pillar for aukus and think they would now be surprised to discover that we be bring in treaty to allow for joint aircraft production and research and development with japan this be all sign of our commitment to the indo pacific and to make sure that the waterway and sky around the world remain free and open for commerce and for every country to use welcome this treaty and project which will bring the gcap alongside aukus and the five power defence arrangement at the heart of our indo pacific defence partnership could the secretary of state confirm that this will also secure the future of the supply chain behind typhoon and eurofighter include the landing gear and avionic from gloucestershire by the way gloucestershire airport would make an outstanding choice for project headquarters make declaration of interest here will he also confirm that he will be deploy the prime minister indo pacific focus trade envoy to ensure that other nation in the region be aware of the opportunity that this offer that would also bring we great air compatibility my hon friend be absolutely right about the supply chain there be strong read across between the version of the typhoon and the gcap so it will be important for our defence supply chain particularly when it come to combat aircraft note his pitch for potential hq and also want to thank he publicly for his work in south east asia where he do tremendous job as one of the trade envoy join other in welcome this treaty not just in the defence sense but for the benefit it could bring to the south west region in the light of recent incident with north korea and the rise threat of china can my right hon friend say bit more about how he see this as part of our genuine commitment to stand with our ally if they come under threat we have choice as nation as indeed do the world we see much more aggressive russia invade its neighbour we see china look threateningly towards its neighbour and it be important to understand the dynamic of north korea of iran and of what be happen in the middle east we be undoubtedly live in more contested and more dangerous world and prepare now for the sixth generation fighter combat aircraft be therefore more important than ever this government be entirely commit to secure our future and that of the global order of the world thank the secretary of state for his statement as somebody who represent samlesbury in the ribble valley may give he advance notice that shall be knock on his door shortly infected blood inquiry government response with permission would like to make statement on the government response to the infected blood inquiry make clear my intention to do so at cabinet office question on

government acceptance of the moral case for compensation and understand the call for urgency know that from many of those infected and affect there be anger and frustration with the government response so far the inquiry recommendation be not without complexity and it would be inappropriate for the government to prejudge the finding of the final report for these reason the government be not yet in position to share any final decision on compensation however member on both side of the house have make it clear that we must do right by the victim and the government recognise this be personally committed to make sure that we do that also give enormous credit to the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson on her continue hard work to advocate for the victim

step through an oral statement within sit day of the inquiry final report be publish as my predecessor make clear both to this house and to the inquiry there be number of technical issue that must be

minister do today on report the minister of state in the moj be also definitive in commit that the government will put in place the necessary legislative framework and timescale for delivery body for compensation for the victim of infected blood to be establish in line with the overall objective set report december vol in the amendment table by my right hon friend say to the minister there be no need to wait for the bill to come back or for the inquiry to publish its final report before make the require urgent progress on set up the basis for the compensation scheme the government should make good on the spirit of that commitment and recognise the will of the house not least because commitment to act be also give in the king speech be not suggest for moment that this be not complex matter however as my right hon friend the shadow chancellor and have repeatedly make clear we be open to work on cross party basis to shape compensation scheme that can deliver justice urgently the government should now establish an arm length body to deliver compensation payment which will allow some of the preparatory work to be do while we wait for those final recommendation as with any arm length body the government will be responsible for appoint the chair and the member and set the budget and the rule for the scheme and its administration include on decision making and accountability be also conscious that compensation will apply to those infect in scotland wales and northern ireland and that there be important work to do with devolved government of course welcome what the minister say in his statement about psychological support but will he please tell we why there be need to wait until the summer of next year for it to go live give how long this matter have be go on

to bring forward primary legislation early in the new year to enable the establishment of the compensation scheme give that this house have show its support for that will he also commit to continue to work closely with all the victim group in the future so that their voice be hear throughout the establishment of the compensation scheme to the extent that he have announce timetable today when might people receive the final compensation this be so pressing because on average one person die every four day as result of this scandal will he also give commitment that the government will act on each and every recommendation in the inquiry report he mention statement working day after the publication of that report but he do not give timetable for action on those recommendation will he give that to the house in his response finally will he confirm what preparatory work be be do by the treasury will he commit to be as transparent as possible about that process the government have admit both the case for compensation and the need for urgency this house have show strong cross party support for action it now fall to ministers to deliver urgently thank the right hon gentleman for his constructive approach there be consensus across the house that this urgent matter need to be address as quickly as possible as say at cabinet office question during my second week in post this be the most urgent priority that will face whatever happen in this office and take my responsibility to bring forward the scheme very seriously however we need to examine carefully the amendment that be pass two week ago and how it interact with work that be under way be do everything can to bring that work forward second reading of the victims and prisoners bill will happen today in the other place and the process that will follow from that will be clear in the new year the right hon gentleman ask number of specific question want to deliver psychological support as quickly as possible work closely with nhs england on provision of support and allow people to have direct access to it will do everything can to bring that forward by june at the late hope few month ago make an announcement about clinical legal and social care adviser contact have be make with individual and there will be ongoing conversation to get those people in place as early as possible so as much work as possible can be do along the line have set out the right hon gentleman ask about the recommendation and when people will receive further clarification on government compensation those be substantive matter that will be attend to as quickly as possible in line with what have already say on january the inquiry will issue notification about when that report be expect which will give clarity on the timetable to which we be work assure the house that we be do everything we can to work across relevant departments include the treasury to ensure everything be deliver as quickly as possible call the father of the house mr deputy speaker hope that you realise that after have ask my question and the snp spokesperson the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson and another conservative member have ask their question the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson will be the definitive person to put to government what need to be do say to the minister and through he to our right hon friend the member for horsham jeremy quin the minister predecessor that we be not do enough fast enough how many month have pass since sir robert francis produce his report hope the minister will confirm that it be about month how many month have pass since sir brian langstaff produce his final recommendation on compensation it be about eight month those be the relevant issue the fact that the government will act working day after sir brian final report come out next year do not deal with the issue of what the affected and infected need and should get now if it be question of money how much and the cashflow for the government they should say so now there be nothing that can be say on compensation day after the report come out that could not be say now so please will the minister say it thank my hon friend for his question could not agree with he more about the level of urgency that be attach to the government response he be right about the publication date think the whole house be aware of that in the past five week have take concrete step build on the work of my predecessor to take the action necessary to make those decision as quickly as possible along the timescale have set out can not reiterate enough the government commitment to deal with the issue as quickly as possible and be do all can to gain consensus across government to move thing forward as quickly as possible most of what we have hear today be not new all we be hear from this government be the same old delay while those affect continue to feel let down and fail the government have be work at snail pace on the issue and be sham when they vote against new compensation body for those impact by the scandal those affect and the bereaved will not forgive they for that callous act and the ongoing delay and today they will have those feeling all over again at this non statement on april sir brian langstaff publish his final recommendation relate to compensation crucially he recommend that interim payment be make to bereaved parent and child in respect of death as yet unrecognised to date the government have not respond in practical term to any of those recommendation the government position continue to be to wait for the full report expect next spring before consider whether to extend the compensation that heap insult upon injury to those affect and their family as every four day another victim of this scandal die time be of the essence for those affect to delay this full compensation be to stand against justice and all that be morally and ethically right to delay compensation to those who be literally run out of time be cruel and unnecessary this government need to rethink and listen to the will of this house as express on december in the face of shameful opposition from those on the government benches and deliver justice and full compensation where be the urgency the minister have use the word urgency and urgent several time today but it do not feel to those who be affect that there be any urgency from the government to address the great wrong and loss that they have suffer today give the express will of this house we be hop for timeline from the government for when full compensation body would be establish and operational again sadly all we have be delay and obfuscation do the minister feel no shame in come here today to give statement that say nothing do not accept that characterisation of what have say today as have make number of specific announcement on the progress that be be make neither do accept the characterisation of the government position as callous act this government launch public inquiry and last year we make interim payment accept that substantive response can not happen soon enough but be do everything can work with colleague across government to look at the good way of deliver as quickly as possible and will continue to do so thank the minister for what be now our traditional end of term statement on this subject but to be clear this be one festive tradition that we need to see the back of because people be die without see justice may return the paymaster general to line in his statement where he talk about clinical legal and social care expert to advise he on detailed technical consideration in the new year can he clarify when in the new year because clearly that could cover month of moreover far to the point make by the shadow minister how much can the government do now to pave the way for serious progress and payment when the government and the treasury be in the position to move thank my hon friend for his question have be in discussion on the appointment of clinical legal and social care expert since my first week in office in november we have identify individual and communicate with they last week we want to get they on board with this work in the early day of the new year so that that work can happen as quickly as possible want to avoid situation where people be go out to compete for role what we want be the good people across those specialism so that this work can make urgent progress align with our intention to respond substantively later in the year in april sir brian langstaff say recommend that compensation scheme should be set up now and it should begin work this year what exactly do the minister not understand in that statement this statement today will cause huge anguish to victim of the year old scandal and in note that the prime minister whip conservative members to vote down the new clause on december fuel their suspicion that the government be still play for time even though they accept the moral case this therefore be add one final insult to injury will the minister tell we why the prime minister can find what the deputy prime minister say yesterday be unlimited funding for the rwanda policy but be still push back after five year public inquiry against compensation and even interim compensation for the group that have never receive anything for people who have suffer so much for so long after what the state do to they recognise the right hon lady frustration and disappointment with where we have get to the work that she have do and the work that be express in the amendment be urgently be examine by and my official it be sir brian recommendation recognise sir brian recommendation and have do what can to move we to place where we meet the expectation as quickly as possible in the new year say to the right hon lady when meet she and my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley that my official be engage in look at the option for the delivery vehicle must now examine how that operate with the legislative vehicle which have be amend by the house will do everything that can to update the house as quickly as can have some sympathy for the minister who suspect might go slightly far in his comment if he have complete free rein at the dispatch box have experience of deal with the windrush compensation scheme which similarly look back decade at the impact on individual with record often incomplete and people have move many time and it bring home the complexity of this type of compensation scheme even when it get to work what be his timeline for people to start deal with these case because that will be the first step in get compensation finally pay to people who as we have touch on we be lose literally every day that be what the expert will do the calibration of tariff and allocation of compensation as per the excellent work that have be do by the inquiry this be urgent and work will begin in the new year on that aspect as say on the legislative vehicle to establish the necessary mechanism that process be under way as well the minister have refer many time to urgency think that he be good man and know that he will be try to do his good but have message this afternoon from the organisation factor which say today one of our member have die he be infect with hepatitis through infected factor viii blood product two week ago he be diagnose with cancer cause by his hepatitis and now have die without see justice these story be sadly familiar within our community that be the reality for so many people who have be affect include my own constituent speak to they year ago and be convince of their case for justice who else be hold this up elsewhere in the government the hon gentleman make the right point which we have all hear from our constituent my constituent have make representation along those line too all can say be that there be nothing stop move this forward be do everything that can to put in place the legislative mechanism to set up the process and ensure that when the government respond the response be as comprehensive as it can be acknowledge the distress cause to so many people will do everything that can to bring this forward as quickly as can two week ago meet gentleman call barry barry have be constituent of former member of this place alistair burt in north east bedfordshire barry speak to of how hard alistair have work alongside the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson but of course alistair burt leave this place before we ever find resolution to the scandal can ask my right hon friend who believe be go to do his good whether we will see compensation before any more of we leave this place my right hon friend be ingenious in her question but go back to what say will do everything can to put in place all the element to allow we to respond substantively we will know the date of the report believe on january so we will have definitive timetable in the new year recognise that she alistair burt and many other across the house have campaign on this issue for many year and be determined to bring it to the conclusion that the house expect like many hon member present have number of constituent who be infect with hiv or hepatitis through the scandal and several have lose family member want to echo what some of they be feel one of my constituent describe her parent diagnosis with hiv due to infected blood as catalogue of soul destroy humiliating neglect and ultimately alienate experience and tell that it be now year since her parent die and the intense sense of loss and pain remain profound and be feel every single day people infect and affect need tangible action now to help to alleviate that suffering the question the minister have to answer be when he will establish full compensation body and when that will become operational be obviously go to have to repeat myself several time have set out clearly what be new today the psychological support and the appointment of the necessary expert in matter of day to take forward the work need to get to the point where comprehensive response can happen we have commit to when the timetable will happen with respect to the final inquiry and we be do everything we can to reach that while recognise that that be matter of three or four month far down the road be try to make sure that when the response come it be as comprehensive as it possibly can be address all the dimension of the misery that the hon lady movingly speak about when the house debate the amendment by the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson couple of week ago give the government the benefit of the doubt and abstain if could turn the clock back base on what have hear today would now want to vote for that amendment in couple of week have constituent come to see who be family member of one of the victim be afraid that if show she this statement she would immediately point out thing such as summer and say that be just too long can the minister give some assurance that by the time see that lady there will be little bit more certainty be grateful to my hon friend for his question and will happily talk to he privately be sorry that he draw that conclusion from what have say today in the past day have do everything can to move the scheme forward and want to make an oral statement before the house rise for the recess recognise that there be lot more that could be say but lot more need to be do before we get to that point the reference to june be to do with the psychological support the comprehensive response that the government have commit to will come at define moment after the publication of the final report the date of which we will clarify on january it will be some time after the report publication in march thousand of people across the country have be affect by this scandal and constituent who have be in touch with describe their quest for justice as upsetting frustrating and depress the haemophilia society say after the recent vote on the amendment to the victims and prisoners bill that the prime minister should be ashamed that he have be force to do the right thing do the minister agree with that assessment and will he apologise to those affect for the excessive delay in deliver compensation to victim reaffirm what have say about my commitment to do this as quickly as possible of course regret the delay that have occur over many year and want this to be bring to conclusion as quickly as it can be think neglect to answer the question from the right hon member for torfaen nick thomas symonds about work with the various victim group of which there be large number undertake to work with they to give they as much clarity as possible about the timetable and the work that be undertake will the government be make these payment within their own lifetime will give comprehensive response along the timetable that set out early pay tribute to the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson and to the journalist caroline wheeler for their tireless campaign on this issue think we all know as we have hear in couple of question from conservative members why the government have try to delay compensation for so long they be clearly hop that it will be another government problem perhaps the minister can help to understand he say that he recognise the distress and trauma that each individual have face so why have it take until today to announce bespoke psychological service for people infect and affect by infected blood product and why will it take until the summer to set up that service the timing of the delivery of that service have be work through with nhs england sign off the funding for it when be chief secretary to the treasury and be pleased that we can announce it today wish that it could have be soon but we be where we be and be pleased that we have make some progress as with all these matter of course wish that could accelerate it but have to work through all the deliberate step need to get the legislation in the right place to ensure that we can answer all the question that so many people have recognise they have wait too long thank the minister for his statement particularly his assurance that the scheme will cover the infected and affected have mention my constituent david corroyer in this chamber before he contact hepatitis in the over year ago not from transfusion but from donate blood as needle be use multiple time he give evidence to the inquiry but be still wait to hear whether his particular circumstance will be cover can the minister help he do not think that can be expect to respond to individual case here but have ensure that we have the right range of professional expertise the very well available in this country so that all those different case of infected and affect go off quite range of experience over very long period be properly interrogate as the detail of the scheme be work through the government have to make this statement after lose the vote two week ago but there be little in it for family like the smiths who please know this minister finally see hope in that vote campaigner have call for month and month for the preparatory work to be do how long will victim now have to wait for what the house have ask for as say it will be sitting day after the publication of the report that be when the government comprehensive reply will be give from to be shadow public health spokesman on the opposition benches commit future conservative government to compensate that be easy to do in opposition but accept that it be much more difficult in government trust the minister but know that lot of people be sceptical we need to build back trust by say that we will compensate both those infected and those affect because those family need the money they need it year ago it be not just this government who have be slow previous government have be slow too this need to be resolve now we need to rebuild trust be sorry but it be lack my right hon friend make wise and fair observation this be complex but it be urgent my right hon friend the member for horsham jeremy quin do an enormous amount of work in get we to today statement and to lot more which will come to fruition as quickly as possible but my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning be absolutely right this scandal have last almost two generation and be determined to do everything can to bring it to conclusion the one tradition that have be uphold today be that of the paymaster general come to the house to make statement that say nothing he be the ninth paymaster general since the inquiry be announce and they keep say nothing in the past fortnight alone he have have to face oral question and have be defeat in the voting lobbies and the prime minister be ask question about this on wednesday but we be still no nearer where we need to be this be cruel cruel tease be it not be sorry but do not accept that characterisation what would say be that as think the hon member appreciate there be deeply complex matter in relation to how to allocate fund in the right way and create the most effective and reliable way to honour the recommendation and deal with this comprehensively and be do everything can to make sure that be achieve all of we here be unhappy about the fact that this have take so long the event actually take place up to year ago but my right hon friend have react very strongly to the conversation and other have have with he since the original statement what he have outline today about the final report the bespoke psychological service and some technical issue follow by serious announcement for those of our constituent who have suffer or have partner who have since die and the personal commitment he have give to resolve this during be useful step forward be grateful to he for make this statement before the christmas recess be grateful to my hon friend for his word the right hon member for kingston upon hull north say at business question last thursday that she do not want write statement on the last day do not think that have an oral statement on the penultimate day be that much well but be determined to at least address that concern what will commit to be do as much as can to update the house as early as possible that commitment be there and obviously we have cabinet office question early in the new year the day after the announcement of the date and will hope be able to say more then sir brian langstaff come up with the recommendation that he do because he recognise that people be die without get justice the amendment that be pass in this house two week ago table by my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson be sir brian recommendation word for word the minister have come to the dispatch box sound as though he have only just start work on this and that there be no work do by his nine predecessor have he meet sir brian langstaff and what do sir brian langstaff say to he about this constant delay in pay compensation have not meet sir brian langstaff yet but of course build on the work that my predecessor have do as indicate to the chair of the all party parliamentary group as soon as be in office set up meeting and be aware of the ongoing work now have to work out the interaction of that amendment with the work that exist and bring forward substantial response to it this be disappointing statement in some way but let give the paymaster general an opportunity to build trust and confidence it be unclear in his statement whether the government accept the principle of an independent compensation body an arm length body so can he confirm that that be the case do he accept that for the victim and their family that be prerequisite for build trust and confidence and that they will not accept government department involve in this scandal administer the compensation scheme be very cognisant of the recommendation and the sensitivity about the trust need in the delivery mechanism whatever that be that be one of several consideration on which we need to reach the right conclusion as my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning say recognise that restore trust be serious matter on which we have to deliver my constituent eileen lose her father in the infected blood scandal she tell early this year this lack of transparency be cause great stress and anxiety to those of we at the heart of this nhs treatment disaster who have already wait decade for our loss and suffering to be recognise when the government commit to statement before christmas there be an expectation that there would have be further progress on the compensation scheme and do not think that be an unreasonable assumption in the absence of that what assurance can give eileen and her family that she will be recognise by this government and that she will be compensate today we be put in place the expertise need to deal with the recommendation and look at the distribution for compensation the government be commit to respond after those sit day from the day that the report be publish the date of which will be know on january what have announce today be milestone on that journey and we be in that last lap as we get towards the day when the government will respond substantively my constituent lose her brother and her sister in law and her nephew be orphan at young age her mother pensioner be leave to raise her nephew the family have not receive penny and her nephew be in dire need of support as everybody have say this be already too late so urge the minister to do everything in his power to ensure that something be do soon rather than later will he explain exactly what new legislation he need to bring in some ex gratia payment have be make since but recognise that large number of people have be exclude in different way the work that will be undertake and the expert who have be appoint will be design to ensure that the fair settlement be make take full account of the inquiry recommendation can not offer any specific assurance to the hon lady or her constituent but will be do everything can to bring this forward as quickly as can my constituent michael and so many more will be disappoint by today statement the minister rightfully speak about urgency yet there be no timeline that reflect that urgency people still do not know when the independent compensation body will be set up or when they will ultimately get justice and get that compensation to victim of this infected blood scandal recognise the hon gentleman disappointment and that of many in the house today shall reflect carefully on that and do everything can to do well next time the step we be take deliberately and carefully to work through what be require to make substantive response after the publication of that final report in march be serious will be have meeting over christmas and early in the new year week by week to work through what be require to deliver on the government commitment speak about last could sort of reference some of the thing the minister have refer to well if only could only wish be able to and could talk of complex matter the victim want to hear clear timeline for when final compensation payment will be make they want to see the urgency that the minister talk about there be view that the government be try to kick this issue into the next parliament and that the treasury be drag its heel the minister have be ask this couple of time will he confirm that this issue will be all resolve before this parliament be dissolve that be my expectation be do everything can to bring this to substantial conclusion after the publication of the final report be speak to colleague in many departments and work with official across government to get to the end point that have set out several time this afternoon thank the paymaster general for his statement know he be an honourable gentleman and his commitment will be to deliver what we wish to see also thank the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson for the amendment that she table and win in this house by four vote those four vote be enough to show the mind of this parliament and where we want to be during the last topical question to the cabinet office ask the paymaster general whether he have the figure for those who have sadly pass away this year before compensation have be make available to they the minister commit to confirm those number so two week later and with no reply have he be able to access the figure ask for as we approach the rise of the house for christmas be not aware whether those figure be available yet but will ensure that the moment leave this chamber will do everything can to get the hon member response on that if can not give they will let he know why thank the minister for his statement and for respond to question for minute tackle spike with permission will make statement about the government action to tackle spike spike be an insidious act with potentially life threaten consequence we know it constitute danger to people particularly woman in nightclub bar on student campus at festival or in any social setting no one should have to worry that substance have be put into their drink or that they could be target with needle more than case be report last year and that be perhaps only the tip of the iceberg these offence have potentially devastating effect first there be the immediate physical effect which can include struggle to speak or to stand up loss of consciousness and hospitalisation to name just few secondly there be the psychological trauma which can manifest itself in number of way include anxiety or most acutely shame about what happen and what may have ensue the impact can last for month year or lifetime some will be victim of secondary offending which they may struggle to recall that may well be of sexual nature thames valley police tell the home secretary and just last friday that spike be the hallmark of the sexual predator anyone who have read the harrowing account of victim will understand why it be vital that we crack down on these crime we owe it to all of they to redouble our effort and that be precisely what this government be do as member will be aware the government be require under section of the police crime sentencing and courts act to produce report on the nature and prevalence of spike and the action we intend to take publication have be delay and understand why the hold up have be source of frustration but that delay have enable the home secretary and both new in post to take step back and consider how good we can focus our effort to address this crime we want the law to be crystal clear and for individual to have no doubt as to their right and remedy we have conclude that there be case for legislative change to capture the modern and insidious nature of this crime can therefore confirm to the house that the government intend to bring forward amendment to the criminal justice bill that modernise the language of the offences against the person act this will remove any ambiguity and make it clear that the offence cover spike in every form be that via food or drink vape or by needle we hope that this step will improve public awareness but most importantly encourage victim to come forward will add two point it have be say and we of course accept that the exist law already cover the range of behaviour that incorporate spike while it be not in dispute that that be the case we recognise that some of the exist offence on which we rely be not readily see to cover spiking we give the illustration of section to of the offences against the person act which use the language of poisoning for nefarious purpose which we believe we can clarify through this change by their very nature spike case be complex the work we have do tell we that there be particular challenge in identify perpetrator and gather evidence to bolster our legislative plan we have develop package of practical measure to improve public safety the police have already develop rapid lab base urine testing capability but we want to go far first the home office will be fund effort to research the capability and reliability of exist rapid drink testing kit there be never any guarantee with this sort of work and we be only at the beginning but to understand what be possible we have to gather evidence on test efficacy and that be what we will be do in the month ahead secondly additional funding will be provide to the police to run several spike intensification week which we have see successfully deploy for other type of criminality include county line and knife crime thirdly the security industry authority the regulator of the uk private security industry have commit to introduce spike training for door supervisor as part of its exist licence link qualification this will enable they to well and more quickly identify victim onsite fourthly we will support the police to roll out their spike reporting and advice tool to improve the quality of datum this enable the public to report case of spike quickly and simply include anonymously if they so wish it have be successfully roll out across force as part of pilot programme in england and wales and will be expand to the remain force shortly several other measure be detail in the statutory report but be conscious of the time so will simply add that the report be available on the website and emphasise that we be strengthen our response across the board before conclude take this opportunity to urge the public to remain vigilant particularly over christmas if anybody believe that they or someone around they have be spike they should report the incident to the venue and the police also want to offer my thank to the campaign group stamp out spiking and members on both side of the house will not mention they all but particularly thank my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford the hon member for bradford south judith cummins my right hon friend the members for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes and for witham priti patel my hon friend the member for mid sussex mims davies and the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson who have campaign so assiduously on this issue their insight and commitment have be instrumental and they will no doubt continue to provide support and scrutiny as our work progress spike be an appalling predatory crime that ruin life as we have show time and again this government will do everything in their power to protect the public and reduce violence against woman commend this statement to the house thank the minister for advance sight of her statement once again welcome she to her role she have be long stand advocate for action on tackle violence against woman and girl and be confident that there will be opportunity to work together to make progress on these incredibly important issue let we be clear labour completely welcome today announcement on spike although action to crack down on this dangerous and devastating crime be long overdue the scale of the problem as the minister well know be vast as the government own report make clear between may and april the police receive report of spike of those just in charge on average we have report month with the majority come from female who believe their drink be spiked although spiking can affect anyone some of the more than report include needle spike spike be dangerous and invasive crime that create both immediate physical danger for victim and long term psychological impact the word in the statement be all well and good and the minister know she have my full support but we must also recognise that this government record on issue relate to violence against woman and girl have be one of dither and delay strong action be always welcome but why have it take the government so long to act the home affairs committee publish its report on spike in april which be more than year and half ago labour have repeatedly call for action on spike include the creation of stand alone criminal offence that would make it easy to prosecute easy to raise awareness and easy for people to come forward to report what have happen and point to crystal clear breach of the law there have be year of campaigning and advocacy about the epidemic of spike here in the uk but once again the government have sadly drag their foot since the select committee publish its report there have be two fresher week two year of festive party and two year of music festival during that period more victim have be leave vulnerable to this awful crime where be the urgency when it come to tackle violence against woman and girl the government response have be pitifully slow the report publish by the government today on the nature and prevalence of spiking which be require as part of the police crime sentencing and courts act be originally due to be publish on april nine month ago but have be delay time and again that simply be not good enough in the month of delay dangerous criminal will have be let off and victim have be consistently let down while it be positive that the government be now bring forward legislative change to create more clarity about the criminality of spiking it have take too long for they to accept the significance of the problem last year the national police chiefs council tell the home affairs committee that poor datum quality and the absence of clear criminal offence present challenge in police spike it say more define standalone offence of spike would help understand the scale of the problem and enable far more accurate picture to be realise than through the current approach chief constable tell the committee that define offence for spike would also allow enhanced support for victim but last december in response to the committee report the then safeguard minister the hon member for derbyshire dales miss dines say we have conclude that there be no gap in the exist law which new offence would fill and that introduce new specific spike offence would not increase the likelihood of charge or prosecute an offender for spike offence yet we now understand that there will be legislative amendment to update and modernise exist offence to make the offence explicit and capture the modern day nature of the threat the minister have acknowledge whilst the offence be nominally cover by exist law this comprise patchwork of different law some now well over hundred year old which be draft to cover other kind of offending that be clear admission that the current legal framework be not fit for purpose but it have take the government more than month to accept and put forward change to rectify that the minister have make personal commitment in her new role to go far than her predecessor and commend she for that but labour remain concerned that these tweak to exist law will fall short of do the right thing of create stand alone spike offence we fear that the government approach simply will not go far enough and will not provide the clarity and focus require for all involved that be say we will eagerly await the detail of any amendment and will scrutinise the propose legislative change in committee the government be right to say in their report that night time economy venue be area of opportunity for safeguarding and prosecutorial support and that the early collection of evidence identification of perpetrator and the ability to support customer be key there be no doubt that as well as get the criminal justice system to take spike more seriously we need much more prevention work in club bar and pub and joint working between premise and the police to catch perpetrator the government new training plan sound like step in the right direction but we be concerned about the small scale of the new programme the announcement talk about train hundred more door staff but we know that there be ten of thousand of venue up and down the uk where these crime be be commit regularly how on earth do the minister expect even to scratch the surface of the issue with those number we urgently need to see more detail to understand how impactful the change will be for example can the minister set out exactly how the new training will work include how many venue will receive training whether it will be voluntary or mandatory and what happen if venue fail to engage or repeatedly ignore spike incident at their premise we need robust and comprehensive approach across the country this should not be opt in we also need proper national strategy for deal with this abhorrent crime which would include look at the licensing arrangement for late night venue where these crime take place tackle spike at its root be huge challenge the government have have year to get it right but the simple truth be that the tories have be too focused on their own in fighting rather than tackle issue such as spiking which pose genuine risk to woman up and down the country urge the minister to be bold in her commitment know that she will be and sincerely hope that she will work hard to rebuild the trust that woman and girl have lose over the last decade when it come to feel safe in our community will come back on two or three of the hon lady point first on the hon lady observation that few such case result in charge if may correctly she gently the principal reason the police have give for that be too few people come forward in the first place which we hope this legislative change will address the narrow window of time in which urine sample can be accurately test which be one reason why we be fund further research into rapid on site testing and the difficulty in establish who be do the spiking simply the difficulty that we have identify and speak to the police about come at every level in the process we be change the law to make spike crystal clear so that public confidence be improve and victim feel encouraged to come forward because that be the first bit of the jigsaw secondly on the scale of our response from the bouncer on the door of the club in the small town to the statute book we want to change the response to spike at every level whether it be question of friend report an incident victim come forward test be do more rapidly or the police have any doubt about which of the provision under statute apply it will be crystal clear thirdly the hon lady talk about develop an accurate picture of where spiking take place and how we develop the response accordingly that be the focus of the reporting tool which member of the public can use to report an incident of spike even if they be not affect and it appear to have happen to someone at table on the other side of the room the tool will enable the police to develop an accurate picture some of which we already know some we be less clear about to see the extent of it where it happen and how we can focus resource my hon friend will know that last week there be debate in westminster hall on this subject afterwards speak to dawn dines at stamp out spiking and have an email from colin mackie of spike aware who make the point that none of we have mention vape spike that be our omission and be pleased that this afternoon it have not be the minister as she include it we need century solution to century crime could the minister expand little about perpetrator we know that spiking be do for variety of reason perhaps to effect sexual assault physical assault or robbery or just for entertainment particularly to humiliate individual what other step be the government take alongside this legislative clarity which welcome to ensure that those people who still think it be okay to humiliate embarrass and assault woman get clear message that it be culturally unacceptable thank my right hon friend for her typically wise question she be right to mention the vape issue which be not previously aware of that prove the point that whatever legislative change we make will have to be fit for the future and envisage how the crime might evolve and develop over time she make good point about perpetrator that be exactly what thames valley police tell the home secretary and on friday critical part of the vawg strategy that it and the police nationally focus on be perpetrator behaviour as part of licensing condition the police increasingly work with bar staff who make note to establish who be behave in certain way in the bar and who be often on their own or look to isolate people use cctv can be critical first step in the police identify the perpetrator where they be work which location they frequent and who pose the great risk to woman in local community welcome today statement and pay tribute to all those who have campaign for change in spike law but it be almost month since the home affairs committee produce our report and more than seven month since the statutory deadline for the government to publish their own report on the issue be miss the report tell we that the government be still consider many of the committee recommendation include the gathering of vital datum on crime recording and perpetrator option for the delivery of training programme for the night time economy and option for joint communication on spike include work with festival ahead of summer event and engage with university over fresher week as the report be late can the minister explain why it have not accept the clear full recommendation on all these point and why there be still consideration go on in the home office pay tribute to all the right hon lady work individually and as part of the home affairs committee do not want she to be leave with the impression that there be lack of complete commitment on this issue as hint at in the statement and for the purpose of brevity some training happen already for bar staff there be probably gap with how much those work on the door know and they be critical first responder to these case which be why mention they she should not interpret anything in this report as evidence of lack of ambition by the government my statement today be to assure she that we have give this issue our full commitment chelmsford be home to vibrant night time economy with lot of very popular bar club and restaurant we also have really strong reputation for be safe place to enjoy night out but from time to time even in chelmsford story of spike come to light therefore warmly welcome this package of initiative in particular the promise to modernise the law to make it crystal clear that spike whether in drink through needle or via vape be illegal it be very timely as the criminal justice bill be go through parliament right now and we can put it into law quickly do the minister agree with and very many campaigner that clarify the law will act as strong deterrent to perpetrator and thus help keep woman safe absolutely agree with my right hon friend and thank she for her question first as say the purpose of clarify the law be to empower more people to be clear on their right and to come forward but it be also the case that by have clear offence in which spiking be define the police will be able to use the datum of people who come forward and report spike incident that will allow we to build much more accurate picture through the criminal justice system of the extent to which this offence occur thank the minister for the statement welcome any measure to tackle this awful crime of spiking so look forward to the government amendment to the criminal justice bill the national police chiefs council have state that stand alone offence would help it to understand the scale of the problem enable more accurate picture to be realise and allow enhanced support for victim will she outline her reason for ignore the npcc concern and miss clear opportunity to create stand alone offence of spike it be welcome news that as she have just state hundred of door staff will be train to change the response to spike at every single level but be at loss as to the logic for why the government have not include training for staff at outdoor music festival where ten of thousand of under year old attend often camp out and where private security firm be task with their safety will the minister extend the training to outdoor music festival staff in order to protect our young people thank the hon lady for her question and for all her work on this issue think we be argue on two side of the same coin we agree without reservation that there be need to define spike in law and that be what we be commit to do effectively it could be view as an offence which will enable people to report clearly and the police to record datum in the way that have suggest essentially there be no particular difference between where the npcc be and where we be on this issue hope that will satisfy she encourage she to have look at the report itself the ambition be very much to work with staff at every level we be in no doubt about who the frontline responder be yes festival be primary location as be student campus of course bar staff come into this the direction of travel be absolutely to further their work in recognise and ultimately if our research go far perhaps play role in testing and support the police effort on this particular crime this be the good early christmas present for thousand of our constituent who have be spiked and the many ten of thousand who worry that they may be spiked it be testimony to the new safeguarding minister that in my hon friend first statement to the house she have announce the updating and modernising of the offences against the person act which so many of we who have be campaign on this issue believe be overdue she have do this in the presence of both the home secretary and the lord chancellor both of whose unwavering support on this matter much appreciate will my hon friend tell the house when she believe it might be possible to start the process of training when we might be able to expand the roll out of the police report pilot project and when we might expect to get an early report back on the result of the drink testing kit which be so important to successful implementation pay tribute to my hon friend for the exceptional work that he have do in drive this forward work with ministers and explain to we issue that we may not have consider previously think that be one of the good example of mps and hope government work together along with other mp of course my hon friend ask very properly question about the reporting and the timeframe do not have an answer for he but will take his question back to my official and see whether we can set sensible timetable for when he and other can expect some report from the home office on what be be do how effective it be and what difference it will make on the question of update legislation everyone who have read the publish report will be aware that there be difference of opinion with some police officer express the belief that exist law cover this offence however in the life of the current parliament there have be other important way in which we have change the law when some would have say that an offence be already cover one example be non fatal strangulation have speak to criminal barrister who say they be secure conviction for that offence in circumstance in which they would not have necessarily do so in the past and hope that we will see the same difference in this instance welcome some of what the minister have announce when the national police chiefs council run data collection for spike incident at festival and other event last year they find that the average age of spike victim be just with some victim shockingly as young as we know that spike victim be disproportionately young woman and it be therefore vital that we tackle sexist attitude early be proud that some of the school in my constituency be take innovative approach but may ask the minister to commit to work with her colleague in the department for education to improve and strengthen the sex and relationship education curriculum in particular will they look at the recommendation from woman aid for reform of the curriculum so that it directly address misogyny and violence against woman be glad that the hon lady have ask that question because have have discussion with woman aid and ministers in the department for education very recently to discuss exactly that have form the view that there be strong imperative for we to look carefully at how we teach child about relationship and about attitude on these subject at the start of secondary school and even think at the end of primary school once these issue develop they be much more difficult to shift and the key be to prevent they from develop in the first place there be some good precedent for that be highly effective in other area which be what be explore at the moment warmly welcome my hon friend to the dispatch box for what believe be her first statement the first of many be certain be alarmed to hear in the statement that the case report last year be perhaps only the tip of the iceberg will the reporting tool enable anonymised case to be report so that we can have well sense of the scale of this crime thank my right hon friend for his kind word yes absolutely that be key feature of the reporting tool the purpose be partly to address some of the issue that prevent people come forward they do not think they will be believe or they think that they make fool of themselves or they can not really remember what happen on the night the ability to report the incident use an anonymous tool without have to go through the entire criminal justice process if that be not what the victim wish to do be an important element it have be pilot very successfully in force so far we hope that it will encourage people to come forward and will also help we to develop an accurate picture of what be happen across the country have to say that be surprise by the rapid onslaught of both the spiking of drink and the use of needle do not know many young woman who do not put their the hand over their glass when they be out hope that be not be pedantic but want to press the minister will spike be stand alone offence she have talk about its being effectively see as an offence and about modernise the language but it be extremely important for it to be stand alone offence can she please commit herself to that let be completely clear about this we will be amend the offences against the person act so that the language of an exist statutory provision will capture the modern offence of spike in all its form because we recognise that the language in that act although it nominally cover the offence of spiking will not be clear to member of the public thank the minister for her statement very serious and worrying case have be raise with locally but know that this be widespread national problem so strongly welcome these measure and pay tribute to the minister and all who have campaign on the issue may return to the answer she give on the ability to report anonymously do she agree that that be critical both to gain well understanding of what be go on and the scale of the problem and to make it easy for people to come forward and report do indeed think that the ability to report anonymously be critical part of this hope the use of that tool on national basis will mean that people become accustomed to be able to report these incident and that as result they be report more widely hope that today statement will generate publicity and that we will collectively make this an offence that people will feel much more ready to come forward and report welcome the minister statement brighton have thriving night time and entertainment economy that be what we be base on but far too many people know personally have be spike predominantly woman when they try to get test via the health service very often the pathway be close to they will the minister ensure that pathway to testing be available not just through the criminal justice system but through the health system and that it will be licensing requirement for venue to direct people to the right place to safety and then the criminal justice system will she also ensure that licensing rule be focus on people safety hear many report that licensing rule prevent people from take glass out of venue to get some air so they leave the glass inside and leave themselves open to danger some of this need to be change but outdated licensing rule prevent that from happen and end up put people at risk the hon gentleman have make three excellent suggestion will take they all back and write to he these measure will be welcome by the police who have be call for they for many year when be policing minister they be start to inquire about this most important however be the fact that we worry about our love one when they go out my daughter live in sydney australia and spiking be rife there too hear an alarm bell ring when the minister speak about testing be former roads minister as well as former policing minister when first introduce the concept of drug driving the response be oh this be very difficult and technical because there be so many different drug there be discussion of urine testing and how that could be do the saliva test lead to the prosecution of most drink driver and drug driver who be stop the type approval that the home office be look for need to be very open minded the industry will come forward with the technology the minister will be tell that it be very expensive tough the more we use it the more the price will come down be grateful to my right hon friend for his wise observation hope that he be able to infer from my statement that what currently exist be urine test that the police can roll out on more than one occasion the police have tell that they be sometimes inhibit by the fact that even if they do the test it be not within the window when the drug be still in the bloodstream so they do not obtain an accurate reading the reason the home office be fund research on rapid drink testing test it be still at an early stage be that hopefully it will be possible to test the drink on site if someone report symptom the venue will be able to work out very quickly what might have happen use kit and the path to redress for the victim can begin on the night itself thank the minister for her statement but urge she to go much far in tackle this terrible crime in particular ask she to look again at further work at music festival thousand of vulnerable young people attend the reading festival in my constituency many of they teenager it would be good to hear that work be under way to protect they and other young people at such festival would like to write to the hon gentleman have say the same to other about what we be do in relation to festival but the reading festival resonate and not just because my constituency be nearby when speak to thames valley police about this issue recently they say that the reading festival be not just festival where they see spike but the festival where they see the high correlation with secondary offence namely sexual offence that be perpetrate afterwards the hon gentleman do not need to impress on the urgent need for we to look specifically at festival as particular danger zone for this type of crime very much welcome my hon friend statement and her clear determination to stamp down on this evil crime she mention the police intensification week which suspect will be very successful largely down to the use of police power to stop and search in venue in order to find spike paraphernalia on the perpetrator however in the long term there will be need for training of door staff and bar staff as she mention can she give commitment that if further power need to be hand down in very limited scope to door staff be it at music festival nightclub or late night venue she will not rule that out to ensure that these crime can be prevent in the first place my hon friend be quite right spike intensification be form of training that develop how the police think about this issue but it be likely that it will have to be complement by what happen among door staff and bar staff as mention in my statement we have have feedback from the police that additional power in both regard would be helpful to they and we be give serious consideration to that spike be such degrading crime remember the sense of shame feel by the victim deal with when be take down the report of the offence as sexual offence operational police officer we need to change the culture in the long term so that perpetrator do not even think about commit such offence and commend the university of st andrews in my constituency for its consent module in that vein we need to look at how we can actively prevent these offence and welcome the proposal for door staff training will the minister give consideration to the amendment to the victims and prisoners bill table by my hon friend the member for edinburgh west christine jardine on mandatory training for certain police officer and the crown prosecution service in relation to violence against woman and girl the hon lady be right to say that spiking be form of violence against woman the data be irrefutable the principal victim be young and predominantly woman it be classic gateway offence by somebody who be at risk of go on to commit much more serious form of offending so this be not just about stamp out the crime it be about make it impossible for perpetrator to behave in this way in the first place the hon lady talk about the police training and want to provide she with some reassurance hope be answer her question when say that we now have police officer in england and wales who be undergo specific rape and serious sexual offence raso training meet some of they on visit to bristol recently and be due to see more in the new year would be happy to update she on how that be go and how effectively think it be be roll out across force in this country want to put on record my thank to the new minister for her rapid work in this area and to colleague who have work so hard to secure these change to our spike law will she join in thank braunton councillor pru maskell and barnstaple soroptimists for their campaigning to tackle spiking and their promote the use of spikey bottle top and stop top for glass in north devon what brilliant idea of course thank the local organisation that my hon friend mention this have be collective effort perhaps represent parliament be at its good when so many mp have work with their local authority or local charity or have hear the voice of victim who have come to see they in their surgery and relay all that into government we have draw all that information together and get to where we be today but honestly without the testimony and hard work of so many local group such as the one she mention we probably would not be here now thank the minister very much for the second good news story that we have hear today in this chamber we be very pleased to have that can also thank the hon member for gloucester richard graham and for bradford south judith cummins and other in this house who have contribute to this potential legislation it be great to hear these announcement on tackle spike especially as we approach the christmas period when so many young people and elderly people as well be attend christmas party and event across the whole of the united kingdom as understand it the change to the legislation will apply to the police force in england and wales the minister refer to case on the uk mainland just to give she an idea of the impact in northern ireland we have case there in one month will she ensure that discussion take place with the police service of northern ireland and the relevant government departments to ensure that we in northern ireland can adopt this same legislation and keep our people safe as well be rapidly do the math and it look as though the scale of the problem in northern ireland be at the same level as it be everywhere else in the country will make note that we undertake to work carefully with that force and ensure that there be standardisation across the united kingdom congratulate the minister on tackle this issue and my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham on his persistence in bring it to her attention sussex police actively help to prevent spike by provide anti spike drink cover and stop top and by use drone in brighton where there be four university to act as mobile form of cctv can the minister provide further detail on how the home office will work with the national police chiefs council to target key week when spike tend to be more prevalent in order to crack down on the number of incident and to ensure that police force share good practice to avoid postcode lottery pay tribute to my hon friend who have be really vocal on this issue and deserve credit for everything she have do on it she make two excellent point the first be about whether the home office would respond to flashpoint time period such as fresher week think that that be absolutely within our purview and it be set out in the spike report which hope she have have an opportunity to read the second be about good practice and that be an excellent point on which hope to update the house over the course of next year we can create as many new offence or practice as possible in this house but unless they be be apply evenly across every force we can not be sure that they be work as well as they should be hope my hon friend will continue to scrutinise the government on that issue in the month ahead hugely welcome this statement from the minister and thank the government for take strong positive action on tackle the horrific crime of spiking which affect young and old people include student and non student and hugely negatively impact public safety can my hon friend reassure the house and the public at large that the police and hospitality business will be support to well detect this crime and so ultimately bring these perpetrator to justice can provide my hon friend with that reassurance the critical part of our response today be that we be work at every single level from the barman to the bouncer to the statute book we recognise it as critical that people be protect when they be out at night and if they have cause to go to the police the follow day our objective be to stamp out spike would like to thank the minister for her statement and for respond to question for over minute be now go to seamlessly hand

go far to improve animal welfare just this year we have bring forward compulsory cat microchipping and we be ban the keeping of primate as pet today mark another step forward in deliver well welfare for the animal in our care as the animal welfare livestock exports bill will end unnecessary journey abroad for slaughter take advantage of brexit freedom we can now legislate to end this trade which we be unable to do for so many year due to european union trade rule if may have the liberty of say so be sure that mr deputy speaker would be speak enthusiastically in support of the bill if he be not in the chair because of his commitment to animal welfare the secretary of state have just say that this be brexit freedom and very much remember it be trumpet during the brexit campaign but that be more than seven year ago by the time this bill become law it will be eight year what have take he so long would have think the hon lady would welcome the fact that we be able to legislate for so many year member of this house call for the ability to prevent live export but we be not able to do so where agree with she be on mr deputy speaker support for animal welfare which be recognise across the house want to take moment to acknowledge member who have champion this important issue over number of year which speak to the hon lady point in particular recognise my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay who have repeatedly lobby on this issue and indeed in propose private member bill to amend the harbours docks and piers clauses act to allow port and local authority to ban live export recognise my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers who also actively champion ban include in table private member bill to prohibit live export although her proposal do not make it on to the statute book they remind the house of the public concern on this important issue and indeed help to lay the groundwork for the bill before we today also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for west dorset chris loder who have champion this issue both within the department and within this house indeed there have be numerous debate during which many member on both side of the chamber have speak passionately about end live export reflect the strong support in the country for ban also thank the tireless campaigner whose effort have help to raise awareness of this issue among hon member and the wide public particularly the rspca and compassion in world farming which have both actively campaign on this issue over many decade as well as world horse welfare which be found in to stop the export of horse for slaughter live animal export have be focus of campaign by animal welfare charity for more than year indeed in the when million of animal be export for slaughter each year several legal challenge seek to ban live export these challenge be unsuccessful not least because as member of the eu we be bind by eu rule on animal welfare during transport which prevent the house from act thank the secretary of state for chat to early the export of live animal somewhat suggest travel by sea and because we do not have an abattoir on the isle of wight we have to export animal to the uk for slaughter before bring they back there be potentially more humane way of deal with animal one of which would be to have small scale abattoir on the isle of wight on the current small scale abattoir programme the government be work only with current abattoir and abattoir owner will the secretary of state meet to discuss how we can get small scale abattoir on the isle of wight so that we can enjoy the spirit as well as the de jure benefit of this excellent bill my hon friend raise an important point the government have commit million of additional investment through the small abattoir fund recognise the importance of reduce animal journey time as we have discuss separately be happy to meet he to discuss what more we can do in the context of small abattoir particularly recognise the specific issue of geography in his constituency warmly thank my right hon friend for his kind comment about my long term involvement it be great that we no long have eu barrier but how can we be sure that we will not run into world trade organisation issue what work have he do to ensure that the bill survive any potential challenge on trade ground draw attention to my right hon friend long campaigning and will return if may to the trajectory of this issue before address her point call for ban intensify after when the animal and plant health agency intercept consignment of sheep due to sail from the port of ramsgate and sheep be humanely kill after be find unfit to travel welcome that since the we have see export number decline significantly in around sheep be export from great britain to the eu for slaughter and around sheep be export for fatten be pleased to say that thank to the uk exit from the eu there have be no record export for slaughter or fatten from great britain to the eu since january and now be the time to enshrine that in law thank the secretary of state for make the point that from there have be no further export for slaughter my farmer be concerned about reproduction can he clarify whether the bill be just about slaughter what can be do about the gene pool by make sure that people be still allow to trade genetic material across the world in order to strengthen stock my hon friend characteristically raise pertinent point which will address he be right to draw distinction between export for slaughter and wide breeding programme particularly in the horse industry give the demand from europe slaughterhouse for livestock especially british sheep there be no reason to think that this trade would not resume at the first opportunity if we do not legislate now to ban live export that be why we must put an end to this unnecessary trade long journey time can lead to host of animal welfare issue include stress exhaustion dehydration and injury the journey that once take young unweaned calf from great britain to spain for fatten be find to last on average hour and in some case over hour warmly welcome the bill on which the department have be work for some time this measure be big component of the animal welfare kept animals bill in the last session this bill send very important message internationally because where the uk lead on animal welfare other country often follow my right hon friend will be aware that some of the bad problem and the long journey relate to livestock go from australia to the middle east for slaughter do he share my hope that the australian government will learn from this british example and modernise their law to end that trade my right hon friend raise an extremely important point in large measure that international leadership come from the leadership he show when he be secretary of state in place animal welfare at the forefront of the approach take by the government and the department hope other country will look at that approach and at the benefit it will bring his leadership be very good illustration of that as my right hon friend will recall even the short direct to slaughter export journey from britain to continental europe in take hour the uk government along with the scottish and welsh governments commission the farm animal welfare committee to examine and report on animal welfare in the transporting of livestock its report draw on range of source rise before update the house on that important point will of course give way thank the secretary of state and as have not have the opportunity to do this yet wish he well in the position he now hold he understand as be sure almost everyone in this chamber do that the farmer love his animal and want to do what be good for they what discussion have he have with the national farmers union and the ulster farmers union about this issue ever mindful that the farmer wish to do what be good for their animal could not agree more with the hon gentleman that farmer care passionately for the welfare of their animal similar point arise where one often see the debate on nature and sustainable farming set up as if those thing be in conflict do not think they be think that farmer be the custodian of the land and want to pass it on to future generation in well health with well soil quality than before they have similar approach to animal welfare issue farmer care for their livestock which be why so many of they will welcome the measure we be take today be just touch on the report by the farm animal welfare committee commission by the uk scottish and welsh governments which include expert opinion through stakeholder engagement the response to call for evidence on welfare in transport and systemic review conduct by scotland rural college and the university of edinburgh the report identify several aspect of transport that have detrimental effect on animal welfare such as the stress of unfamiliar surrounding vehicle motion confinement and poor ventilation the report express concern about lengthy journey recommend that animal should be transport only when necessary in line with the government manifesto commitment and follow the fawc report in we undertake public consultation with the welsh government on ban live export the strength of public feeling against live export be clearly demonstrate we receive more than response to that consultation show that the public care deeply about this issue some of respondent agree that livestock and horse should not be export for slaughter and fattening and now be the time to lock in ban to permanently end those unnecessary export journey the bill core provision prohibit the export of relevant livestock from great britain for slaughter and make do so an offence the bill be focus on ban live export where major animal welfare concern have be identify accordingly it legislate to end all export from or transit journey through great britain of cattle sheep pig goat and horse for fatten and slaughter it may be helpful to speak to the issue raise by my hon friend the member for bosworth dr evans and set out briefly what the bill do not prohibit the bill still allow export of livestock include horse for other purpose such as breeding show and competition provide the animal be transport in line with legal requirement aim at protect their welfare animal export for breeding be transport in very good condition so that they can live full and healthy life once they arrive in their destination country moreover the export of breed livestock from the uk can assist in food resilience of local breed in third country indeed british breed can offer advantage such as genetic disease resistance and high quality animal the bill do not apply to journey within the uk the channel islands and the isle of man nor do it apply to livestock and horse movement within the uk such as those from great britain to northern ireland that be to ensure that farmer in northern ireland have unfettere access to the uk and republic of ireland market this bill will not apply in northern ireland in addition to the central provision that introduce the ban the bill contain delegate power to provide regulation about enforcement of the ban it empower the appropriate national authority to make regulation to provide for enforcement and set out the scope of those enforcement regulation include safeguard relate to power of entry and the criminal offence that may be create the minister have identify point of great resentment to people in northern ireland who be concerned about animal welfare and it should be point of concern for people right across the uk he have indicate that the bill can not and will not apply to northern ireland the journey that he say be unnecessary stressful and exhausting and can cause injury to animal when they be transport from great britain will be able to occur for animal base in northern ireland they can be take to the south of spain without any of these requirement be apply to they how do he explain that it be because the bill ensure that farmer in northern ireland have unfettere access to the uk and the republic of ireland the point that the right hon gentleman highlight be part of the wide issue that the house have debate at length not least when consider the windsor framework we have discuss those issue on many occasion in this house the bill empower the appropriate national authority to make regulation to provide enforcement and include safeguard relate to power of entry and the criminal offence the power will enable the department to work closely with the scottish and welsh governments to provide an effective and proportionate suite of measure to enforce the ban across england scotland and wales it will ensure that the enforcement of the ban can work alongside the exist protection on the welfare of animal in transport which be set out in detail in exist legislation the bill also repeal section to of the animal health act those provision be intend to prevent the export of horse and pony for slaughter particularly by set minimum value requirement now that we be ban all live export include of horse and pony for slaughter those provision be no long necessary their repeal will streamline the legislation avoid any confusion that might arise from the existence of two measure for control the export of horse and pony for slaughter give the degree of support for the ban on live export want to reassure member from across the house that the ban and its associate enforcement regulation will come into force as soon as possible in conclusion continue to allow the unnecessary live export of animal for slaughter would undermine this country proud record on animal welfare be confident that many member of this house will agree on the importance of advocate for the animal in our care and that this bill mark another significant milestone in our progress towards deliver well animal welfare across the nation in the eu referendum bring renew public interest in finally end live export for slaughter now that we have this long await opportunity urge the house to support the bill in consign this unnecessary trade to the history book commend the bill to the house if you will allow mr deputy speaker would like to start by pay tribute to my right hon friend mark drakeford ms the first minister of wales mark announce that he be stand down from the senedd last week want to thank he for his friendship to and pay tribute to his service to the people of newport west and of wales over many year wish he very long happy healthy retirement where be the minister for animal welfare disgracefully he be sit in the other place have be appoint to the house of lords last week the sudden appointment of an unelected peer in the day before christmas do not inspire confidence that this government care about animal welfare the prime minister seem to have such little faith in his mps such lack of trust with his back benchers that he can not find single member sit on the benches opposite to be the animal welfare minister welcome the bill on behalf of labour members but it beggar belief that it have take so long to bring this unnecessarily cruel trade to an end with christmas in few day acknowledge that this be the season to be kind and festive on that basis and with tory ministers finally do the right thing labour will support the bill even if it be long overdue gently say to the secretary of state that labour call for legal ban on live export for slaughter and fatten from or through great britain in and have be encourage the government to act ever since the opposition have long call for ban on live export because million of farm animal risk face long distance journey every year when export for fattening and slaughter cause they unnecessary suffering as we have hear from the secretary of state those journey can cause animal to become mentally exhausted physically injure hungry dehydrate and stress that be why the bill and the change it will bring about be so important the bill prohibit the export of relevant livestock from great britain for slaughter and provide that person who commit an offence in england and wales under those clause in the bill be liable on summary conviction in england and wales to imprisonment for term not exceed the maximum term for summary offence to fine or to both the bill will make it an offence to send transport or organise transport or to attempt to send transport or organise transport for livestock for export from or through great britain for fatten and slaughter outside the british isles the ban in the bill apply to range of livestock include cattle horse sheep goat pig and wild boar but we note not poultry the bill be narrow in scope and reach and the majority of its provision will extend to england scotland and wales so the house will be interested in hear from the minister about what concrete discussion take place with the devolved administration the secretary of state have already mention research and consultation but what actual discussion be have with the administrations in devolve area be proud of the labour party track record on deliver progress on animal welfare in government we end the testing of cosmetic product on animal in and stop the cruelty of fur farming in in the last parliament labour mp and their leader do everything they possibly could to keep we in the single market if they have succeed we would never have be able to ban live export thank the right hon lady for her intervention but be not sure that it be relevant to what we be talk about today we introduce the hunting act and the landmark animal welfare act my hon friend be make an excellent speech particularly commend her point about foxhunt and the action take by the last labour government to tackle that appalling activity do she agree with that there be enormous interest in animal welfare both around provision set out in the bill and wide aspect of the issue do she agree that the government have spend very long time on this but they have not yet deliver comprehensive animal welfare bill despite previous attempt would she now like to see further action take on that and on many other matter my hon friend must have read my speech and that of my hon friend the member for cambridge daniel zeichner because we certainly want people to go far and fast as the secretary of state have already say it have take seven or eight year to get to this point although we be clear that the bill be only one step towards improve animal welfare the government have dither delay and let down livestock our pet and animal there have be and half year of inaction failure and disappointment the tories have take weak approach to animal welfare from pull bills to cave in to their back benchers there have be little commitment to follow through on their promise and pledge say to government members well to those who be here we will take no lesson from this conservative government that recently ditch plan to end puppy farming and trophy hunting among other example of let we down on animal welfare we can not forget the much miss animal welfare kept animals bill because that be where the bill come from back in may the conservative government throw out the animal welfare kept animals bill and instead decide to implement various measure separately which be why we be here today the tories track record on animal welfare have be nothing short of disaster they have show themselves to be party that can not be trust when it come to protect vulnerable animal just as they have prove themselves to be party that have no interest in help vulnerable people will the minister tell we where the ban on cage for farm animal be where be the animal welfare labelling or the action to ensure that farmer from newport west to newcastle under lyme from high peak to the highland be not undercut by low welfare import in particular where be the hunt trophies import prohibition bill my hon friend the member for croydon north steve reed say hunt endangered animal be barbaric and must be confine to history we must stop the selfish trophy hunter who want to slaughter then display endangered animal body part for their own perverse self gratification the conservative government must stop side with these killer if they refuse to act they will be complicit in the slaughter as they break yet another pre election promise do the secretary of state agree with that and if so what will he do about it if he do not agree why not there be even more where be the action to stop puppy smuggling where be the plan to stop pet theft when will we finally see ban on the importation of dog with cropped ear will we ever see ban on snare the welsh labour government have ban snare and thank to pressure from the labour party the scottish government be plan to do the same so why be westminster still dither and delay many of these promise be contain in the action plan for animal have the minister read the action plan if so why have he abandon so many of the promise contain in it make change through private member bills be not leadership if ministers really want tory back benchers to lead on animal welfare legislation the prime minister could make one of they animal welfare minister as back bencher who serve on the animal welfare kept animals bill committee the big problem be that lot of additional legislation be potentially be add to the bill would the opposition spokesperson like to comment on the labour party position on halal slaughter for example thank the hon gentleman for raise that issue look forward to that discussion in committee make change through private member bills be not leadership rather than tory back benchers lead on animal welfare legislation ministers need to get on with it pay tribute to all the stakeholder and campaigner who devote their time and attention to fight for the strong animal welfare provision we can deliver the opposition stand ready to facilitate speedy journey through the house for the bill but we will seek to make it as strong effective and durable as we can the hon lady be talk about the labour party promote animal health and welfare how do she square that with the welsh labour government policy on tuberculosis in cattle and the uk labour party say it will stop control of the wildlife reservoir for tuberculosis when it have be scientifically prove that that conservative government policy have be reduce the instance of tuberculosis in cattle in the united kingdom pay tribute to the hon gentleman for his interest knowledge and expertise in this area but the science be dispute we will continue to listen to all side of the scientific argument and look forward to discuss the issue in committee be grateful for advance warning of the committee of the whole house so staff who support the shadow defra team can do some planning over the festive period and enjoy well earn rest wish the bill well when the question be put today we will support it and look forward to see it sign into law the soon the well it be huge pleasure to speak in the debate we have be wait for this bill which be one of our manifesto commitment but we have not leave the european union back in so we have to wait until such time as we could take decision as soon as we could make commitment we make the decision to introduce the bill the way the opposition have try to present themselves on aspect of animal welfare have be somewhat suspect indeed early this year the minister for food farming and fisheries my right hon friend the member for sherwood mark spencer share the reason why the animal welfare kept animals bill could not be take forward be delighted to see my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth at the debate as well as other right hon and hon friend for the record in hansard there be not single labour back bencher on the opposition benches the one who be there the hon member for reading east matt rodda have just walk out of the chamber but meanwhile there be to member on the government benches while the labour party talk good game on animal welfare do my right hon friend agree that it be the conservatives who be significantly improve protection for animal and our much love pet totally agree with my hon friend however do think that we should be open about this animal welfare should not be matter for competition as some try to suggest we be nation of animal lover that be why there will be strong support for this bill we should not try to play each other off suggest that one side care more than the other of course conservation be very much in the dna of our conservative party and that be why be delighted to be support the bill today let try to take the partisan element out of this our great friend sir david amess who be conservative mp and patron of the excellent conservative animal welfare foundation be also very skilled at work across party to achieve objective and he be passionate about this cause do my right hon friend the former secretary of state for the department for environment food and rural affairs agree that it would be great tribute to he if all of we in all part of this house could pass this very important bill into law of course agree with my right hon friend indeed be stand in front of the shield of my former hon friend conscious reminder of the sacrifice that he pay for be member of this house he will be know forever for his passion for animal welfare and be delighted that as well as his close friend his successor my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth have continue that journey the bill be straightforward it do what it say on the tin that be the right approach wish that other part of the european union would agree to this be delighted that this legislation be one of the brexit bonus it will be the second piece of primary legislation that defra have introduce the first be the genetic technology precision breeding act know that there be more to do and know that there be plenty of speaker who wish to speak today but let we think carefully about how we can accelerate this bill so that it get through the next stage in one day believe that business have be table for the first week back so that we can make sure that this legislation come into effect as quickly as possible that be good for the welfare of animal and good for our reputation around the world it will show the leadership that we can bring and make sure that we continue to be strong in what we be do while still recognise the ongoing animal welfare reform that this conservative government have already put in place and know that there will be many more to come call the snp spokesperson this second reading debate on the animal welfare livestock exports bill be not simply another ordinary piece of parliamentary business this evening it mark profound moment it be one step of the many step still require to fortify our collective commitment to the welfare of all sentient being at the heart of the bill lie commitment to redefine our treatment of animal its primary objective be to prohibit the export of live cattle sheep goat pig and horse for slaughter or fatten from the united kingdom this be not merely matter of regulatory oversight in need of correction it be principled stand against the unnecessary stress exhaustion and injury inflict on sentient being during their exportation the bill be not about restriction it embody progress evolution and the establishment of more ethical standard in our treatment of animal its aim be to ensure that animal be slaughter in high welfare domestic slaughterhouse here in the united kingdom prevent their export to potentially low welfare condition elsewhere the uk government commitment to allocate funding to farmer to improve welfare condition be welcome as be the provision of the million fund for small abattoir that the minister outline underscore the comprehensive approach to the legislation it signify investment in the wellbeing of our livestock as well as an acknowledgement of the pivotal role that farmer play and will continue to play in our community and in society the journey through this milestone have not be without challenge as we know the animal welfare kept animals bill which be first propose in face internal turmoil within the tory party prevent its progression through this place and ultimately lead to the government scrap it altogether two year later four defra ministers and persistent advocacy from every quarter have prod and prompt the government to this point to address the press issue of animal welfare the snp have be fully commit to the banning of live export of animal for fatten and slaughter and we welcome the outlined aim of the bill our track record in scotland of implement and manage robust animal welfare standard align with our national ambition this legislation hold particular significance for scotland the scottish government have be at the forefront not only in consider animal welfare initiative but in protect our exquisite world beat scottish produce as well as stand up for those who produce it for we the propose change in the bill to livestock transportation time reflect nuanced understanding of the physiological and psychological impact of transport these being the maximum journey time for cattle sheep pig calf and broiler be design to reduce stress and discomfort during their transportation demonstrate commitment to their wellbeing collaborative effort between the scottish animal welfare commission and the uk animal welfare committee have seek not only to address share concern in this specific area but to extend their attention to various other issue of concern include avian influenza control the culling of male chick precision breeding responsible sourcing of fur livestock breeding and the welfare of pig and equine at slaughter this collaboration exemplify the potential for an open and collaborative approach to address broad animal welfare challenge that we will face in the future it be crucial to re emphasise that this legislation be not just about animal welfare it be about our identity as society and the value and compassion that we have for ethical treatment the call for ban on live export be not an isolated action but part of broad movement for change public support for ban be overwhelming as have be demonstrate by the many petition call on the uk government to take the keep animal bill through parliament it be crucial to be clear that the ban as propose will apply only to export for fattening and slaughter from or through the united kingdom it explicitly exclude the export of breeding animal recognise their vital role in scotland agricultural sector in addition any change in legislation must continue to be craft with keen understanding of scotland establish pattern of livestock movement from island and remote area any ban must not disadvantage scottish farmer or crofter by impede movement between the island and the mainland this will be key concern for we go forward the ban should not include animal export for breeding which be an integral part of scotland agricultural sector particularly in trade with the republic of ireland the scottish government welcome the uk government intention to introduce this bill and express willingness to work jointly with they and other devolve administration to ensure smooth implementation across the nation we in the scottish national party believe the legislation if enact will not only reflect our commitment to improve animal welfare but also safeguard our reputation as nation that champion the wellbeing of all live being collectively let we not squander this chance to make history to set standard for compassion and to ensure that our action align with the value that we hold dear as we continue to debate the intricacy of this legislation at its next stage let we remain steadfast in our resolve to protect our farming community and to build future where the welfare of animal be non negotiable priority declare personal and professional interest as veterinary surgeon very much welcome not only the introduction of this animal welfare legislation but importantly the cross party support for it across the united kingdom the bill will ban the export of cattle sheep goat pig and horse from great britain for slaughter or fattening that have huge benefit for animal welfare decrease both the stress on the animal that have travel long distance and the incidence of injury and disease that be associate with long travel this will fulfil conservative manifesto commitment and strongly welcome that as have be mention by member across the house it will also help to ensure that animal be slaughter domestically and close to home that be so important to improve animal welfare because if we reduce the distance that animal be transport that will be huge benefit to the animal it be so important that animal be rear slaughter and then eaten locally that be good for the environment good for animal welfare and good for local business importantly this bill stipulate that the meat can then be transport and export as well it be much well to transport on the hook rather than the hoof however we still need to work on improve transport condition for all animal farm livestock as well as horse urge everyone not to drop the ball on that just because this brilliant bill be come in it do not mean that we do not still have work to do to improve transport condition for animal welcome the comment of the secretary of state on the exemption for the movement of animal for breeding and other purpose potentially include sport however it would be helpful if that be make little clear in the bill and the explanatory note so that any doubt be remove as say it be important that animal be slaughter close to home the environment food and rural affairs committee have produce report on that topic such as move animal across border and many other one of our key recommendation be that we need to support the uk abattoir network and ensure that sufficient number of abattoir be spread around the country to reduce the distance to travel hugely welcome the government announcement last week of the million small abattoir fund which will go long way to help with that situation also welcome the bill stop the export of young unweaned calf for long journey for fattening and slaughter in addition to the bill we need to ensure that we adapt and use more of the animal farm here we need to reduce the production of dairy bull calf that be then lose to wastage we can do that with such thing as semen selection we should also encourage the rearing of dairy bull calf locally and the use of less popular cut and type of meat such as rise veal that will help animal welfare in the future too throughout the debate we need to be cognisant of food security which come into sharp focus with the pandemic and the war in ukraine food security be so important for our country and we need to be much more resilient in produce food we need to think about the workforce issue again declare an interest as veterinary surgeon an efra committee report recommend that we keep an eye on the number of vet we train and retain in the profession prior to our leave the european union to of veterinarian who work in the meat hygiene sector be from the eu we need to keep on our radar the need to staff our abattoir and food processing plant adequately last year we have crisis in the pig farming sector with pig dam back on farm because they could not be take to slaughter to be process we need to keep an eye on the workforce issue and think about the resilience of some of the infrastructure carbon dioxide be an indirect result of fertiliser production and be need for the slaughter of poultry and pig in the last couple of year cf fertilisers have shut its plant in ince and cease ammonia production at its billingham plant for food security and resilience government need to keep watching brief on that as my hon friend have mention pig twice another area where we would like the government to move hope with the support of all party be on ban the awful use of pig farrow crate be sure that be the government to introduce legislation for that purpose again the issue be close to sir david heart it too would enjoy great support in this house thank my right hon friend for that intervention on horse welcome the comment of the secretary of state and the bill provision but huge number be still be illegally export to europe under the guise of sport competition or breeding where they end up be slaughter on the efra committee we hear harrowing evidence from world horse welfare that the practice still go on welcome the bill try to stop that illegal practice but we need to do more work on that we need to improve the identification of horse and get central equine database the bill be welcome but we must not drop the ball on other issue prior to our leave the european union we have tripartite agreement whereby high performance elite and high health horse be able to move smoothly between ireland france and the united kingdom we need to try to get replacement scheme in place the movement of animal in and out of the country be important in animal health and welfare and for the united kingdom biosecurity welcome the government move forward with the border target operating model hopefully the station at the sevington campus in kent will be in place soon to help with that the secretary of state mention the great work of the animal and plant health agency put on record my thank to the staff of apha for maintain our biosecurity for animal health plant health and indirectly human health those staff do so much in keep the sector safe as have be mention avian influenza be still with we the farming minister be well aware of that have have correspondence with he about it the bluetongue episode in ruminant that we be see in both kent and norfolk show we that we must be diligent with our biosecurity african swine fever be rise up through the continent of europe we need to ensure that we be vigilant to stop that horrific disease come into the united kingdom heaven forbid that another disease like foot and mouth disease come into the country that show we how important apha be for our biosecurity and for the future of british business urge ministers to keep make the case to the treasury to refurbish the apha hq in weybridge surrey it be so important for our national security the bill also have many pragmatic measure it do not apply to movement within the united kingdom which will help and importantly northern irish farmer will still have access to the uk and irish market some of the practical measure in the windsor framework be develop in the bill but we need further clarity on the movement of animal between gb and northern ireland and vice versa know that colleague in the democratic unionist party feel strongly about the availability of veterinary medicine in northern ireland of veterinary medicine be go to be lose but suspension in december have extend availability for further three year to it be important that we work with our european friend and ally to get clarity on long term availability of veterinary medicine in northern ireland the conservative government have strong record on animal welfare agree that it should not be party political issue the government have pass the animal welfare sentience act create the animal sentience committee so that every piece of legislation must have due regard to animal sentience which be so important pass the sentencing act to increase the penalty for cruelty to animal and bring in the compulsory microchipping of cat just last week we talk about ban the keeping of primate as pet as we have hear individual bills such as today be be introduce as well as private member bills to tackle pet theft pet smuggling and puppy smuggling and to stop the import of dog that have have their ear horrifically crop of cat that have have their claw horrifically take off they and of heavily pregnant cat and dog those bills be be introduce as be another on livestock worry animal welfare unite we in humanity and across the house it be so important that we pass the bill welcome the cross party support and wish the bill well as it travel be happy to follow my constituency neighbour the hon member for penrith and the border dr hudson and to agree with many of the thing that he say my party and be very supportive of the bill to ban the live export of animal in particular cattle sheep goat pig horse and other equine beast be really positive step we hope there will be no opposition to the bill this evening but should it come to vote we will support its second reading if there be we will join the minister in the aye lobby we be disappointed and we be not alone in this by what be not in the bill because it be drop in the last session by the fact that the measure previously promise by this government be now either be drop altogether or put through the very unreliable route of private member bills and by the length of time it have take to get here but we can not avoid the fact that the ban on live export of animal be positive move towards ease unnecessary suffering of animal the journey that those animal have be force to make before be slaughter be often needlessly stressful and distressing and threat to animal welfare it be basic act of decency that today we begin the process of legislate accordingly however as have be mention by more than one contributor to the debate so far we sign trade deal not very long ago with at least one country that be not abide by this kind of legislation australia still permit live export of animal over long distance include overseas for the time being and in country much large and much hot than the one in which we be legislate to regulate if we be talk about the impact and influence that this country have on animal welfare why do we not use that sovereignty and that power to ensure that we be not just export the animal welfare problem while import produce to this country that deal threaten not just animal welfare globally but the wellbeing welfare and income of our own farmer who abide by animal welfare standard often high than those we legislate for in this country and legislate for previously through the eu and be beacon of strong animal welfare performance for they to be undermine by that trade deal be an outrageous assault on our farming community and threat to animal welfare hope the government will learn the lesson from that in any future trade deal the secretary of state who be no long in his place be right when he say that the uk have the good animal welfare standard in the world think that be accurate not only do it feel correct but think it be accurate be concern though that they be not just accidentally so one of the reason they be so be the nature of the farming we have in the united kingdom largely small family farm maybe large in geographical scope but small in term of the size of the business they be the basis of our farming economy across the united kingdom would say that get rid of the common agricultural policy and move to the environmental land management scheme be one of those rarely sight beast brexit benefit good thing if the government be handle the transition well but they be not we see that at least sixth of the money that the government promise to english farmer be not be spend and have not be spend in the last financial year not because the government have choose to cut that money but because they have just not manage to spend it farmer be lose vast amount of their basic payment and be gain very little in environmental payment to replace they talk to farmer on friday who reckon that he would make up about or of what he have lose in basic payment via the new scheme what do that do to farm across the country we lose farmer if we lose farmer we lose the ability to do good environmental work on our landscape we lose our ability to feed ourselves as country and we increase the chance of move to ranch style farming which tend to have less close animal husbandry and therefore culturally and necessarily low standard of animal welfare as we pass this legislation and hope we be go to start that ball roll tonight and that we will all agree to it let we ensure that we be not through our fiscal action undermine animal welfare throughout the country it be true that how we treat animal be sign of what we be as culture and whether we be decent or whether we be not it be absolutely right that we be do what we be do while the challenge out there still remain if we can minimise journey of animal from where they be rear to slaughter as my neighbour the hon member for penrith and the border rightly point out that be of great significance and importance to tackle animal welfare problem my fear be that the red tape and the collapse of the workforce in our abattoir not just the inability to bring in vet from overseas but the lack of other member of the slaughterhouse workforce mean that many small abattoir be under enormous threat four million pound will not even touch the side when it come to protect small abattoir in cumbria which be the good in the country they be family firm they aid animal welfare and they be massively important to our local economy this bill do many good thing but it do nothing to address series of other compassionate move that could have be deal with in one swoop as the government originally be plan to do the rspca which of course have campaign for this particular ban for year find that the dropping of the animal welfare kept animals bill last year and the omission in the king speech break grand total of pledge on animal welfare will just list handful of they the first pledge be on zoo licensing the original plan be for animal welfare standard in zoo to be enforce more thoroughly increase the penalty for zoo that miss those animal welfare standard that pledge be drop and there be no sensible reason for that the second be livestock worrying which be serious problem for our community in westmorland it be unbelievably distress to farmer their family and everybody else to see the goring of livestock by uncontrolled animal in the government original plan the police would have be give additional power to protect sheep and livestock from dog something that be not only an animal welfare issue but an economic one for the farmer there be no obvious reason why that would be drop the third pledge be ban on primate be hold as pet and drop that ban be ridiculous nonsense there be no reason why it should not have be in this bill or why the original animal welfare kept animals bill should not have proceed that have be omit it be bizarre that that be not all in the same legislation the fourth be puppy smuggling we know that as thing stand people can bring five animal per person in vehicle over the border legally we know that puppy farming be problem and the failure to tackle it through this bill just seem peculiar the lack of additional intervention and action to punish the theft and unlawful importation of such animal seem massive miss opportunity by the way the government could have adopt my presentation bill the pets theft and importation bill just few month ago if they have want to go down that route the bill be reheating of their own promise from the conservative manifesto just wonder why the minister do not just seek to adopt my bill and put it into practice would obviously have be very happy if they have steal every single word of it to conclude my remark also regret any sense that one party love animal more than any other understand that and be sure that the government front bench be fill with animal lover as much as every other part of this house nevertheless it be regrettable that that be not enough for maybe not the minister but government business manager to have acquire the backbone to take on their own back benchers when they threaten to be troublesome over more comprehensive version of this bill the one that be promise in the conservative manifesto and that have now not be deliver the omission from this bill be source of shame and anger for many of my constituent in westmorland but what remain in the bill be good so it would be foolish to oppose it and we will support its second reading think we should acknowledge at the outset mr deputy speaker the work that you do before you be in the chair on this issue and other animal protection scheme over many many year it be quite right that we have mention david amess but his neighbour for many year be sir teddy taylor work for sir teddy in the when we be desperately try to get the ban on transport livestock and we could not off the hoof and on the hook be also journalist for part of that time and the express group as it be now pay for and some of the express photographer because our lorry be be stop go to italy by french farmer the french be worried about what be happen to their livestock and their income very often when they open those lorry particularly as they get close to the italy france border lot of the animal be dead completely agree that farmer want to protect their livestock and look after their husbandry brilliantly but we could not say that about lot of the haulier say that as former haulage minister be really appal at the money grub way in which some haulier particularly those that come across empty from italy to take livestock back worry about how much diesel they be use and whether their tachograph be run properly the bill be brilliant teddy pass away few year ago but he will be watch down on we now absolutely thrilled about the bill agree with the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron that there be more that we would like absolutely can not understand for instance this have not yet be mention why we ban the production of foie gra in this country but allow its import be sorry because there be probably people in this chamber who completely disagree but it be barbaric how on earth can someone force feed an animal that be rightly ban in this country when we be in the european union yet we allow it to be import there be thing that we can do include on puppy smuggling my young daughter have just spend an awful lot of money on new puppy really hope that it do not destroy her new home in the way that many of the puppy that have have have do there be thing that we can do to be generous would turn around and say this categorically could not have be do while we remain in the european union there have be complaint that it be take too long but the time that have pass since we settle brexit be relatively short in agriculture and farming we have have to create whole new financial field thank goodness for campaigner who be now sadly long go from we david go too early you be still here with we mr deputy speaker but for those of we who be fight for this in the be absolutely chuffed to be here this afternoon call jim shannon thank you mr deputy speaker you just throw off there be expect to jump up and then sit back down again as always be very pleased to speak in the debate share the attitude of the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron we will not oppose the bill either but must put on record some concern declare an interest as member of the ulster farmers union and landowner in an early intervention refer to the importance of the land someone can always buy another house but they can not always buy the land land can never be replace it be important to understand that and know that the minister understand it as well as do his love of the land be similar to my own do not deal in livestock our neighbour use the land as part of his dairy farm some might think that we be all part of the cattle mart in this house think that would be rather harsh but some might see it that way hail from farming community and country background so see at first hand the need for animal to be keep in humane condition be thankful for the farmer in my area particularly my neighbour who take such good care of their animal to the bill provision will not be difficult obligation for our farming community to fulfil because they be already rightly do so in their care for their animal as have become the norm the minister probably know this be come but must put it on record northern ireland be be treat as third nation with different rule agree that there need to be sensible work relationship with our neighbour that our farmer need to be able to meet their market obligation while meet our animal right obligation and that we simply need well way of do thing but in letter to colleague the minister say to ensure that northern ireland farmer have unfettere access to the uk and irish market this bill will not apply in northern ireland my right hon friend the member for east antrim sammy wilson say as much during his intervention on the secretary of state and he will make that case much well than can when he have the opportunity to do so later that sound like generous pro union move to help northern ireland in the light of all the problem with the protocol and the windsor framework the hon member for penrith and the border dr hudson refer to the veterinary issue get regular report from across the chamber from across my constituency and from across all of northern ireland that vet can not get the veterinary medication they want there might be deal to say that we have long period in which to use medication but the fact be that we do not have that deal and vet in northern ireland be tell every week that they can not access the medication they need understand that the hon gentleman have deep interest in that matter but for the factual evidential case we need to put on the record where the problem really be if we look at the framing of clause it become immediately apparent that there be no need whatever for the bill not to apply to northern ireland because it do not prohibit the movement of live animal within the british isle the clause could be change so that the word great britain be replace with the united kingdom because the offence the clause would create be about movement beyond the british island in that context it immediately become apparent that there be one reason and one reason only that the bill apply only to part of the united kingdom because the government have and say this respectfully give into eu pressure to disrespect the territorial integrity of the united kingdom the eu be claim the right to make law in northern ireland include on animal movement we feel greatly aggrieve about where we be in relation to that love my britishness and my united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland but be second class citizen my people the people of strangford and elsewhere across northern ireland be also second class citizen that annoy greatly we be thus subject to the decision of legislator whom we do not elect and about whom we know nothing it seem to that rather than protect the union and animal welfare within it the bill sacrifice the integrity of the united kingdom democracy in northern ireland and animal welfare at the altar of the all important wish of the european union know that the minister and be of the same mind on brexit but the brexit that he have be very different from the brexit that have wish that have the same as he but that be not the case just yet if he could provide credible alternative explanation would be very glad to hear it again my concern be not about the bill which be necessary and welcome but about the exclusion of northern ireland so specifically in this scenario agree with the ulster farmers union about the need for the free flow of animal but be unconvinced that the bill need to exclude northern ireland await the minister response have speak about puppy farming in westminster hall and this chamber include in adjournment debate perhaps the minister will confirm his position we have criminal puppy smuggle gang bring dog across from the republic of ireland into northern ireland ultimately they be able to bring they across the water as well we need clarification on that know that the minister be always keen to respond and give we the encouragement that we need and tonight need encouragement that puppy farming and illegal puppy smuggling be do for good and that the gang who live off the back of those poor innocent animal be give very short shrift warmly welcome the bill as further evidence of the conservative commitment to improve standard of animal welfare in this country the presence of the bill on our agenda mean in my view that this be good day for parliament this have be long time come be talk not about the demise of the animal welfare kept animals bill but about the decade long concern about this issue it be at the end of the victorian era that the public first start to express their grave concern about the suffering of animal transport overseas for slaughter demand that this trade be bring to an end lead to committees be establish by ministers as far back as and an attempt to restrict export in by the major government be block by the european court of justice on the ground that it impede the operation of the eu single market the trade peak at over million animal year in the early and opposition to live export also grow in the as we have hear from my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning very large scale protest take place include what become know as the battle of brightlingsea in this see somewhat unlikely alliance between local essex resident and animal right protester band together to try to prevent the export of livestock through the town while thankfully export from the uk have stall over the past few year around the rest of the world about billion animal be still subject to excessive long distance transportation as we have hear many time in this chamber over the decade live export can involve animal cram into truck and on to ship for journey in shocking condition that can last several week during which they suffer distress from mishandle overcrowding excessive heat and cold motion stress injury prolonged hunger and thirst restriction of movement and an inability to rest of course the uk livestock send to europe should in theory be protect by the eu rule on live transport rule that certainly fight to toughen up when be an mep but as successive report from the european parliament confirm these rule simply be not always comply with or enforce so the suffering continue moreover there be danger that some animal export to european destination particularly hungary or bulgaria may be send on to the middle east suffer even long journey and slaughter condition that be frequently inhumane even the animal that stay in the eu can be subject to low welfare standard for example spain permit barren condition to be use for calf which would be illegal if deploy in this country and cruel and illegal practice in abattoir in france have be highlight on number of occasion include in report by the french parliament practical reason may have bring this trade from britain to halt for now but we must legislate to ensure that it do not start up again vital ethical principle be at the heart of this very long run debate the principle that as sentient being animal can not be treat simply as commodity the principle that civilised society must ensure that all animal particularly those use by human as part of our food supply and for other purpose be treat with compassion and spar unnecessary suffering and the principle that send livestock to other jurisdiction over which we have no control violate our moral responsibility to prevent unnecessary animal suffering today be an opportunity for we to listen to our constituent who tell we again and again that they want to end live export for slaughter and fatten once and for all pay tribute to every one of my constituent and other member of the public who over these past decade may have sign petition attend protest write to their mp or just play part in this long run campaign like other want to thank group such as compassion in world farming include the redoubtable peter stevenson the conservative animal welfare foundation the rspca world horse welfare and all those who have work so hard to get we to this point as well as figure such as selina scott and joanna lumley for their commitment and dedication to the cause over many year welcome this bill because it will deliver the ban for which have be campaign for quarter of century first as an mep and then as an mp commit the government to it when be the environment secretary and secure its inclusion in the conservative manifesto that be the first time that conservative promise on this issue extend beyond live export for slaughter to include fatten as well that be crucial change and it be crucial part of this bill the loss of the animal welfare kept animals bill be frustrating but now we have leave the eu and the single market this house finally have the power to determine what our law on this crucial question will be with that freedom now be the time to get this do to set an example to country around the world where these hellish long distance international journey still continue to ensure that animal produce in this country remain subject to our very high standard of animal welfare standard determine by this parliament and to implement the long hold wish of the constituent of each and every one of we mr deputy speaker as be sure you will agree now be the time to ban live export although very much welcome the return of this bill wish it have not be an afterthought wish this be not another turn albeit partial turn design to paper over the crack of year of government failure more than anything wish this government show the same concern for the welfare of those who care for our livestock farmer and farm be face huge deficit in their finance the department for environment food and rural affairs have cut cut cut funding to our farm this government have fail to create system that be equitable as the reform system still disproportionately benefit large landowner the take up of the flagship environmental land management policy the sustainable farming initiative be very low only eligible farmer be currently sign up all the while defra figure show cut in departmental communication at time when farmer be the least financially secure in year farmer be be send like lamb to the slaughter by this government and have be betray and undermine by the botched tory brexit deal and the shambolic lack of planning that have devastate farm finance leave many farmer on the brink farmer have be let down by trade deal with country that have far low animal welfare standard than our own flood the market with cheap and less quality produce and market continue to narrow far must declare an interest at this point may be merely spring lamb in this place but be from farming family my neighbour be farmer and my friend be farmer we be the custodian of the countryside and we care about the welfare of our livestock so be keen to shed light on how this government policy or lack of it affect farmer national farmers union polling datum from august show that of dairy farmer in england be seriously worried about the effect of government regulation on their finance farmer make up of the uk population but they account for of workplace incident rate time high than the uk industry average unfortunately last year of those be suicide do the hon member want to give we single example of regulation this government have introduce on dairy farmer will not at this stage will carry on with what be say but of course lot of funding have be cut in the royal agricultural benevolent institution big farming survey find that over third of respondent display symptom classify they as have poor mental health as flagging concern while display anxiety and show sign of depression the farmer at the high risk of poor mental health be those work with pig graze livestock and dairy the sector primarily affect by this legislation the liberal democrats be the first to assert that mental health be equal to physical health be very grateful to the farm safety foundation for its work and hope members will join in support its mind your head campaign in february urge any farmer listen today to use its fantastic little book to get information and help however we need the government to step up and stop expect charity to fill their wellie urge ministers to listen to our farmer reflect on government message and devise properly consider fully finance long term plan for food and farming resilience in this country call on the government to listen to our farmer and to the liberals democrats and to plan for the long haul and value the welfare of our hard work farmer as much as the welfare of our livestock it give great pleasure to speak in support of this wonderful bill its second reading be hugely welcome and not before time be assure by the word of my right hon friend the secretary of state and his statement on the government continue dedication to animal welfare have appreciate the opportunity to speak with front bench colleague about the importance of the bill and to share the view of my constituent directly with ministers on behalf of resident have have the opportunity to engage directly with various animal welfare organisation such as the dogs trust the rspca and cats protection the bill support the continue focus on animal welfare which be important to my constituent recently visit oak wood school in hillingdon which be host christmas fair for student with special educational need that involve interaction with animal such interaction not only support education but significantly enhance the wellbeing and confidence of young people the people of uxbridge and south ruislip be huge animal lover no one could go far in my constituency without spot many dog walker enjoy the wonderous open and green space that be part of one of london green constituency my inbox be often full not just with campaign email but with genuine heartfelt message that touch on all element of animal welfare that have be especially the case over the past couple of week as resident have echo my feeling in support of the bill indeed more than of the respondent to the department consultation on live export agree with the measure in the bill the bill seize on the opportunity post brexit to put an end to journey that have be describe as incredibly arduous stressful and exhausting for livestock no more will unweaned calf face cross channel journey that could last more than hour or sheep be transport for day on end that be especially important when we consider that livestock could end up be export to country with far low standard of animal welfare accord to defra figure there have be no recorded live export from the uk since the government announce their intention to introduce the ban it be therefore imperative that we pass the bill in order to consolidate those figure and make they permanent while make prohibit or under the radar transport illegal the bill continue to build on this country proud tradition as one of not just animal lover but upholder of animal welfare as evidence by the uk status as the highest rank nation in the animal protection index it be good to see new statutory welfare code for pig lay hen and chicken the ban on conventional battery cage for lay hen and the mandatory introduction of slaughterhouse cctv there be tough penalty for offence relate to animal cruelty measure to strengthen the law on animal sentience compulsory cat microchipping and many other measure care deeply about such issue as do resident across uxbridge and south ruislip be glad to support the bill this evening and look forward hopefully to join many colleague across the house in do so can not speak in this debate without start by talk about my amazing predecessor who campaign tirelessly on animal welfare during his year in this house as know you too have campaign mr deputy speaker sir david be the champion of all creature great and small many of which he protect in the confine of his own parliamentary room at its height it be home to five bird cage seven fish tank and even tank that house two turtle on their own in addition to regularly housing vivienne his daughter french bulldog can not speak about animal welfare in this house without refer to sir david he raise the issue six time during this parliament before he be murder his last contribution in the house just week before his murder be to ask for debate on animal welfare promise the resident of southend and leigh on sea that would do everything in my power to build on his legacy so be delighted to have the opportunity to speak today we be undoubtedly nation of animal lover that be why in we promise the british people that we would ban the live export of cattle and tonight we be make good on that promise it be shocking that live animal have long be export to the eu from the uk for breeding fattening and slaughter in most recent year in which live export have occur we be export between and sheep and calf for fattening and slaughter it be good that the last instance of the export of live animal be in december but that do not negate the necessity of our pass the bill this bill be point of principle and it underpin our commitment to high animal welfare standard some of those who take part in the government consultation on live export in think that livestock and horse should not be export for slaughter and fattening that view be echo by my constituent in southend and leigh on sea nearly of whom have write to urge to vote to ban live export do what our constituent and the general public specifically send we to this place to do be never bad place to start with any bill it be not surprising that the public take such view we all as child see image on our tv screen of animal in crowded crate and lorry and it would take the most callous person not to recognise the stress injury and exhaustion that those animal be subject to we have hear about unweaned calf from great britain travel to spain on journey last an average of hour that be two day two night and another whole day in crowded hot crate with not enough food and in absolutely disgusting condition in the short journey direct to slaughter from great britain to continental europe be hour that be an affront to every decent human being it be high time that we pass this ban and be proud that we be do so my hon friend the member for penrith and the border dr hudson make the point that if we ensure that animal be transport domestically for slaughter we can ensure that the condition in which they be slaughter be humane if they be export off to the continent we have no idea what pain and suffering they go through when they be slaughter and we have hear evidence of very much low welfare condition wholeheartedly support make it an offence to send transport or arrange transport for the export of live livestock such as cattle sheep goat and wild boar for fatten and slaughter also welcome the necessary exemption for breeding and competition horserace make unique contribution to the uk sporting culture and in particular to the rural economy be pleased that the bill will enable racehorse to continue to travel for racing and breeding provide that they be transport in line with legal requirement aim at protect their welfare we must remain ever vigilant in make sure that happen it be also important as other have say this be absolutely something that sir david would have say that we remember that we can bring in these measure only because we be no long member of the european union for year despite multiple campaign by animal welfare charity we be unable to ban live export because we be an eu member state bind by the eu rule which the european court of justice have rule be lawful the trade in the live export of animal be hold to be lawful as long as welfare in transport be comply with this bill be real brexit benefit it may have be long time come but that do not negate the fact that it be real benefit brexit give we the freedom to go beyond our european counterpart and underpin our credential as world leader in animal welfare be proud to be part of government who be pass such bill be proud that this conservative government have introduce world lead protection in any number of area and use this opportunity to encourage member from all part of the house to support my pet abduction bill on its second reading on january also call on defra be sure the minister know what be go to say to look again at emilie law and criminalise dog on dog attack in england which be such scourge for so many responsible pet owner who lose their beloved four legged companion unnecessarily due to the irresponsibility of another pet owner be delighted to support this bill today ban live export be the right thing to do the export of live animal have be stain on our society for far too long be glad that it be be stop but be even more glad that if we pass this bill tonight it will never come back again be not go to congratulate the minister on bring forward this bill first because we should ask why have it take so long the conservatives have this issue in their manifesto in they boast in the general election that they would use brexit freedom to bring in animal welfare measure and now at the end of we be finally see bill emerge there be no doubt about the need for this protection member have outline the undue and unnecessary suffering involve in the live export of animal and ministers have make reference to it whether it be the stress injury and trauma for animal the fact that they be take to destination where they be often treat far bad than they would be in abattoir here in the united kingdom the starvation or the fact that many animal die during those journey of course this be necessary piece of legislation if the government have grasp the brexit opportunity we could have introduce this bill long time ago it be no excuse to say we have not have any live export of animal anyway so it do not matter the fact be that there be promise and an ability to deliver on it but it be not do member have mention many of the other animal welfare measure that could have be introduce on leave the european union but they have not happen that be the first reason why will not congratulate the minister the bill be tardy and it be mark of the government unwillingness to use the opportunity that brexit make available to the country the second important reason why will not congratulate the minister be that the bill do not refer to the whole of the united kingdom northern ireland be leave out when intervene the secretary of state give the totally spurious reason that northern ireland be leave out to give northern ireland farmer because we can have movement within the british isles the benefit of be able to trade with the rest of the united kingdom and with the irish republic the farming minister may well argue that trade with the irish republic may not involve long journey for animal because some of the abattoir be just over the border and there be significant trade across the border and that be true however if it be only case of apply this bill to northern ireland so that we can trade with the irish republic it would have be easy to provide for that by have this bill cover the whole united kingdom with clause make it clear that when animal be be export to the irish republic final destination must be state because of the nature of trade across the border if the real aim of this bill as the secretary of state have say be to stop the disgraceful trade in animal be take for long journey in terrible condition with terrible suffering it have not achieve that for the thousand of animal who will still be able to be transport from northern ireland into the continent of europe suspect the house would thank neither nor the right hon gentleman if we try to embark on long debate about the windsor framework tonight be sure that the minister would not either do the right hon gentleman agree in principle that it would be desirable outcome if the government could find some mechanism in committee if they could be ingenious about it so that the benefit of this bill apply to animal in northern ireland if the government do that would eat the word with which start my speech and would congratulate the minister have suggest that it could be do by make the bill cover the whole of the united kingdom if the only concern be about the volume of cross border trade on the island of ireland the government should state in the bill that the livestock must have an end destination in ireland let just spell out the bill implication thousand of animal be export to continental europe every year the good thing be that we will now pontius pilate like be able to wash our hand and say if they be go to continental europe they will not go through great britain the bill make it clear that person who export relevant livestock from great britain or transport or attempt to transport relevant livestock from or through great britain or organise or attempt to organise the transport of relevant livestock from or through great britain will be break the law however there be nothing to stop someone from northern ireland take the animal in lorry the whole length of the island of ireland down to rosslare for hour sea journey they could then go on to continental europe and down to spain or wherever the final destination happen to be and all the suffering that this bill be attempt to stop would not be prevent for export from northern ireland people may say there be safeguard on the journey when the northern ireland assembly be operative remember raise the case of unweaned calf with an agriculture minister ask he to refuse to accept journey log unless the calf be give milk replacer and unload before the lorry go on ferry that be ferry journey do not forget of nearly hour will share the answer from the minister just so that can spell out the welfare implication of omit northern ireland from this bill he say that the department do not consider it necessary to feed calf during their rest period or before they get on the boat even if people do not do that they will be in compliance with eu regulation that be the implication of leave northern ireland out of this bill the real reason for do so be not to ensure that farmer in northern ireland can have free access to the irish republic the real reason be give early by another speaker judgment have be make in the european court of justice judgment make in the past still apply in northern ireland any judgment in the future will still apply in northern ireland eu law will and do still apply in northern ireland this bill can not apply in northern ireland because as result of the protocol the windsor framework and the arrangement that have be put in place northern ireland be still grip by the tentacle of the european union that be the real reason for leave northern ireland out of the bill do not let the minister pretend tonight that he be concerned about farmer in northern ireland not be able to take their cattle to abattoir or place for fatten in the irish republic if that be the case he could make that possible under this bill ask the minister whether that have be consider in his discussion if it have be consider and reject why have it be reject be he content that part of the united kingdom will still have the ability to export sheep cattle and animal of all sort right across the continent of europe and over long sea journey the sea journey will be long now because we can not use the land bridge of great britain the sea journey will be from rosslare to somewhere in northern france to that do not look like concern for the welfare of the animal that will be transport although it be not the subject of today debate one of the impediment to get an executive set up in northern ireland be that kind of intrusion even if the executive be operate today believe that the majority of mla in stormont want the same provision as there be for the rest of the united kingdom they would not be able to bring in those provision because this be an area where it appear that westminster do not have any control over the law in northern ireland the assembly would not have control over the law in northern ireland brussels make the decision on this the european court of justice have make ruling on it and the sufferer be the animal that be subject to inadequate protection in law the first thing want to do be thank my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth she pay lovely tribute to her predecessor who would be very proud of the remark she make be here today not only on behalf of the numerous constituent across north norfolk who have email about live export but because this be matter that be passionate about personally have speak on animal welfare matter in this place time and again and have post on my social medium many time about the importance of respect care for and look after animal of all shape and size right down to the tiny as member will know be the uk glow worm champion which always get slight chuckle here of course the house will remember my record break dark sky debate on the glow worm that inhabit sheringham park in my constituency which lead back in october on serious matter however we must put animal welfare at the forefront of all sphere of our decision making and be really proud that this conservative government be do that time and again as the minister will know livestock farming particularly pig and cattle be crucial part of my north norfolk agricultural market have be to see he enough time about it over the year locally we ensure that animal welfare be maintain norfolk produce of england livestock output total just under million with that economic backdrop in mind be firm believer that this bill when enact will bring substantial advantage to local farmer in north norfolk as well as to our agricultural heartland as we have hear from member of different party this evening it will not only bring economic advantage it will also enhance our local farmer capability to produce high quality local food in north norfolk we go to extraordinary length to look after animal welfare last summer visit the paterson farm in worstead in the wild of north norfolk and see the wagyu herd do not even know what wagyu be at the time it be delicious it be there be relax zen spa music play in the calving shed say be that for the farmhand no it be not it be to keep the calf and the birth herd calm so that they be relaxed and in turn all those animal be look after of course the meat be less stressed as well that be take animal welfare to the absolute limit do not suggest that every farmer implement public address system in their calving shed but it show the level of care that my farmer take over the welfare of their herd this bill be support not just by my constituent but by industry representative across norfolk and the uk more widely do not think that anyone have mention that the national farmers union support it as well as do the rspca although it be great that we will no long see the fattening and slaughter of animal transport overseas which will be outlaw it be great that we have not see that since it be also important that we get on and pass this legislation swiftly through parliament and put it permanently into practice will have particular pride when resident come up to and say name benefit of brexit because can now turn round and say there be yet another one this legislation be only possible because we have be able to take back control and sovereignty of our lawmaking by do away with decision making be bind by the european union animal transport law we have be able to introduce this bill no animal should be rear for slaughter and have to suffer in this way we have change track and we have be able to do that by leave the european union we will now continue our world lead status on animal welfare call the shadow minister it be pleasure to respond to tonight debate not least because we be grace with no few than four former and current defra secretaries of state on the government benches this evening find myself look for collective noun to describe they swarm as in bee shiver as in shark or crash as in rhinos there be endless possibility may offer festive greeting to those on the government front bench be afraid that be go to be the end of my kindness for tonight because what be inescapable be that the bill be massively diminish in ambition just like this government say to the right hon member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning who speak with real passion conviction and knowledge agree with much of what he say that the issue for the opposition be that this could all have be do more than two and half year ago those of we who sit on the bill committee for the animal welfare kept animals bill as do will recollect the day and day of interview witness take up their time and expertise and raise their hope and the hope of million across the country that action would be immediately forthcoming day be spend in committee yes the opposition table amendment and make suggestion that be our job but there be also strong support from the opposition for what the government say they be try to do because that committee be try to address the very real problem of the day the suffering of cage primate the worry by dog of farm animal puppy smuggling cruel mutilation such as ear and tail cropping and the pain of pet theft all that and more have be happen every day since for almost day the government have allow those abuse to continue perhaps the minister will explain why we have have to wait so long my hon friend make good point about measure in the keep animal bill several other measure include the foie gras ban be in scope of this bill but the government have choose to use private member bill to try to further that agenda be that not hugely flawed approach be grateful to my hon friend who hit the nail on the head the government be so timorous and afraid of further you should be actually they be so afraid that they have have to resort to this piecemeal approach frankly it complete abrogation of responsibility and what profound disappointment to those voter who in read the conservative manifesto and think that the conservatives care about animal welfare and would do these thing what let down this par down slither of bill be welcome only in that there be finally belatedly some action on this one issue as my hon friend the member for newport west ruth jones say in her opening remark we welcome it we will not oppose it and we will try to improve it in committee the shadow minister mention the conservative party general election manifesto my predecessor neil parish seek to amend the agriculture bill to prevent the ratification of any trade agreement that do not guarantee that the same animal welfare standard would be apply to import food do the shadow minister agree that standard for uk production be only half the picture unless we demand those same animal welfare standard be apply to import absolutely of course labour front bench members make that point repeatedly as do the hon member predecessor and other on the government benches include of course former secretaries of state who find themselves no long in their post and now free to speak their mind these issue matter because the british public really care about the health and welfare of animal we have see this in many poll but recent one have indicate that more than two third of respondent believe that we should do more to improve animal welfare and protect animal from cruelty we really be nation of animal lover as many have say and significant majority think that the government have clear responsibility to protect innocent and vulnerable animal from unnecessary suffering it be indeed one of the main role of the state to protect the most vulnerable in our society and that must include animal the government track record on animal welfare which do indeed once look promising be now in tatter but we be relieve that at least some progress be be make in the form of this ban on live export as my colleague state at the outset of the debate we will support the bill and look forward to its be sign into law at very long last may first draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests thank member from across the house for their constructive approach and for their comment and support for the bill it have be brilliant to hear that consensus although there be few area on which we may disagree it be clear that we can agree on the core aim of the bill that deep value that we all place on animal welfare act as our lodestar and be grateful for that share perspective the bill build on our proud record as world leader on animal welfare end the unnecessary export of livestock include horse will prevent the associated stress exhaustion and injury cause by those journey it will signal to our international partner our firm commitment to improve welfare standard for keep animal and reinforce our position as global leader on this important issue many animal welfare group have call for this ban on live export we have hear support for the bill from government members may put on record my acknowledgement of the kale kent against live exports group which have do an enormous amount of campaigning on the issue work with my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay who can not be in his place today and other colleague across the house we know that there be huge public support for the ban as evidence by the flood of respondent to our consultation of whom agree on the need for the ban on export for slaughter and fattening there be clearly broad recognition that we must end these unnecessary journey and we be take the opportunity to do that may pay tribute to number government member my hon friend the member for penrith and the border dr hudson who have vast experience in this area give an excellent speech and have focus great deal of effort on make sure that horse be not affect by their export he also refer to bluetongue and african swine fever assure he that we be very much on the case of make sure that our border be secure this week will talk to the chief veterinary officer about bluetongue and our response for next spring also pay tribute to all four former secretaries of state and it have not go unnoticed that we have have four time as many former secretaries of state on the government benches as there be labour back benchers in their place pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey who be good friend of mine and drive the bill forward during her time will get myself into trouble but also draw attention to my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers who start the process she have be an amazing campaigner and have fantastic track record on animal welfare it have not go unnoticed that my hon friend the member for uxbridge and south ruislip steve tuckwell be passionate campaigner on animal welfare just as his predecessor be can not stand at the dispatch box without pay tribute to the former member for uxbridge and south ruislip who be passionate campaigner on animal welfare issue that leave to the end my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth who have pick up the baton from her predecessor know that we be to get lecture on emilie law as she be campaigner who want to stop dog on dog attack pay tribute to she for all her effort on animal welfare be amuse by my hon friend the member for north norfolk duncan baker who tell we about cow be play music and radio station hope that they will not be play radio and farming today on regular basis that could be quite depressing for those animal assure the house that it certainly do not cheer up every morning we have have mostly positive debate there be few little chip from opposition members but will not dwell on they too much party politic should not really play role in animal welfare we in this house all care about animal because we be member of the united kingdom and we be british care about animal be within our dna the government will continue to push hard on animal welfare as the minister know have always have lot of time for he so shall not press he on the windsor framework but think that the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson have point our great friend sir david would have warmly welcome the bill but he have long shopping list so at the risk of press on the minister generosity will he agree to meet david excellent successor my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth and early in the new year to talk about the farm animal welfare committee report on farrow crate so that we can at least have discussion on the issue and see whether anything at all can be do be always delighted to meet my hon friend should my diary allow be sure we can find slot for that to happen pay tribute to all colleague who have participate today rise think have get away with it but will give way thank the minister hope that he be not come to conclusion but be about to address the very important point that raise in the debate the bill should include animal welfare provision right across the united kingdom there be route by which his concern about cross border trade between northern ireland and the irish republic would be deal with while at the same time ensure no loophole for long journey for animal into continental europe will he take that up in committee commit to continue this conversation with the right hon gentleman beyond the chamber should be clear that livestock transport for slaughter from great britain to northern ireland must go directly to slaughterhouse it would be an offence for they to move anywhere else on arrival at the slaughterhouse the animal and the accompany health certificate must be present to the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs officer at that point livestock export for any other purpose not for slaughter would need to remain at the place of destination in northern ireland for minimum of day and be re tagged that be necessary to comply with the animal identification requirement after arrive in northern ireland the requirement would mean that livestock must remain in northern ireland for minimum of day and would make the slaughter trade uneconomic in those circumstance be more than happy to continue the conversation with he offline we have give some thought to this and have have conversation with our friend both in the ulster farmers union and northern ireland rise will take one more intervention and then will conclude the minister be very kind one thing he probably do not hear mention be foie gra he have not mention the fact that make speech because it be not that good will he commit the secretary of state to meet my office be only two door down the corridor from he to discuss why we be allow foie gra to be import into this country when we ban its production here make that point in my speech but clearly do not get it across hard enough the danger of mention colleague by constituency be that occasionally miss one out apologise to my right hon friend for not single he out for his brilliance which be matter of record in this house get into trouble for make commitment at the dispatch box for my own diary so be not about to start make they for the secretary of state diary be sure that if my right hon friend be to write to the secretary of state he would be able to answer that question once again pay tribute to colleague who have participate in the debate commend the bill to the house question put and agree to bill accordingly read second time animal welfare livestock export bill programme motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the follow provision shall apply to the animal welfare livestock exports bill committal the bill shall be commit to committee of the whole house

simon clarke be discharge from the committee of public accounts and gary sambrook be add work and pensions that steve mccabe be discharge from the work and pensions committee and marsha de cordova be marcus jones on behalf of the committee of selection highways maintenance and integrated transport funding motion make and question propose that this house do now wood the good news be that to everyone relief include yours madam deputy speaker do not intend to use the full time technically available to to filibuster on this important matter although do hope to make an important contribution pothole drive we potty in the potteries which be why one of my top priority be to fix our break road and pavement the great city of stoke on trent have suffer from decade of under investment in our road previous labour run administration fail to invest into our road network it be not until when councillor abi brown the former leader of stoke on trent city council and her deputy councillor daniel jellyman make the right decision to invest record million to resurface more than road and pavement and fix more than pothole this be help by be the first local authority to have the staffordshire technological advancement the jcb pothole pro which fix pothole twice as fast and at half the cost of other machinery it be excellent that we now have one of those revolutionary machine for staffordshire county council which will serve the people of kidsgrove whitehill talke butt lane newchapel mow cop and harriseahead the prime minister recent network north announcement unlock transformational funding for our road infrastructure demonstrate that it be priority for this government more than billion have be set aside for council to bring road and pavement up to scratch the local government association argue that this will significantly improve council ability to improve our road infrastructure despite that investment the funding that come to we via the national highways funding formula be simply not good enough and it put pressure on local authority with the second poor council tax base in the country to take money from other service in order to ensure that our road be fit for purpose give the pressure on local authority budget it be essential that small city such as stoke on trent be not put at disadvantage comprise of six town stoke on trent be geographically unique realistically my constituent need to drive or take the bus from burslem tunstall smallthorne or kidsgrove to name few if they to go out and about shopping visit love one attend gp appointment or simply enjoy pint down the pub people in stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke rely on their car more than people elsewhere because we do not have tram network like in manchester or an underground network like in london that be why it be essential that our city have reliable road network to well connect our community commend the hon gentleman on bring forward this issue we all know that he be an assiduous and eager mp for his constituency do he agree that the scope of the formula ensure that rural town and village provide transport route to all major town will be fight for the table scrap recognition need to be give to the road in small town and rural area on the way to the big city when they be closed that mean no delivery and no commute the formula should treat the feed area as priority as well be grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention which be rite of passage in adjournment debate on rural community the minister helpfully remind believe do know that lambast on behalf of stoke on trent will probably not go down as well with my staffordshire base county council which benefit from the funding formula later will explain why the formula could be look at or there should be top up element for small regional local authority such as stoke on trent they need investment while hopefully not unfairly disadvantage rural constituency such as the one the hon gentleman represent with great dignity and pride ultimately it be as important that their road be resurface and repair as it be for the place of stoke on trent appreciate that be walk tightrope with the very people serve but hopefully will fall on the right side of it if fall at all out and about in stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke and when deal with casework in the office the state of road and pavement come up frequently that be evidence by my regular pothole patrol where my team and go out at least twice week across the constituency look for road and pavement that need repair report back to the local authority let use this opportunity to put on record my thank to nathan conna jess and mya who all work in my office in tunstall for go out in all weather to assist and the community by report pothole to our local authority one of the reason for stoke on trent break road and pavement be the unfair road funding formula the formula put busy city like stoke on trent at disadvantage and have be campaign to change they since the current highway funding formula use by the department for transport be calculate on road length rather than road usage therefore busy road in the centre of city will get less funding than long wind road in the countryside that be use less intensively and with few vehicle type such as heavy good vehicle research conduct by the department for transport in suggest that road under local authority control make up only of road length across the country but that that carry of the nation traffic minor road make up of road length but the proportion of traffic they carry be only slightly great than that on road the remain of traffic be carry on the of road that be motorway or trunk road clearly the current road funding formula be put small city like stoke on trent at disadvantage want to see new consideration introduce to the formula that would top up city like stoke on trent which lack the mileage of minor road but show due regard for road type with principal road attract premium in some way relate to their report condition the high concentration of warehouse in stoke on trent mean that our road be use by heavy good vehicle more regularly again that put the city at disadvantage because big vehicle carry heavy load do more damage to road surface there would need to be safeguard against false reporting of road condition and it would be useful to include match fund element for city such as stoke on trent that put precious resource into road despite have low council tax base it be not something we like to brag about in stoke on trent but there be an old folk tale that the word pothole originate in our fine city after josiah wedgwood decide to dig up all the clay available in the road to make his fine pottery and to put the pottery that be not up to scratch back into the road to make sure we have surface it be not something we like to brag about but it be certainly something we want to deal with to ensure we have pothole free community when start see constituent float duck or plant flower in their road once or twice have even think about bit of pitch and putt in some of the street because of their poor condition it be vital that they feel they be get their rightful investment westminster city council spend around million year on road maintenance thank to its parking revenue that be in stark contrast with stoke on trent which spend on average between and or around of westminster figure it be extremely difficult for stoke on trent to match westminster parking revenue which mean more support need to be direct to area that struggle to generate as much revenue as the like of westminster for example have be campaign to resurface gloucester road and newchapel road in kidsgrove key arterial road link the parish together four school day nursery maple tree court care home and the pump track at newchapel rec which secure from the kidsgrove town deal funding be all locate off this road so it be critical that it be safe for both pedestrian and motorist over local resident today have back my petition to staffordshire county council and hope the minister will use this opportunity to add his weight to my campaign also hope that in try to get the funding formula change the campaign will be roar success with motorist in the constituency just like the victory we secure when over resident back my petition to call on stoke on trent city council to rule out sadiq khan disastrous marxist ultra low emission zone policy from come to our great city commend stoke on trent labour for its bravery in stand up against its national party policy when labour deputy leader the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner inform she ahead of the debate say she want to see ulez in town and city across the whole of the uk cabinet member councillor wazir remain silent for over day before finally come out against ulez love national labour to rule out these anti motorist policy it be relief to resident across stoke on trent and wide north staffordshire who will be able to use our improved road without face farcical attempt to punish they for get from to the government network north announcement present new deal for the north and the midland help the region to compete with london and the south east along with the improvement to our bus and rail network such as the reopening of the stoke to leek line close since the beeching cut of follow my petition which receive the backing of over local resident and campaign alongside my north staffordshire colleague stoke on trent and staffordshire road network will also benefit significantly as say early over billion have be set aside for council to bring road and pavement up to scratch money from that billion will be use to upgrade junction of the main access route to the potteries from the south which will reduce delay come off the motorway we be also go to see upgrade to the corridor from stoke to derby which could save driver over minute every weekday these enhancement could create over new job and generate million for the west midland economy follow report call levelling up stoke staffordshire derby derbyshire the road to success series of recommendation be put forward for long await upgrade badly need to alleviate bottleneck along the km long corridor which link derby nottingham and leicester to stoke on trent staffordshire and the north west the road be one of the uk key artery and large manufacturer such as jcb rolls royce and toyota rely on this key east west route to keep supply chain move and provide link to international market currently traffic congestion on the threaten to stand in the way of business growth the route see between and vehicle pass along it every single day and need urgent support the project have the backing of mps local authority and business and be key to unlock growth in the west midland where city such as stoke on trent will benefit significantly if those business flourish be pleased that the money from network north be be set aside to help deliver this key route finally while have the minister here want quickly to mention another beneficiary of the prime minister network north announcement kidsgrove railway station have spend month negotiate who be responsible for remediation work to mitigate the risk from former mining activity at the site be dismay that network rail have still yet to take full responsibility plan include new car park to increase capacity and drive more footfall into kidsgrove town centre which will supplement the landmark town deal funding that be in addition to other upgrade at the station include new shelter on the platform and café there be also the share service hub which be another significant beneficiary of the town deal be call for lord hendy chairman of network rail to hold james dean the west coast main line route service director to account for repeat failure to act in the interest of the people he be suppose to serve be incredibly proud of the work we have do as local community to secure investment in stoke on trent and staffordshire since but there be more to be do both in stoke on trent and nationally the override mission of level up be to allow place such as stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke which have not see the benefit of an economic consensus drive by whitehall to compete with other part of the uk the road funding formula be symbolic of that and change it would be of huge benefit to our city it be litmus test for the government levelling up agenda congratulate my hon friend the member for stoke on trent north jonathan gullis on secure the debate and on enlighten the house so much as he always do about his amazing community know it well as visit it frequently he be genuinely transformational in his representation of it it be rare in an adjournment debate to be enlighten by the word and action of josiah wedgwood the origin of the word pothole limerick or lyric to describe how they drive the community potty in the potteries and so much more reference be make to the amazing tunstall team as shall now call they who have transform action in the local community pay credit to all the team who be do great work in bring forward action on the local road this be an important topic and there should be no doubt whatsoever that we in government take it very seriously my hon friend rightly raise the condition of local road which up and down the country be matter of great importance for motorist and local community one area where pothole be at the forefront of people mind be devon where we have an mile road network as long as iceland and twice the length of rwanda in rural area such as devon the road be also affect by for instance agricultural vehicle which place great strain on they than be place on urban road believe that the community that represent in rural northumberland be the second big in the country it take the good part of two hour to drive across it be extremely familiar with the impact of the farming community and be well aware of the consequence of forestry lorry in my own patch in hexham however would say gently to the hon gentleman that the government recently give uplift to devon county council it also give an uplift to stoke on trent city council which will discuss shortly in rather more detail while the hon gentleman have make the fair point that there be much to be do to upgrade the road network it be unquestionably the case that there have be massive and utterly unprecedented increase in funding for local authority up and down the country that derive of course from the prime minister october announcement about network north and the plan for driver which make it clear that this government be firmly on the side of the motorist and also firmly on the side of those who wish to improve our road network even before the network north announcement the government be already allocate more than billion to local council in england over the current parliament to enable they to maintain their road on october however the prime minister confirm billion of extra funding for highway maintenance for the next year follow the challenging but necessary decision to scrap the northern leg of this unprecedented funding increase will be additional to what local authority be expect to receive over the period in question it will enable an unprecedented transformation in the condition of our highway and will help to tackle the scourge of pothole local authority in the midland and the north that be not part of mayoral combine authority area will also receive their share of the brand new local integrate transport settlement fund that be announce as part of network north we believe that local community know well what transport solution work in their area and the lits fund will empower local authority to fund the local transport infrastructure that their area need that could include upgrade road junction upgrade pavement reduce congestion and help bus to run more reliably the money could also be spend on additional highway maintenance activity over and above those already fund through the department highway maintenance block if that be local priority and my hon friend the member for stoke on trent north have make it very clear that as far as he be concern it be local priority the department hop to publish the lits allocation for individual local transport authority shortly that is in the next couple of month in keep with the prime minister commitment all funding previously allocate to the north and the midland will still be allocate there which be sure my hon friend will welcome of the billion million be be make available in the current financial year to allow authority to make an immediate start on resurface their road the department make the first payment this be apposite in the context of the debate on december and it will give they their share of an additional million again in let now turn to what this mean for local highway authority in the constituency of my hon friend the member for stoke on trent north stoke on trent city council receive an extra this month as its share of the network north uplift on top of the early increase of that it receive as part of the million uplift announce in the budget that mean that overall stoke on trent will receive more road repair funding than it receive last year which be massive step forward this be we believe real and tangible benefit that the people of stoke on trent will see for themselves and great testament to the work of my hon friend and his stoke on trent colleague in advocate more road investment that share of the uplift be very good news for my hon friend constituent all this take stoke on trent total highway maintenance funding from the department to more than million in the current financial year on top of about million of integrated transport block funding over the full year of network north funding as my hon friend know it be provide for period on continuous basis stoke on trent will receive an additional amount of more than million note that some of my hon friend constituency fall in staffordshire and take on board the point raise by my good friend the hon member for strangford jim shannon some support will also go to staffordshire county council amount to an uplift of more than million this month on top of the increase of million that it receive after the budget over the full year of network north funding staffordshire will receive over million of additional funding this long term certainty give time for local authority and their supply chain to ramp up and then deliver their programme of work the funding be much more than the local highway authority be expect and represent an increase of around two third in the department support for local highway maintenance we want to ensure that the funding deliver transformational improvement in the condition of local road with so much extra funding there also need to be great scrutiny of how the money be spend we will therefore require all local authority to publish by march summary of the additional resurfacing work that they will deliver with the new funding over the next two year they will thereafter publish quarterly report summarise what additional work they have do and which road have be resurface and then publish long term plan for the full use of their year funding and the transformation it will deliver my hon friend raise the issue of ringfencing and want to try to address that clearly this be an important point about the way in which funding be provide to local authority know that some would prefer capital funding for local council to be ringfence and have some sympathy with that argument but the funding be not strictly speak ringfence in law what happen be that in provide it the department make it clear to all local authority that it expect every penny to be spend on highway maintenance activity if there be any evidence that it be not the department make it clear that it reserve the right to reduce future grant payment to the authority those new reporting requirement that we be impose as part of network north will also allow the public as well as member of this house to hold their local authority to account to ensure that we have proper use of the funding we want to introduce proper democratic accountability for taxpayer fund repair to road and upgrade to pothole so that there be proper accountability and we can ensure that this funding be be spend properly my hon friend also make an important point about the way in which the current funding formula work he argue that it should take account of traffic volume as well as road length to reflect the fact that urban road generally carry more traffic and therefore need more maintenance than lightly traffic rural road accept that this be potential argument and it be one that he make with great eloquence although other have push back and represent highly rural community with thousand of mile of road fully understand the alternative argument the funding formula methodology be create follow public consultation in traffic volume and different type of traffic certainly contribute to road wear and tear but there be other factor such as the weather that can cause road to deteriorate the department have no immediate plan to change the formula and we would not do so without consultation with local authority that would unquestionably be require any change would result in winner and loser across the country which would without shadow of doubt be matter of concern to many member of the house and to individual local authority the most important thing the department can do be to increase the overall funding amount to benefit all local highway authority and this be what we have announce with the network north plan obviously as always in this house we take on board the comment make by my hon friend and this be part of the ongoing debate and consideration but stress that it be not our intention to proceed down that route at the moment my hon friend raise specific road think gloucester road be one that he mention and take those point on board clearly good quality road be essential upgrade be important and the good maintenance of the road be vital we be work with local highway authority in england and national highways to assess the condition of road surface but we be also work with the british standards institute and the transport research laboratory to develop new standard for assess road condition which will help council to deal with road defect more effectively we be also encourage the use of new technology into the market one of which be the famous pothole pro that my hon friend mention which be develop in his area it be genuinely innovative way ahead for deal with this and greatly look forward to get involve with it be try to persuade the department to find the appropriate bit of machinery that will then drive to address his particular problem there be some health and safety issue that have to overcome but he will understand that it be mission with which be shortly to engage we want to reduce the time that driver lose and the stress that they experience due to roadwork we be also make it quick and easy for local council to establish lane rental scheme and we be consult on require local authority with such scheme to use at least half of any surplus fund on pothole repair we be also help council to find innovative way to look after their road through the million live labs programme run by the association of directors of environment economy planning and transport which will try new environmentally friendly way of manage and maintain local road in various part of the country through live labs we be test wide range of different highway material to support the move towards net zero carbon for local road and infrastructure my hon friend will be aware of the plan for driver which the government announce in the autumn we be not only try to support motorist in variety of individual way as set out in the plan but we be use taxpayer money to support local authority with record increase in funding there have never be such funding the government be put in place transformational new funding to maintain the local road network over the next year with significant uplift from the present basis we be firmly on the side of the motorist and welcome my hon friend comment question put and agree to house adjourn
