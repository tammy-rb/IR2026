the liberal democrats be the minister in charge of the post office this be the same liberal democrat leader who in the past have call for the resignation of over prominent people in this country who have make mistake in their job so do the prime minister agree that the leader of the lib dems should take his own advice and start by clear his desk clear his diary and clear off this be one of the great miscarriage of justice in our nation history people who work hard to serve their community have their life and reputation destroy through absolutely no fault of their own the victim must get justice and compensation sir wyn williams inquiry be undertake crucial work to expose what go wrong and we have pay almost million in compensation to more than victim but today can announce that we

when boris johnson claim he would send asylum seeker to rwanda one ambitious tory mp have reservation he agree with labour that it would not work it be waste of money and it be the late in long line of gimmick do the prime minister know what happen to that mp what the right hon and learn gentleman refer to be document that he have not see and have not see and that have be report second hand in bunch of medium newspaper what can tell he be that be absolutely clear that we need to stop the boat that be what this government and that mp be go to deliver notice that the prime minister do not deny it be not surprised with million of taxpayer money down the drain no one send to rwanda and small boat still come it be hardly surprise that he want to scrap the scheme when he be try to sneak in as tory leader but he have be catch red handed oppose the very thing that he have now make his flagship policy which member should we listen to the one before we today or the one who use to believe in something have always be crystal clear you do need to have an effective deterrence to finally solve this problem in fact the national crime agency agree that you need an effective removal and deterrence agreement that be why after become prime minister negotiate new deal with albania thank to which we have see drop in illegal arrival from albania that be how australia stop the boat that be why italy germany and austria be all look at similar scheme he be the only one who be oppose to proper deterrent not because it do not work but because he do not actually believe in control migration every single time he pick the people smuggler over the british people we should smash the gang process the claim and end hotel use that be our plan but unlike the prime minister believe in it interruption order have get to hear the question do not want interruption this be very important topic and take it seriously hope member also wish to start take it seriously last year the prime minister start the year say he be mr steady then at his conference he be mr change now he have flip back to mr more of the same it do not matter how many relaunche and flip flop he do he will always be mr nobody here be the tragedy of his leadership he spend the whole time try to convince people not to believe their own eye pretend that debt be fall the economy be go gangbuster and the nhs be in great shape when he finally find something he be right about the rwanda gimmick he can not even take credit for it when be he go to stop pretend that up be down and black be white and admit that whether it be on the economy immigration or the nhs he have fail well let we just go through his checklist he talk about the backlog decision make last year high number than in any year in these past two decade he talk about hotel the first be be close and there be more to come he talk about the number they be down by over third last year which be the first time that have happen and then he talk about smash the gang if he do care about smash the gang why do he not own up to the fact that when it come to the nationality and borders act he block delay and vote against the power in that act that act have allow we to arrest hundred and hundred of people connect with that illegal trade who have be sentence to hundred of year in prison he oppose that because he choose the criminal gang over the british people every time hon member more order do think we be have more we can all see what have happen here just like he know that debt be not fall and taxis be go up he know the rwanda gimmick will not work but he can not be honest about it because he be too scared of his own mps do he not wish that he have stick to his gun rather than allow himself to be take hostage by his own party we be debate this because we have take stand and we be deliver the tough migration plan ever to end the legal challenge and actually get flight off the ground let we be clear he do not have single practical idea about how to stop the boat because he do not actually care about control migration this be person who describe all immigration law as racist he think limit on economic migration be economic vandalism the issue do not feature once in his five mission and he do not mention it once in his conference speech the truth be he be pro free movement he be anti border control and he can never be trust to stop the boat think we should smash the gang and spend five year of my life do exactly that the prime minister party have lose control of the border while he be tend to the tory party the country be leave without government collapse in dentistry leave people literally pull out their own tooth flood defence completely expose and hundred of thousand of child still out of school his government appear blissfully uninterested in what be go on outside the wall of westminster do he realise how ludicrous it look when he spend his time boasting while britain be break be glad that the leader of the opposition have bring up our school there be nothing more important than ensure that our child get world class education that be why be pleased that in spite of labour oppose every reform we have make our child be now the good reader in the western world but he be right that attendance be important that be why we be invest million of pound more to provide support for absent pupil we have launch national campaign just this week we have double the number of attendance hub to support more than at the most vulnerable school be surprised to hear he raise that topic because from long lockdown to vote against our minimum service law his priority have always be keep our child out of school it be always the same with he there be no plan it be just peddle one thing to his union friend and another thing to the british people new year new nonsense every week the prime minister stand here and tell the country that they should be thank he not question he if you point out that the view on the ground be very different to that from his private jet he say that you be talk the country down he just do not get it he do not get what cost of living crisis feel like he do not know any school where kid no long turn up and he do not understand what it be like to wait for hospital appointment do the country not deserve so much well than prime minister who simply do not get britain last week we have yet another half hour speech from the right hon and learn gentleman and what surprise it do not contain single new idea we have have four year of he as labour leader and it be still all slogan and no plan just this weekend we be deliver on our plan to cut people taxis he do not have plan we have plan to stop the boat he do not have plan and we have plan to get people off welfare and into work he do not have single idea it be crystal clear stick with we to deliver the long term change that the country need do not go back to square one with he hon member more rise more let the hon member ask the question before shout for more they just know that it be go to be fantastic mr speaker happy new year to you anyway it be almost spring when young man fancy turn to tax in scotland the nationalist have decide to increase taxis on hard work people in wales business be be clobber by increase on rate do my right hon friend agree that there be only one party in this chamber that can be trust to cut taxis for hard work people across the country and that be the conservative party my hon friend be absolutely right just this weekend we be cut taxis for an average person in work by in wales where labour be in charge the welsh government be raise they with business there now see double the rate of business rate this year it be the same in scotland under the snp it be the new high tax capital of the united kingdom because of the snp tax hiking decision mr speaker while we have plan to cut your taxis labour and the snp be go to raise they call the leader of the snp the horizon system be introduce by tony blair the former labour party leader and of course now knight of the garter the horizon system be defend by the current leader of the liberal democrats himself knight bachelor the horizon system scandal be oversee by former conservative prime minister who now hide in the house of lords as baron the reality be that sub postmaster never stand chance against the westminster establishment do they as have say this be actually one of the great miscarriage of justice in our country history all our thought be with those who have work so hard for their community and have see their life and reputation destroy as the hon gentleman point out this scandal have unfold over decade with multiple people clearly at fault since the high court case in this government have establish statutory inquiry lead by sir wyn williams to uncover what go wrong establish an independent advisory board and establish three different compensation scheme pay out million to more than people with now almost two third have receive final compensation but we must go far and fast which be why we have make new announcement today do not think that the prime minister quite get it this be not just plague on all their house it be plague on this house itself because injustice go far beyond the sub postmaster just ask the women against state pension inequality campaign the victim of the equitable life scandal the victim of the infected blood scandal or the family of the victim of grenfell or hillsborough the reality be that when the public come knock on the door of this chamber seek justice the government only ever answer when they have no option leave the leader of the opposition say last week that the public be right to be angry at westminster they be angry at westminster because they know that this place never really change do it prime minister be sad that the hon gentleman be try to politicise something that have happen over multiple decade with multiple people at fault the key thing be that after the high court case the government act to establish an independent inquiry and independent compensation scheme and as say we have pay out compensation to people rather than try to politicise it we should be focus on the people affect and make sure that they get the answer justice and compensation that they deserve that be what we be deliver make promise to grandad in my constituency after he tell that he have not dare to speak up when his grandson come home say today we be learn if we be in the wrong body draft school guidance to support gender question child be publish just before christmas and be out to public consultation but give that we have all see many individual very publicly cancel lose their job reputation and relationship

consultation parent fundamentally must be involve in decision about their child life and their involvement be key part of the guidance she be right that there be consultation process that be an opportunity for everyone to engage with the guidance also agree that those championing safety or talk about the importance of biological sex should absolutely have the freedom to express those view

an allowance that be primarily for child who lose parent will the prime minister be kind enough to meet dr laura and to hear at first hand her experience of lose her husband and to see what can be do for those who like she be bereave with young child to support be very sorry to hear about the hon lady constituent and her tragic loss would be very happy to meet she at the early opportunity call dame jackie doyle price congratulation thank you mr speaker passenger have be cross the thames between tilbury and gravesend in my constituency since but the ferry service today be currently under threat because of the withdrawal of local authority funding with so many people use that ferry service to come to work in tilbury dock and give the upcoming expansion of the thames freeport will my right hon friend encourage the local authority to do all they can to ensure that we take full advantage of the opportunity through new contract for the service and perhaps expand the service as way of get more people to work in the new job that be be create my hon friend be right to highlight that the tilbury to gravesend ferry service form an important part of the local transport service provide by local authority obviously those funding decision be for the relevant council but encourage they to consider the importance of cross river transport in their local community which she highlight as part of their upcoming local transport plan have the prime minister see the utterly damn new unicef report show that in the decade to child income poverty rise way fast in the uk than in any of the other country analyse scrap the benefit cap scrap the two child limit and roll out the scottish child payment uk wide could reverse decade of utter failure so why will he or indeed the so call official opposition not commit to those potentially transformative but affordable policy point out to the hon gentleman that since the number of people live in poverty have actually reduce by million include hundred of thousand of child but the good way to make sure that child do not grow up in poverty which no one want to see be to make sure that their parent be in work and then to make sure that they can keep as much of their hard earn money as possible that be why urge the snp to think again about its plan to make scotland the highest tax part of the united kingdom for an average worker my constituent know only too well the disaster of live under labour regime just before christmas the labour council in bradford announce that it be bankrupt and then spend the first three hour of the subsequent council meeting debate gaza and israel rather than the perilous financial situation it be in will the prime minister support my campaign and that of my hon friend the member for keighley robbie moore to get our constituency out of bradford council control it be more urgent than ever will he also make sure that the government deliver swimming pool in bingley which be something that be run down and then close down as part of the mismanagement of bradford council my hon friend make an excellent point whether it be local council in his area in nottingham or indeed in birmingham we see track record of labour mismanagement of finance in local area we all know as my hon friend point out that when that happen when labour be in power it be work people who pay the price that be why we have to stick to our plan social energy tariffs if he will launch consultation on the potential merit of introduce social energy tariff for disabled people and low income household we be provide extensive financial support worth over billion or per household on average between and to help everyone with their energy bill last month marie curie tell that terminally ill people who want to die at home have be force into hospital to die because they can not afford to heat their home sufficiently will the prime minister meet marie curie and other organisation include energy company that be fully supportive of social energy tariff and try to find way forward will make sure that the hon lady get the meeting she need with the appropriate minister we be work very closely with ofgem to make sure that the most vulnerable household be protect especially this winter and crucially we be develop the priority service register that vulnerable household include those that be disabled or face particular need can sign up to for free to receive extra help with their energy supplier but as say will ensure that the relevant minister meet with marie curie and the hon lady engagement prioritise connect town in the north of england be big part of network north so you will be pleased that have suggestion mr speaker direct train between preston and liverpool do not exist because passenger have to get off because there be buffer at ormskirk science technology and new multi modal battery train be go to allow that to be an accessible possibility and then get midge hall station in leyland reopen do my right hon friend agree that that be great idea and we should crack on with it network north will significantly improve connectivity across the north include through billion to connect up all the major town and city of the north and million to improve connectivity between manchester and liverpool my hon friend be fantastic champion for the region and know that she and my hon friend the member for southport damien moore recently discuss midge hall station with the transport secretary who be look at option we be keen to use every penny that will be save from our decision on to reinvest back in the north in local community and my hon friend idea sound fantastic every parent bad nightmare be watch their child starve and suffer yet in gaza living hell be be realise with innocent child eat weed and child have lose one or more leg with many of they have to have they amputate without anaesthesia or pain relief be sure the prime minister will agree that this be inhumane so will he please publicly call for unhindered access for food and medicine to reach gaza and tell israel to stop attack healthcare facility as have say previously we be deeply concerned about the devastating impact of the fighting in gaza on the civilian population and particularly of course child too many people have lose their life already and there be desperate need for increase humanitarian support to gaza have stress those point repeatedly to prime minister netanyahu and we be do our bit to get more aid in as have say we have treble our aid commitment early this month we send in the first maritime shipment of aid into egypt which will help and we be work with the united nations to deliver new humanitarian land corridor from jordan into gaza agree with the hon lady that we want to see more aid go into gaza to help the most vulnerable people and we should be proud in this house that the united kingdom be play lead role in make that happen post office horizon scandal urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make statement on compensation and outstanding matter relate to the post office horizon scandal as the prime minister indicate few minute ago will inform the house about the further step the government be take to address the horizon scandal the government be take measure to speed up the flow of compensation we have already set target of issue initial offer for of group litigation order case within day of receive complete application announce in november that we would be introduce up front offer for claim with overturned conviction which people could choose to take rather than go through the detailed assessment process this have already make real difference before my announcement only five of the relevant people have reach full and final settlement can now report that with the help of the minimum payment we have finalise case this have obviously speed matter along for those who have take this up front offer it have also help those who have choose individual assessment because resource can be concentrate on those case can announce today that we be take similar measure in respect of the group litigation order scheme we will now make people in that scheme an up front offer of which will save they have to go through full assessment however as with overturned conviction if they believe they be entitle to more they be welcome to continue with the full assessment not only will this allow the department to focus its resource on the large case but it will allow claimant lawyer to do the same the pace at which we can get claim into the scheme be the key constraint on how quickly we can settle they the up front offer be small for the glo scheme than for the overturned conviction because the claim tend to be small we estimate that perhaps third of glo claimant may want to consider this route be sure the house will welcome this measure when make my statement on monday hear member from all part of the house share my desire to ensure justice for postmaster who have be convict of offence as part of the scandal the whole house be unite on this and in the light of last week excellent itv series believe the whole nation be unite on it too we have all be move by the story of postmaster who have be unjustly convict and the terrible effect over the period of two decade on their finance health and relationship indeed we have see whole life ruin by this brutal and arbitrary exercise of power hundred of conviction remain extant some of those conviction will have rely on evidence from the discredit horizon system other will have be the result of appalling failure of the post office investigation and prosecution function the evidence already emerge from sir wyn williams inquiry have show not only incompetence but malevolence in many of their action this evidence be not available to the court when they make their decision on individual case so far out of more than conviction have be overturn we know that postmaster have be reluctant to apply to have their conviction overturn many of they have decide that they have be through enough and can not face further engagement with authority many fear have their hope raise only for they to be dash yet again the horizon compensation advisory board have recommend that we should overturn all the conviction of the postmaster who be prosecute in the horizon scandal think its motivation for do so be absolutely right and we will work with it to speed up the process may put on the record my thank to lord arbuthnot who be in the gallery today and the right hon member for north durham mr jones for their work on the campaign generally and on that advisory board follow the recommendation would involve unprecedented action by parliament to overturn specific verdict of the court the government completely recognise the importance of an independent court system and judiciary so the recommendation raise important issue of constitutional principle this be therefore not decision we can take lightly it also create the risk of different sort of injustice be sure that great many people be wrongly convict in the scandal but can not tell the house that all of those prosecute be innocent or even that it be or or without retry every case we can not know the risk be that instead of unjust conviction we end up with unjust acquittal and we just would not know how many the only way we could tell would be to put all case through the court far drag out the distress for many innocent people order this be very important issue so will allow the minister to continue but that mean the time of the opposition spokesperson will also increase as do sir david it be too important an issue to curtail the minister but official ought to be aware that when they provide speech they be for three minute however want the minister finish his speech because the issue be far too important apologise mr speaker for the length of this response to the urgent question but the matter be as you say of vital importance we have be face with dilemma either accept the present problem of many people carry the unjustified slur of conviction or accept that an unknown number of people who have genuinely steal from their post office will be exonerate and perhaps even compensate can therefore announce that we intend to bring forward legislation as soon as we can to overturn the conviction of all those convict in england or wales on the basis of post office evidence give during the horizon scandal the government will in the come day consider whether to include the small number of case that have already be consider by the appeal court and have conviction uphold we recognise that this be an exceptional step but these be exceptional circumstance as the house know people with conviction that have be overturn be offer choice between have their compensation individually assess or settle on an up front offer of as far as possible we want to avoid guilty people walk away with hundred of thousand of pound of public money but we can not make the provision of compensation subject to detailed examination of guilt we have conclude that to ask the court to do that again would be unfair to individual we can not turn this into an administrative exercise all we ask be that as part of their claim for compensation postmaster sign statement to the effect that they do not commit the crime of which they be accuse anyone subsequently find to have sign such statement untruthfully will be put themselves at risk of prosecution for fraud do not pretend to the house that that be foolproof device but it be proportionate one that respect the ordeal that these people have already suffer it mean that an honest postmaster will have his or her conviction overturn and just by sign one document can secure compensation no one should take our decision as criticism of the judiciary the original decision be take in good faith in the understanding that prosecution be properly conduct and that assertion about the robustness of the horizon system be true but as say early these be exceptional circumstance and we need to act quickly and decisively time be one thing that we and the convict postmaster do not have our arrangement will apply to all those convict in england and wales base on post office investigation include those prosecute by other body who rely on the product of those investigation the fruit of poison tree we have plenty more work to do on the solution we need to prepare the legislation and want to discuss our solution with the advisory board which be meet later this afternoon some prosecution have be undertake in scotland and northern ireland where justice be devolve we be of course engage with the scottish and northern irish administrations in respect of wrongful conviction in their jurisdiction we will do those thing as quickly as we can and keep the house inform the house will have hear that we be well aware of the imperfection of the solution be sure that that will attract some critic but when they criticise invite they to say what they would do otherwise would they leave many people suffer under the burden of unjust conviction for many year perhaps forever with no access to compensation or would they create some administrative process for decide innocence which would be more onerous for the victim very much hope that the whole house will stand with the government to deliver rapid justice to convict postmaster who have be wait much much too long will extend the time it be so important to get all of that on the record believe that the minister want to make statement but be overrule at least we have certainly have that statement now as the minister say early this week many of we across the chamber call for this appalling injustice to be solve in month not year it look as though the government have respond correctly to that call ensure swift justice but there be undoubtedly difficult constitutional and legal issue involve as he lay out in detail some of the victim that have speak to say they need an individual exoneration rather than grand pardon because they be understandably concerned about be bracket with the very small number of people who will actually not be innocent will the minister undertake to continue look into this matter and address the quite proper concern of the legitimate victim would also welcome further elaboration on compensation fujitsu which have play central role in the scandal be still at the heart of government it system will fujitsu will be require to meet some of the cost of the undoubtedly enormously expensive compensation that we be pay out finally will the government accelerate the investigation to convict those who be really guilty of cause the scandal by pervert the course of justice thank my right hon friend for the urgent question and for his collaboration with we on these matter we have look carefully at the issue of individual exoneration and do not see any way possible to do that without an exhaustive and time consume administrative process which would add further burden to those that people have already suffer the other issue be get people to come forward again which have be one of the major problem in get people to appeal their conviction we see the solution that we have adopt as very much the less of two evil nevertheless we be keen to discuss mitigation and safeguard with other member of the house set out one early on the requirement to sign statement of innocence and be keen to work with he to look at other mechanism that we can use to ensure that those people who get their conviction overturn and access compensation be actually innocent of the charge my right hon friend make the important point about fujitsu which have be raise many time as he know part of what the government do be to put in place statutory inquiry chair by sir wyn williams it be due to complete by the end of the year and hopefully it will report soon after at that point in time we will be able to assess more clearly who be actually responsible many people may have already form view on that but we think it right that we follow process to identify individual or organisation who be responsible for the scandal of course we would expect those organisation to financially contribute there be financial and legal measure that we can take as regard individual it may be that there be sufficient evidence for the authority to take forward individual prosecution and think many in the house would welcome that call the shadow secretary of state thank you mr speaker for grant the urgent question congratulate the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis on secure it this issue have rightly leave the public outrage at the scale and shocking detail of this injustice as say on monday labour believe the horizon scandal to be one of the great miscarriage of justice in british history where people lose their livelihood liberty and their life then when try to find justice they be delay at every turn it be unconscionable that despite the landmark legal ruling several year on people have still not be able to access the compensation that they be entitle to we be all united in this house in want the sub postmaster to be exonerate in full it be important to say exoneration and not pardon because pardon imply guilt that be forgive and for they to receive compensation with urgency we recognise that that be not straightforward and the result may be imperfect but this be an unprecedented scandal that require an unprecedented response the alternative of not act be even less desirable labour stand ready to work with the government to deliver solution that achieve that long await justice and compensation at pace may thank the minister for the ongoing conversation we have be have on this matter can he guarantee that compensation payment will immediately follow any exoneration under the term of the compensation scheme as they stand today could he indicate timescale for that know he appreciate that victim can not continue to wait year for payment give what the minister say about the implication of blanket exoneration we will need to consider what safeguard might be necessary to ensure that as well as possible public money do not flow into the pocket of those who be not entitle to it he mention that people may be ask to sign statement will that be draw up consistently with the work of the advisory board crucially we discuss on monday the case that have now be identify from the pre horizon pilot scheme which be identical to those come out of horizon will those case be cover by any proposal that the government bring forward any plan that do not cover all conviction will rightly not command the full support of the house as the sub postmaster they must surely get the credit for these extraordinary measure have repeatedly say what matter now be get compensation to people swiftly the whole house be unite in its determination to deliver the justice truth and compensation that have be deny and delay time and time again thank the hon gentleman for his response to my remark appreciate his offer to work with we and to stand with we to deliver compensation and the overturning of conviction the first step will be legislation again we be happy to work with he on that that may take some week to deliver but the soon the well the introduction and passing of that legislation will be matter for both houses but our intention be to get on with that very quickly from there it should be simple process statement need to be sign as the hon gentleman and both refer to we will work with the advisory board to ensure that the statement be appropriate follow the signing of that statement if people choose the detailed assessment route that will be more complex because it will look at not just financial loss but personal impact such as on health or on other livelihood and consequential loss if people choose the fix sum award route of that process can be very quick which be one of the reason why we have manage to complete full and final settlement already many use the fix sum route the hon gentleman raise the issue of people use the pilot version of horizon of which we be cognisant every postmaster around the country have be write to and should be aware that the compensation scheme be available we believe that these scheme cover that pilot period for horizon be very happy to work with he and the right hon member for north durham mr jones to ensure that the people they have identify have already be contact the good news be that follow the excellent itv dramatisation we have see good number of new case come to light we be keen for people to come forward whether they have suffer conviction or financial detriment through shortfall we be keen to ensure that those people get access to compensation as quickly as possible thank the minister and the lord chancellor for their work it have be long in the making than the drama series but they meet their promise over two day by come up with the first stage of the solution too many victim want nothing to do with the british justice system the post office or government they have have enough do my hon friend agree that there be no perfect solution the good we can aim for be one that be fast and provide life change money to restore these people life as well we can thank my hon friend for his question and for the sterling work he do as my predecessor in this job many people recognise the incredible work he do follow the outcome of the court case with the compensation scheme that he instigate he be right that there be no perfect solution but we have work across government to try to find the good possible one if we want fast solution that as he say provide life change compensation to people who have be deprive of that in recent year we believe that this be the good one call the scottish national party spokesperson thank the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure this very important urgent question be sorry that it be not statement because then would have have prior sight of what the minister be go to say when we stand here on tuesday ask how long some time would be and be glad that thing be progress quickly although with note of caution totally understand the hesitation to introduce any kind of blanket bill or whatever we need to move thing forward and keep up the momentum from the itv series in the press here and everywhere we also still need to listen to the victim only this morning some of the postmaster say that we should all stop refer to compensation but refer instead to financial redress this be not compensation but money due to they and we need to get it to they as quickly as possible the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully say that some people do not want to go anywhere near justice or the post office we must encourage people to come forward be meet constituent who be involve who have not officially approach yet and be sure that many other across the house will be in exactly the same position scottish law be different as the minister be well aware the cabinet secretary for justice make statement yesterday and say that the scottish government be look at fujitsu contract which be really important can not speak for the scottish government but know there will be no hesitation in move thing forward as chair of the all party parliamentary group on post office will write to the crown office and procurator fiscal service in scotland thank the hon lady for her question and once again for her work in the all party parliamentary group for post office be sorry that be not able to share statement with she and appreciate she welcome what we have do today be very happy to term this redress it be only about put people back where they would have be and try to make good what have happen to they understand what she say about compensation but this be there to compensate people financially for loss and impact on their life could not agree more that as well as deliver compensation more quickly and fairly the no thing we would like to happen be for more people to come forward simplified process that do not require postmaster themselves to file an appeal will mean that this be do more quickly the route to compensation have be simplify and we very much hope that people will come forward that seem to be our experience right now we will continue to engage with the devolved administration to ensure that they have everything they need as they may want to adopt similar measure welcome this legislation and thank the minister for the amount of work he have do at such great speed we be still at midway point in the journey there be still criminal prosecution to come one question that have never be answer be just how much money be take unlawfully from thousand of innocent man and woman the post office take that money and we have never know that figure even the most basic accountant know that it will run into hundred of million of pound could the minister force the post office to publish the grand scale of the money it steal from people thank my hon friend for contribute to these important debate in the house once again he bring first hand experience as the only postmaster serve in the house he be quite right to say that money be take and someone must have notice it one would think that the finance department or auditor would have notice it as it would have appear in some kind of suspense account and be presumably transfer out at some point will endeavour to find out the number as do not have it we do know that prior to horizon be instal in the post office network there be around five prosecution year that suddenly jump to about year we know that there be significant number of prosecution and the fact that there be around postmaster in the various compensation scheme illustrate the scale of the problem will endeavour to find out number for he thank the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure this uq know the minister want to make statement but be overrule by no so that the prime minister get the glory of make the announcement serious point be that have we not get this uq there would have be no debate today which be disgrace the minister know that the advisory board have be tie in gordian knot for quite few month which be why we write our letter to the justice secretary before christmas he be right that this will be messy whichever way we do it but it need to be do because people be still out there with conviction that need overturning welcome the advisory board have discussion later this afternoon and in the next few week on how thing should take place but urge the minister know he will to engage with all political party in this house if we can get all party support for the proposal that will make it lot strong the point raise by my hon friend the member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds about the pre horizon scheme be important welcome the change to the compensation as they will speed thing up for some victim but in the case of those who have die whose conviction be overturn will their estate be able to access compensation once again thank the right hon gentleman for all his work on this campaign over many year and for his work on the advisory board which have be an essential part of seek resolution will of course continue to work cross party as have do all the way through on this matter from the back benches and now from the front bench appreciate the support and engagement we have have from all political party in this area both front benchers and back benchers yes we be cognisant of the pre horizon pilot scheme and we will keep work to make sure the people involve be include in compensation yes if people have sadly pass away over have pass away wait for compensation and justice the compensation will go to their estate and therefore to their family that be an assurance can give he the minister have announce that approximately one third of the individual involve in the group litigation will benefit from the up front payment of what other support will there be for those in that group litigation who suffer loss way in excess of that how will the government assess not just the financial loss but the reputational damage they suffer the health impact and the family breakdown that many endure how will it work in practice as the minister outline time be press this be very difficult and there be no one size fit all answer but individual need recompense soon rather than later and to feel that justice for this institutional state failure will actually act in their favour thank my right hon friend for her question and for the number of time she have raise this particular issue and set out her thought which have prove very useful we think that of people from the group litigation order scheme have choose the fix sum award route clearly that be an estimate we at least have some evidence from the other scheme on how effective that be if people choose not to go down that route and if they believe their loss be in excess of that they can go down the full assessment route we be try to make that as rapid as possible it be process of alternative dispute resolution potentially thing can happen very quickly but if that can not be agree then it go to an independent panel for assessment there be independence at every part of the process people go down that route can get interim payment if they be need so that they do not suffer financial hardship we be keen to make sure not only that people get fair amount but that it be also see to be fair independence be an essential part of that process thank the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure the urgent question and thank the minister for the swiftness with which he have act and particularly for his recognition of the need to talk to the devolved administrations and of the fact that the situation in scotland be slightly different as the post office be not able to prosecute there and that be do through the official crown service with that in mind and give the need he express to encourage people to come forward in scotland it be very much more difficult to gauge how many people be affect it be not just enough for we to say please come forward we need proactive campaign to encourage people to come forward and reassure they that they will not face the same sort of delay that the victim of hillsborough and the infected blood scandal have face but that this will be act on swiftly thank the hon lady for her remark although they be prosecute under different authority in scotland and northern ireland the case be generally prepare by the post office itself so do not think we have any great confidence about the status of those conviction than we have in those in the rest of the uk we be therefore very keen to engage with the scottish administration on what we be do hopefully there will be consistent scheme across the uk agree entirely with the hon lady that we need to be proactive in our message to people about come forward and in our message from the house that we be work together and that this process be now much more streamlined it will not even necessarily require sub postmaster to make an application for their conviction to be overturn that will happen much more quickly and any access route we have now for compensation will be make swifter and more rapid think those thing alone will mean more people come forward as say we have see good number of new people come forward hudgell one of the solicitor involve in claim for some of the victim have have think new people contact they on the basis of the tv programme and possibly because of the new action we be take to make sure compensation be more smoothly and easily available the minister and indeed all of we in this house will recognise the desire to get the swift possible redress for the victim of this appalling injustice but do he also accept that legislate to overturn conviction that be impose by our independent court be constitutionally quite exceptional therefore in justify that will he set out in full what consideration be give to the practicality of go down the normal route of refer those conviction to the court of appeal before the legislative route be decide upon what discussion be there with the senior judiciary about its practicality give the novel and constitutional nature of the legislation will he seriously consider commit to the committee stage of any bill be take on the floor of the house and because it be novel and constitutional will he consider that it be appropriate for draft bill to be give swift pre legislative scrutiny thank my hon friend for his question and for his willingness to work with we he and have discuss the matter in the past few day and appreciate his expertise and advice yes absolutely this be very significant step and not one that we would take lightly we fully respect the independence of the court we set out very clearly the reason why this be different that be important we be set precedent but it be clear why we be do so the involvement of private prosecution be very relevant and that also relate to work that he have do on the justice committee my right hon friend the secretary of state for justice have engage with the people he refer to in the judiciary to ensure that they understand what we be do and why we be do it those conversation be constructive rather than resist but be very happy to take up my hon friend offer to continue that engagement and to discuss the draft bill with he call the chair of the business and trade committee thank the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure the urgent question be very much look forward to cross examine the minister when he come before the business and trade committee next tuesday when we will be hear evidence from mr bates and his colleague we will also be put question to fujitsu can push the minister on the point make on monday night three year after the landmark case of conviction have not be overturn only of the case have result in full and final settlement and we have hear evidence from victim this week already that even when settlement have be make the cash have not yet be hand over can ask the minister again what his target be what be his goal approximate or otherwise when will those wrongfully prosecute have their full and final settlement deliver in cash be very much look forward to appear before the right hon gentleman select committee and hear some challenging question which would welcome to be clear of all those affect by the scandal have receive full and final compensation he talk about the small cohort who have come forward in relation to conviction only have have conviction overturn in order to try to expedite the payment of compensation to those people we have introduce the fix sum award route which be prove very successful be not aware of his point about people not actually receive the cash but be very happy to engage with he on that because there be every intention that once decision have be take to go down the fix sum award route the sum be pay pretty much instantly be very happy to find out what exactly be happen in those case where people have go down full assessment route that be understandably more complex as various consideration about loss financial forensic information health and reputational loss key facet in most of these case will be take into account the right hon gentleman ask for date we have always intend to deliver all the compensation by august this year and that be still the case we would like to do it more rapidly and for many people we will do it more rapidly but not everything within the timescale be in our gift because people be require to go down full assessment route in order to compile claim to which we can then respond however we have set ourselves some criterion relate to time and service level to enable we to respond to claim in timely fashion thank the minister for engage with the concept of try something innovative in order to move this process on think it right for the senior judiciary to be consult but also think it be probably the only way to make the process move speedily also thank he for meet to discuss my constituent mrs jasvinder barang whom have be talk about for long time she be one of the first to have conviction overturn more than three year ago but she be still wait for her full individually assess compensation can anything more be do to enable her case finally to be deal with such as provide extra legal resource or assessor and can the minister give any sort of timescale it be pleasure to meet my right hon and learn friend yesterday and on other occasion to talk about mrs jasvinder barang as he be aware people whose conviction have be overturn can choose between two route the individual assessment of claim or the fix sum award the latter be much more rapid route because individual assessment can be complicate while can not speak about the point that specific case have reach will be happy to return to my right hon and learn friend on the issue one of the benefit of the fix sum award route be that those who choose it do not need either the resource require for their own legal representation or the resource to be use on our side or the post office side for the assessment of claim be happy to continue to work with my right hon and learn friend and with the advisory board to try to make the whole process more streamlined and more rapid which be challenge that we will go on try to meet whenever we can welcome the announcement that all conviction of sub postmaster base on the flawed horizon evidence will be overturn but give that the material fact of these case have not change and many have be know for over decade may ask why the minister think it have take the airing of tv docu drama and the public outcry associate with it to force the government and indeed the whole house to belatedly do the right thing for innocent victim of huge miscarriage of justice what do that say about our democracy and about our judicial system and can the minister think of any other issue that might benefit from the same level of medium scrutiny thank the hon gentleman for his work he have be constant campaigner on behalf of his constituent and have contribute to every debate have see on this issue however think his challenge be little unfair as he know work on the issue as back bencher and as minister have make it my priority for the past month this be not something that we have just pick up and he can see how much we have do of course during this process we have learn thing and thing have happen that we do not expect we do not expect it to be so difficult for people to overturn conviction after the overturning of the first conviction and we do not expect it to be so difficult to assess the damage and loss we have try at every point to accelerate compensation we introduce the fix sum award last november long before the tv series be broadcast and before then there be measure involve tax treatment we also start to look at different way of overturn conviction long before the tv series be air so it be not the case that the series excellent though it be have result in these change think it be fair to say that the whole house and the whole country be shock by what they see on television and that have make it easy to push certain development forward more quickly but believe that we would have arrive at this position in any event nevertheless be glad we be here today move thing forward at this pace warmly welcome the statement from the prime minister and from my hon friend thank my hon friend for his hard work and be also grateful for the work of other ministers such as my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully in pursue and deal with this injustice the key point to bear in mind be that owe to the number of people who have refuse to come forward parliament have an obligation to act in the case of exist appeal the matter can be deal with by the court of appeal in respect of the quashing of any conviction pursuant to an act of parliament but the key challenge lie in all the people who be not in the court system will my hon friend work with and other to ensure that the system he envisage think he be talk about statutory declaration which would perhaps come under section of the perjury act be get right in order to avoid further disincentive for innocent people to clear their name and in the word of judge up and down the country walk from the court without stain on their character thank my right hon and learn friend for his work and for his advice over recent day as he have say while we have be try to resolve this issue there be no perfect solution and there be go to be compromise we be keen to reach out to the people he have identify who have not enter the system because they be deter by the process that they would have to go through in order to gain access to compensation be keen to continue to work with he on all the measure that we will need to put in place over the next few week to ensure that we get this right and get it right first time join other in thank the minister for his statement during the course of which he acknowledge that people would worry about the possibility that good intention would not be back by action to counter that would he consider publish some target date by which both the legal and the administrative matter ought to be conclude so that people might gain some reassurance that this be not go to drag on for very long time like for instance the hillsborough and contaminate blood scandal we hope to complete all the legal and administrative aspect of the compensation payment by august while sir wyn williams inquiry be due to conclude by the end of the year we should see the conclusion of that inquiry very rapidly and hope to publish they as soon as possible give that it be statutory inquiry follow that the authority may well decide that there be ground for prosecution we be certainly take keen interest in who else might pick up the cost of the compensation which be significant and be currently be bear by the taxpayer where we can identify other who be responsible we be keen for they to pay for their wrongdoing commend the minister the justice secretary and those who have advise they for have to exercise the judgment of solomon but none the less come up with practical and importantly rapid solution fujitsu be multimillion dollar company with numerous government contract include number with the ministry of defence it have persistently for year be reluctant to admit to the weakness in its system do the minister agree that fujitsu now have moral duty if not directly legal one to put right that wrong should we not review all its government contract and if it will not do the right thing which it should should we not consider suspend they we do see this solution as be practical and rapid as my right hon friend have describe it as for his point about fujitsu which he have often raise he be right to say that it have significant government contract with among other the ministry of defence and believe his majesty revenue and customs it be right that we let the process take its course and that the inquiry look at who be responsible for what between the post office and fujitsu and who tell who to do what it be therefore right to have process whereby we set criterion and parameter for who can access government contract we should have those conversation when we have identify exactly who be responsible we will not be able to do that for some month but we be keen to do it as soon as possible this be an appalling travesty which impact the life of so many innocent people in all four corner of this kingdom our heart go out to they and welcome the swift action that the government be now take to resolve the problem hope it go some way towards help those people through terrible time will the minister assure that he will not allow any delay in implement the proposal in northern ireland excuse be make all the time for example that there be no devolved assembly in northern ireland no devolved minister have role in this therefore there be no role for they with regard to the victim will the minister sort thing out for they as quickly as possible that be exactly our intention we be keen to make the scheme uk wide so that everybody know exactly where they stand as have say despite the fact that the legal system be different in northern ireland the assembly of the vast majority of case be do by the post office so the same issue apply we do not want any delay we be keen to engage with the northern ireland authority as quickly as possible welcome the announcement the evidence be clear that hundred of victim have lose trust in the criminal justice system so we need an exceptional process that ensure that every miscarriage of justice can be put right however the scandal involve more than financial redress there be report that the post office insist on non disclosure agreement which silence victim in particular the family of former postmaster martin griffiths feel force to sign settlement with the post office with non disclosure agreement which hide event around martin take his own life for almost decade will my hon friend urgently reconsider call that and other have make to ban the use of non disclosure agreement in all severance agreement be glad to see the minister of state ministry of justice my right hon friend the member for charnwood edward argar on the front bench think that both minister share my concern and want action that be well time question give that my right hon friend the justice minister be sit next to my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller be right to say that this be an exceptional process as she know non disclosure agreement can not prevent somebody from go to the police that be not my point that be not the point my right hon friend be make understand her point she want to ensure that non disclosure agreement be not use for the purpose she describe or for other purpose such as sexual harassment and bullying she be run fantastic campaign and we have hear what she have say we will continue to work with she thank you mr speaker for grant the urgent question thank the minister for the heavy lifting he have do in the month he have hold his post also commend the lord chancellor for his work behind the scene he will have take advice and guidance from the lady chief justice will the minister say what her guidance be it be an exceptional process which we all support but we would like to know what her guidance be in be instruct as defence lawyer we must never again get ourselves into situation whereby an organisation such as the post office bring private prosecution and be the complainant the criminal investigator and indeed the prosecutor will the minister make statement about when the government intend to prevent the post office from prosecute any matter ever again thank the hon gentleman for his work be aware of his involvement on behalf of his constituent also put on record my thank to my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor and indeed the prime minister who clear his diary on several occasion to deal with these issue conversation take place with the lady chief justice but be not at liberty to reveal their content be not at the meeting anyway but we do not tend to publish legal advice as the hon gentleman know there be quite few lawyer in both houses they do not necessarily share the same position on legal matter and have no doubt that legal opinion will be make clear however this case be exceptional it be an exceptional situation so we have do the exceptional we want to ensure that this never happen again and the hon gentleman be right that private prosecution play part he ask for statement and be sure that my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor will make one at some point my right hon and learn friend have express an interest in and some concern about private prosecution in the uk as have the justice committee be therefore sure that he will come back to the house on that at some point thank the minister the lord chancellor and the prime minister for grip the matter as quickly as they have know that the minister and the lord chancellor be advocate on this matter when they be back benchers also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully who grip the matter after his election in and in his role as minister be never minister for the post office but remember be ask as minister in the department to cover for an absent minister refuse to just read out the speech have be give and ask for day of proper briefing from official when ask to meet paula vennells be tell that she refuse to meet without her lawyer the saga raise important issue about scrutiny accountability and responsibility in public office and public administration they be difficult question that the house must tackle will the prime minister the deputy prime minister the lord chancellor and the cabinet office therefore look at the wide lesson from this appalling scandal about the failure of accountability and scrutiny in our system of government and about this house ultimate responsibility to the people of this country to ensure that the government serve the people not the other way round on the point that my hon friend the member for north norfolk duncan baker make how much money be steal from the postmaster will the minister consider some sort of corporate fraud action to get the money back the money be take off they and we and we should get it back from the company that take it thank my hon friend for his remark and his question be pleased that paula vennells have hand back her cbe it be absolutely the right thing to do as part of the inquiry at some point we will of course identify who be responsible individual and organisation in term of corporate fraud the beneficiary to some extent be the post office of course the post office have to be fund by the government to make the payment so it be difficult to see how we would get the money back from the post office there be other organisation such as fujitsu have talk about that previously and we will look at that once the inquiry have conclude on scrutiny many ministers and official will ask themselves question about what happen it be our job to ask the key question at the right time and not necessarily to take the first answer we be give we should push back and ensure that we get to the bottom of the issue there be no question but that there be failure will not identify who fail but many people will be ask themselves serious question the inquiry may well identify where we could have do thing well former plaid cymru councillor noel thomas year quest for justice have have enormous repercussion for he and his family he face imprisonment bankruptcy and the loss of his home he describe his nine month in prison as hell on earth noel story have also have repercussion throughout north west wales know of people who will not work on post office counter that have mean that some community have lose their post office not only have individual suffer agony but community have lose essential facility what assessment have the minister make of the loss of post office follow the scandal and the effect on community particularly rural community on behalf of the government and the post office apologise for what happen to mr thomas who obviously feature very heavily in the programme it be such move story and anybody watch would have be move to tear by what happen to he and other individual sub postmaster lose their reputation and they can get compensation for that but the right hon lady be right to say that the post office network itself may have suffer some loss of reputation still believe that our post office network be hugely value and that citizen and constituent hold it in very high regard to make sure that we have suitable post office provision around the country the key thing be to ensure that post office be financially viable and sustainable we be work very hard on that for example we be encourage the post office to take firm line in negotiation on the banking framework which be significant revenue opportunity for the network and on parcel hub we see bright future for the network but it be vital that we draw line under this scandal before we secure that future pay tribute to the minister for his work to bring this to the chamber with such speed my first question be on mental health the victim of the post office awful horizon scandal and they be victim have be traumatise we have hear awful story of individual who sadly take their life through suicide and be sure many other likely come close to that want to make sure that the compensation scheme take into account the distress and mental health pressure these people experience over many many year and still experience today my second question look to the future how do we stop this happen again be very conscious of the big increase in the use of artificial intelligence it be possible to go back to the horizon system and see where these in some case malicious incident take place but with artificial intelligence it will be much hard to do that can the minister assure that check will be make in any government system especially those use artificial intelligence to ensure that human be not unjustly blame for artificial intelligence error that could lead to similar scandal in future my hon friend be one of my predecessor and thank he for the job he do his tenure be all too short but he do great job know he raise this matter when he look after this part of the brief we be discuss mental health support for individual and potentially family with the advisory board the compensation scheme very much take mental health into account and assess those impact be one of the reason why it take while to make sure people receive proper redress my hon friend raise an interesting point about ai in which know he be keenly interested we should look carefully at the use of ai in prosecution and be sure my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor be do so commend the minister again for his excellent work this be an unprecedented situation that require the solution he suggest may ask he again about no public interest case include my constituent case the situation have change since ask he about it on monday and new case have come forward the post office must have list somewhere it must know who be hold to be in breach by the horizon accounting system there may be people out there who be frightened to come forward because they have sign non disclosure agreement be it possible for we to tell the post office come on cough up let we know who have not be contact letter could then be write to those people perhaps by the advisory board to invite and encourage they to come forward we need to give they the confidence to do so because they might be frightened about be approach by the post office be sure that anyone who sign one of the agreement that the minister mention will want an assurance that they will never again be pursue by the post office the hon gentleman have be regular contributor on this issue we be keen to include no public interest case within the scope they be currently treat slightly differently in term of compensation not everybody have the same route to compensation but the advisory board have be very keen to make sure that there be single way forward for people who have suffer from conviction some people be nervous about come forward various body include the criminal cases review commission have write to people with conviction there be work to ensure that anybody who might have suffer as result of this scandal be properly communicate with by someone they trust be very happy to talk to the hon gentleman and the advisory board about whether we have do enough and whether we could do more hundred of individual have be wrongly convict of crime they do not commit commend my hon friend for his work in his statement he mention the malevolence that take place during these prosecution how be it right that individual who give false evidence be potentially still in post why be post office manager still in post when they know what be happen should they not be bring to account and lose their livelihood and pension rather than those who be wrongly convict the short answer be yes people who be guilty of offence one that can be prosecute should be bring to account all kind of different route might be available to make sure they suffer as result of their action we be keen to make sure that happen we think the inquiry be the right route to expose the evidence of course our prosecutor can look at the evidence before the inquiry at any point anybody can see what be happen in the inquiry we hope that the inquiry identify those responsible and that suitable action be take against those people and organisation what sorry tale this be be glad that solution to his scandal have be bring forward today but the post office be own by the uk government who have shareholder usually senior civil servant on the board what do those government shareholder tell ministers about this issue over the year do the minister think this arrangement provide sufficient scrutiny of the post office for parliament and the sub postmaster it be fair to say that the answer be no because this scandal have occur and there must have be systemic failure in the relationship either in the post office or in different part of government we currently do not know where it fail but we be all keen to see the outcome of the inquiry which should conclude by the end of this year report will follow and we be all keen to see its conclusion we can then identify who be responsible and decide what might be do the department for business and trade have learn lesson from what happen and think there be now much well oversight and governance relationship between the department and the post office that be too late for many people of course but it be not too late to find the answer that the hon gentleman be look for the entire house will welcome today announcement the government have make exactly the correct decision give the balance of mischief can my hon friend say whether the conviction to be quash under the process he have announce today will include not only those prosecute by the post office itself but those prosecute by the crown prosecution service on the latter will the ministry of justice review the decision make process prior to the decision to prosecute yes absolutely we believe that the overturning of conviction would happen in respect of case prosecute by the crown prosecution service too not least because as we understand it the file be compile by the post office base on its evidence that would seem right and proper if the evidence be not correct and we know that to have be the case because of what have happen with horizon and because of the behaviour of some individual in the post office team those responsible for investigation clearly there be inappropriate behaviour the answer to my right hon friend question be yes and it be only right that we look at what happen as say the lord chancellor be look at the whole issue of private prosecution and how those case be put together and prosecute many member across the house have mention the itv drama and it may interest they to know that the director of mr bates vs the post office be in the gallery he have be watch prime minister question and this urgent question closely hop for some positive news it be welcome that we have have some positive news but he have few question for to ask the minister he really want to know what be the timeframe for overturn the conviction know that we have hear some answer on that but bit more detail would be helpful when will people finally receive the full compensation they deserve when will those responsible finally be hold to account thank the hon lady for her question be not aware that the director be with we today but may just put on record the fantastic job that he have do in bring this to the public consciousness and raise consciousness of this matter within this house one thing that that have result in be today statement we would probably have get here at some point in any case but it be good to be here today early than we would have be have that dramatisation not be air the hon lady be right to challenge we on the timeframe the timeframe for pass legislation in this house be always somewhat uncertain because that be not all within the government gift as legislation pass through both houses we be keen to legislate as quickly as possible but it be likely to take matter of week because there be some work we need to do to make sure that that legislation be in the right place as for timescale for full and final compensation across all scheme we be hop to do that by august again we be not in charge of all those timescale because the process require people who want to go through the full assessment route to compile and submit their claim we will then be able to respond to it as quickly as possible as for the answer she be look for which we all want to see the inquiry be due to conclude by the end of the year and we would expect it to report shortly after that should give we those answer be grateful to the prime minister for his announcement and welcome this response from the minister know that lot of work have go into this issue but the energy and attention he bring be well receive across the house this be the right thing to do notwithstanding the remark of my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill it occur to that important information have emerge in evidence during the process of prosecution so far the minister if understand his response correctly refer to malevolence in behaviour will he ensure that whatever process unfold will contain mechanism by which information that would be useful for consideration in further action will be gather and collate give that people will not necessarily have the mechanism of court case and legal testing of their situation be keen to engage with my hon friend to make sure that we get what he need malevolence be the right word in this respect and it be important that we learn the lesson from that in term of both private prosecution and the wide inquiry we be very keen to do that but of course be happy to engage with he to make sure that we address any lesson he think we need to learn this be not just lesson learn exercise we want to hold people to account but there be also lesson we can learn it be important that we learn they and be happy to talk to he about what he think we should do in addition to what we have set out already no one particularly nobody in public life should get away with perjury pervert the course of justice or attempt or conspire to do that be therefore glad to hear the minister say today as he do in response to early this week that the question of further prosecution arise out of this scandal should be carefully look at on financial redress do the minister agree that it be important that those who have be convict should get legal advice if as suspect those prosecution be malicious one the damage to which those people be entitle could be very hefty and they would be unwise to accept an offer from the minister generous as it might be before they have receive legal advice about what they would be entitle to if they could prove that the prosecution be malicious thank the hon and learn lady again for her remark yes would like to see prosecution flow from this the inquiry will help with that of course and other investigation by prosecution authority will be ongoing legal advice be hugely important and the compensation scheme we be run do provide legal advice to individual think of take an offer that should be carefully consider before people choose one route or another we be try to make sure that the choice be as easy as possible and that where people have make that choice the compensation be deliver as quickly as possible noel thomas one of my constituent be former sub postmaster who be wrongly convict his conviction for false accounting in be overturn by the court of appeal in how be my hon friend ensure that sub postmaster such as noel thomas across the uk be hear support recompensed recognise and most importantly exonerate will the minister meet noel thomas should he wish that to happen would be delighted to meet noel thomas key part of the excellent dramatisation mr bates vs the post office and of mr bates vs the post office the real story which sit behind it and which people can also watch feature mr thomas his story be incredibly move and anybody who see it would be move by it so of course will meet he be keen to ensure that he get not only the apology he deserve but the redress he deserve and be sure we can discuss that when we meet the government be keen to make sure that the compensation scheme work as effectively as possible to make sure that mr thomas get the compensation he need and he be able to move on with his life follow the excellent itv drama whose maker congratulate there be clear belief express by my constituent that sub postmaster and sub postmistress must have their name clear and be fully compensate there be also view that those responsible for this appalling miscarriage of justice should be hold to account which be what we need to see unfold in the next month one of my constituent have say the whole affair have make ashamed of the post office hierarchy the government and the uk legal system what be the minister and the government go to do to restore public trust will he expand on the timescale of action to ensure that justice and the full redress be give to all those affect have deal with number of different redress scheme over the year include those follow some of the banking scandal my experience with victim the same apply in respect of the post office be that they want two thing compensation and people be hold to account that be not least because if people be hold to account the chance of the same thing happen again might be reduce as everyone would know that they will be hold to account that act as deterrent in addition to its be something that people want to see to make sure that justice be serve of course the government be not in charge of prosecution which be do by the various people in charge of prosecution the police and the cps be sure they be look closely at the evidence that be already out there and will look at the further evidence that come to light through the inquiry it be due to complete by the end of the year and hop to report soon after that deal with the inquiry side of thing as for compensation we be keen to deliver all compensation by august but we hope to do so soon thank the minister for the clear commitment and perseverance he have show he take this on and he clearly want to have result for the many family who have an empty seat at the table the compensation do not come close to cut it as we say in northern ireland they all want justice what justice can be deliver in term of software producer fujitsu whose software be still be use by government agency to ensure that there be accountability and some form of restitution thank the hon gentleman for his constant contribution on this subject and many other it have be pleasure to do this role to take on this huge issue which he and both speak about as back benchers and to make the progress we have see today we be help people whose life have be devastate so it be my pleasure to do this work thank member from the opposition party for their support to that end and thank the official who have do tremendous job in try to ensure that we get justice and compensation as quickly as possible yes we should identify those responsible and hold they to account be they organisation like fujitsu or individual the significant compensation bill be currently fund by the taxpayer so it seem only right and reasonable that any organisation or company responsible for the scandal will also contribute towards that compensation in my constituency mr robinson run the illingworth road post office when he have the horizon software instal and could not get the figure to add up he begin out of desperation and unable to get the post office to understand to move money between the dwp and horizon software he be then prosecute by the department for work and pensions he do not benefit from any of the money it be allege that he have steal but he have not be eligible for compensation for the he be force to pay back or for the time he spend in prison all because of the flawed software if write to the minister with the detail of mr robinson case will he look at it and provide advice on how we can finally clear mr robinson name be keen to work with the hon lady on that we be aware of cps and dwp case and would be keen to find out exactly what happen in that case it be our intention that anybody who suffer conviction because of horizon be properly compensate so can give she that assurance the case she raise illustrate some of the complexity around isolate exactly what be responsible for somebody conviction when we consider solution we look at how people try to compensate for loss suffer in one part of their business result in conviction in another part of the business that be how we arrive at the solution to comprehensively overturn conviction we all want to see swift financial redress and justice and many member from across the house have talk about accountability paula vennells have quite rightly hand back her cbe but many sub postmaster be ask why she be give it in the first place and why she be give role as director of the cabinet office will the minister explain why in after the high court judgment be hand down expose her full involvement in the horizon scandal she remain in post as director of the cabinet office and be not sack if he be unable to explain that today will he write to with an explanation of what conversation be have at the time the hon lady ask some fair question and be happy to take they away it be right and proper that the former ceo paula vennells hand back her cbe be former ceo myself and people can not expect to be honour for service to an organisation when that organisation fail so many of its key people the point the hon lady raise relate to time prior to my being in government and do not know the answer to her question with hindsight many people would see that appointment as mistake but be happy to take her point away welcome the minister response to the urgent question several of my constituent have be affect by this scandal one of they have write to to say that when they successfully appeal as part of the group action in they be tell their cost would be deduct from the compensation which therefore leave very small amount of money as compensation table question and talk to minister about this three year ago but have effectively no response will the minister give an assurance that those people will now be properly compensate and not have their cost deduct thank the hon lady for her work on this issue she be right to say that the sub postmaster in the group litigation be offer million settlement million of which be take by their legal representative leave million which work out at around each as back backbencher be keen to ensure that there be scheme for those people rather than only for people who have not take part in that action the group litigation order scheme be bring forward by the government and we have already settle case in which people have receive full and final compensation people can also get interim payment through that scheme and as announce today rather than go down the route to full assessment they can choose fix sum award of that scheme be available to the hon lady constituent and they can take advantage of it the public outcry as result of the itv drama clearly indicate the huge support for our sub postmaster among the public as part of right the wrong of the horizon scandal be it not time to look at the remuneration of current sub postmaster include the option of directly employ they if they so wish as oppose to the independent contracting system we have at the moment so that their income reflect their huge contribution to our community absolutely agree with the hon gentleman that we have to improve the remuneration of sub postmaster and the business they run we want to ensure we have viable network go forward we have branch around the country we have set minimum number of and minimum of of our population have to be within three mile of post office so we have already set access criterion we be keen to ensure that the network be viable go forward the hon gentleman offer one solution to that the government already offer significant financing for the post office about billion over the last year in addition to other financial commitment we have make for other matter such as rebuild the it system we feel that the post office network have bright future particularly in area such as access to cash the banking framework and parcel hub and we see the remuneration opportunity improve in future year on monday ask the minister how we can ensure that any system be the same across the whole of the uk in the past few day before today announcement what discussion have he have with the lord advocate in scotland about the decision have he give any consideration to legislative consent motion so that this parliament could legislate to ensure that the same system be in place across the whole of the uk something the scottish government be reportedly minded to consider if that be not the case and the scottish parliament take different approach how will the minister ensure that the compensation regime be the same across the whole of the uk so that people who may not have their conviction change in scotland in the same way still have access to the same compensation be very keen to make sure it be uk wide scheme both in term of compensation and people access to it we have already have conversation with the scottish administration think they happen yesterday evening so that they fully understand our intention clearly these matter be devolve in scotland so there be different route to make sure that there be one scheme across the uk be keen to continue those conversation and make it as easy as possible for postmaster to overturn conviction or access compensation we all welcome the fact that at long last postmaster can finally expect full justice and restitution for the devastation that they and their family have suffer however do the minister share my concern that notwithstanding restitution and justice for postmaster the post office once most trust brand and institution have be forever and irreparably tarnish by those who preside over this scandal have prosecute and persecute so many decent people who be serve their community do not quite agree with that clearly it have not be the post office fine hour by long chalk but the post office brand itself be revere around the country the reputation of post office ltd the central organisation have be tarnish and we be keen to move on and help the post office to rebuild that relationship it have for example recruit area manager to try to improve its relationship with sub postmaster which think be help but there be work to do to improve the relationship between the centre and the network as constituency mp my experience be that my constituent very much appreciate value and revere the post office in their community thank the minister for some of the detail around today announcement regard the conviction it will come as relief to many as highlight by the itv show the work tirelessly for justice and that of course open the door for so many other but they feel they be be penalise for take this litigation forward with compensation still not be pay to so many as well as other the post office need to be hold responsible for the part it have play in this scandal at every stage include the lie and the blocking of justice yet it be the post office and the government expensive lawyer who be currently litigate every case have to ask whether that be right will the minister look to remove the post office from all the role that it currently play in relation to compensation decision and instead put in place more independent arm length body that will deliver full and fair compensation to all thank the hon member for her work we have engage with she on this issue regularly and she work very hard on behalf of her constituent we be keen to make the compensation available more quickly as announce today her constituent if they be part of the the glo will have access to the fix sum award of which be much quick route but if they go down the full assessment route which they have every right to do we have commit that once claim be submit the dispute resolution process will respond to that claim within day in of case the hon member be wrong to talk about the case be litigate against the process be do by dispute resolution with my department not with the post office if that can not be agree it be send to an independent panel which will then recommend what award should be give the post office be not involve and independence be at the very heart of this process so believe that her constituent will get full and fair outcome but we want to make sure that be do as quickly as possible and we be work on that on daily basis russell ward best from ottery st mary be accuse of steal he avoid prosecution by resign and another sub postmaster represent pay the alleged shortfall to avoid prosecution russell ward best be declare bankrupt and die before he be find innocent and clear will the minister comment on financial redress for all sub postmaster and their family include those who be not prosecute be very sorry to hear what happen to mr ward best his family should be able to get compensation through the historic shortfall scheme that scheme be there to put mr ward best if he be still with we back to where he would have be have this detriment not occur and that can take into account thing such as bankruptcy that money would then be pay to his estate which would then flow through to his family the same compensation be available despite mr ward best very sadly no long be with we one sinister feature of this scandal have be how the post office have try to intimidate and scare people into compliance while research this read that those receive an historic shortfall scheme offer have be erroneously tell by the post office that they be not allow to talk about the term of their compensation the post office have no right to do that but there will be legacy of people who will be scared to talk out about this or cause fuss because they believe that they be not allow to do so can the minister put something on the record to give reassurance to those people who have be deliberately and maliciously mislead by the post office into silence the post office should not be able to do that and those affect should be able to have their story tell and to get justice thank the hon lady for her point be not aware of the particular case to which she refer but it be certainly our position that we want to work closely with people who have be through that scheme the advisory board originally just cover the group litigation order claim we then expand its remit to cover all three scheme so that it could ensure that they provide fair outcome to all those involve we want to give level of consistency across the three scheme the hon lady may want to contact lord arbuthnot or the right hon member for north durham mr jones to discuss her concern be happy to discuss the matter with the advisory board to see what might need to be do we can never right the original wrong or undo all the suffering all we can do be make sure that the misery be not ongoing for those who do not look for grand pardon what right of appeal exist other than request to the criminal cases review commission the hon lady be right to say that no amount of final compensation can ever make good what have happen to many of these people whether it be loss of home loss of business loss of livelihood loss of reputation or loss of life no amount of money can ever compensate for that but we be keen to make sure that wherever we can people do get compensate across all those different area compensation scheme provide for pecuniary and non pecuniary loss which be some of the thing that sadly have happen to people in their personal life that be exactly what we have set out today we be keen to make sure that if people be overturn conviction there be no requirement to go to the ccrc to do that it be something that we can do through legislation in this place and we will be set out exactly how we will deliver that in the come week thank the minister for again come to the house and answer so thoroughly great many question it be very obvious that the house be concerned about this matter point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker jagtar singh johal my constituent be enter his seventh year in arbitrary detention in india in that time he his family and have lose count of the number of foreign secretaries who have run the department have say that in recent week have never see such an utter disregard for what be most likely the most important consular case on the foreign secretary desk yesterday at the foreign affairs committee in response to my hon friend the member for argyll and bute brendan have inform he that would be mention he the foreign secretary seem to intimate willingness to meet and my constituent the family of jagtar singh johal it be clear to that give his response the foreign secretary may not have be aware of my letter date november which seek to have meeting to date have have no formal response although unsurprisingly before prime minister question the family and have hold response from the department which state that reply request meeting with the foreign secretary be be process have no doubt that after two month may eventually get formal response from the foreign secretary give the nature of the case which you have hear raise on many occasion madam deputy speaker and in which there may be death penalty charge you will understand that speed be of the essence be therefore look for clarity on the follow issue be it normal for senior minister of state to take so long to correspond with member of parliament when time be critical do the convention of this house extend to ministers in the other place give that the defence secretary state yesterday that the relationship between the uk and india be not transactional instead both country be natural partner with many commonality and share goal what confidence can and other members of parliament have that the government will represent our constituent hold in india equally in comparison with other finally give that the foreign secretary seem to have intimate that it be no long their intention to attend the foreign affairs committee every six week as be state to the house will mr speaker demand that the foreign secretary be bring to the floor of the house to answer question from member of the house of commons thank the hon gentleman for his point of order as he say we have all hear he raise this matter many time appreciate the urgency of mr jagtar singh johal situation give that the death penalty be possibility the hon gentleman raise some important point that be indeed point for the chair can answer one question quickly and simply mr speaker have say many time that he expect ministers to answer correspondence from member of parliament in timely fashion for the hon gentleman to have go two month without acknowledgment of or answer to his letter be clearly not acceptable the hon gentleman ask about the accountability of minister who be not member of this house that be rather more difficult situation he ask whether mr speaker can in some way summon the foreign secretary to this house under current regulation no he can not but it be normal for ministers who be member of the house of lords to find different way to demonstrate their accountability to the elect representative of the people of course question can be ask in the other place but that be not at all the same as question be ask on behalf of constituent by their member of parliament the hon gentleman mention the foreign affairs committee it be my understanding that the foreign secretary have undertake to appear regularly before that committee that would certainly be way in which ministerial accountability could be demonstrate and undertake the exact status of the situation can not answer for it be not matter for the chair but the hon gentleman have rightly raise important point know that mr speaker will be concern about accountability which be matter for the chair will ensure that he be aware of the point that the hon gentleman have raise and be certain that those on the treasury bench will convey to foreign office ministers the concern that have be express far to that point of order madam deputy speaker too have campaign on behalf of mr johal and too have be dissatisfied with the response of the foreign office over year not just over the last few week in convey the concern of the hon member for west dunbartonshire martin docherty hughes to mr speaker would you also say that they be not confine to he or indeed to the snp they be feel across the house thank the right hon gentleman for clarify the situation it be obvious that the entire house be concern about this matter and about the general matter of accountability will ensure that mr speaker be aware of that far to that point of order madam deputy speaker thank you very much for your response to my initial point of order you raise the fact that it be not yet possible to bring the foreign secretary to the floor of the house would change to standing orders allow the speaker to bring the foreign secretary to this elect chamber to be hold accountable understand the point that the hon gentleman be make which know be of some concern it be not entirely matter for the chair but understand that the procedure committee be consider the whole position of the accountability of ministers who be member of the house of lords be certain that the hon gentleman will make the chair of the procedure committee aware of his concern have every confidence that the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis will also do so as will scottish law officer devolution motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to amend the scotland act to grant to the scottish parliament legislative competence in respect of the role and function of the scottish law officer and for connected purpose my bill be design to give the scottish parliament the power to amend the role of scotland law officer include divide the role of the lord advocate into two separate job one as head of scotland prosecution service and the other as minister of the scottish government and its chief legal adviser the present lord advocate perform both role and both legal scholar and politician be become increasingly concerned that that may give rise to conflict of interest or at the very least perception of conflict of interest wish to stress that no criticism of the current or previous lord advocate or indeed of the current snp government should be infer because the dual role of the lord advocate be historical anachronism that predate devolution the dual role be rubber stamp by the devolution settlement and to date no conservative or labour government have attempt reform believe that reform be long overdue the scottish national party manifesto for the holyrood election promise to consult on separate the role of the lord advocate and the scottish government have commit to review the role of the lord advocate by the end of the current parliament the initial phase of which be to be inform by expert research understand that report on the expert research be to be publish soon however because of reservation in the scotland act it be not open to the scottish parliament to create either new law officer or new public prosecutor that be why my bill be necessary give that both criminal and civil justice be devolve matter it be only right that the scottish parliament should decide how good to reform the role of the lord advocate furthermore it be the scottish parliament that will be furnish with the necessary expert research that have be commission by the scottish government if we be to take at face value assurance from the united kingdom government that they do not wish to undermine the devolution settlement and that they respect the power that have be devolve believe that they should leave it to scotland parliament to carry out the task of reform the role of scotland law officer the lord advocate be the senior of the two scottish law officer the other be the solicitor general the lord advocate be both minister in the scottish government and the holder of historic office the role of lord advocate go back many hundred of year that now have range of function associate with the maintenance of the rule of law and the proper administration of justice the lord advocate be head of the system of criminal prosecution and investigation of death she be also principal legal adviser to the scottish government she represent the scottish government in civil proceeding and the public interest in range of statutory and common law civil and constitutional function the scotland act state that in relation to criminal prosecution and the investigation of death the lord advocate must act independently of other ministers and indeed any other person and believe that the lord advocates have act independently the former first minister the right hon alex salmond take step to underline that independence by depoliticise the appointment process and provide that the law officer should not routinely attend cabinet meeting there be downside to this it deprive the scottish government of the benefit of advice from lawyer who share their political persuasion such advice be previously available to other government and be something from which the uk government benefit the lord advocate be appoint by the king on the recommendation of the first minister with the agreement of the scottish parliament unlike other ministers she can not be remove from office by the first minister without the approval of the parliament the lord advocate have an important role in ensure that legislation pass by the scottish parliament be within its legislative competence and she have power under the scotland act in relation to the resolution of legal question about the devolved power of ministers and the parliament we see that in action recently during the referral to the united kingdom supreme court on the question of whether the scottish parliament have the power to hold second independence referendum accountability to the scottish parliament be an important aspect of the lord advocate constitutional role she may but need not be member of the scottish parliament and if not an msp she be entitle to participate in the proceeding of the parliament but may not vote she can therefore be question by msp about the exercise of her function although she be not require to answer question or produce document in relation to the operation of the criminal prosecution system in specific case there be tension in the principle that the lord advocate should be both independent in her capacity as chief prosecutor but also politically accountable as law officer the venice commission of the council of europe which advise member state on rule of law issue recommend that member state take step to ensure that their state prosecution system be see to act independently of parliament and government for the record think the scottish state prosecution system operate independently of parliament and government but because the two role be hold by the one person there be always the perception that that might not be the case elsewhere in the uk and in the republic of ireland the two role be hold by different people which avoid any possible conflict of interest or the perception of one in england there be an attorney general who be member of the government of the day and quite separately director of public prosecutions who be appoint by public appointment process completely independent of government of course there be the third office of the lord chancellor who perform some constitutional function the expert advise the scottish government might want to think about something akin to that third role for some of the lord advocate function under the scotland act concern about potential conflict in the role of the lord advocate have increase in recent time because of some high profile case include the scottish government handling of complaint against alex salmond the malicious scandal in relation to prosecution over the takeover of rangers football club and the police investigation into snp finance it be important to understand that similar concern have be raise in the past in the early day of the devolved scottish parliament when labour be the government in the wake of the resignation of labour appoint lord advocate there be big debate about the potential conflict of interest prompt by concern around the lockerbie prosecution the grow importance of the european convention on human right under devolution and the lord advocate then role in some judicial appointment there be considerable disquiet back in that the lord advocate be perform the role of politician prosecutor and judge maker since the appointment of judge in scotland have be the responsibility of an independent panel the lord advocate have no involvement in that so her role do not really pose as some people sometimes say problem for the constitutional principle of the separation of power this be not an issue of the separation of power between executive legislature and judiciary because the lord advocate do not have anything to do with the judiciary to come back to present time the report of the scottish parliament inquiry into the scottish government handling of harassment complaint find that event around those issue have show long stand tension in the lord advocate dual role and say that public perception be important it be important that the role of chief prosecutor in any state be free from all suspicion of political interference stress that be not say that there have be political interference want to protect the role from the suspicion that there might be it be also important that scottish government of whatever political hue have the benefit of legal adviser who share their political view while still give independent advice that after all be what the uk government welsh government and irish government enjoy their law officer be usually parliamentarian from the same party as the government of the day as say the scottish government have accept that there be case for separate the two role of the lord advocate be delighted that both the secretary of state for scotland who be in his place and his shadow the hon member for edinburgh south ian murray who explain to why he could not be in his place for this bill agree that there be case for separate the two role my bill have support from the liberal democrats the alba party and distinguished conservative back bencher as well as snp colleague hope that the existence of cross party support mean that this private member bill have chance of become law leave the final decision on the role of scotland law officer where it should be with the scottish parliament question put and agree to order that joanna cherry chris stephens douglas chapman patricia gibson carol monaghan marion fellows ronnie cowan kenny macaskill mr alistair carmichael wendy chamberlain christine jardine and sir david davis present the bill joanna cherry accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday march and to be print bill finance bill programme no motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the order of december finance bill programme be varied as follow in paragraph of that order for thursday january substitute tuesday january largan question agree to finance bill clauses and schedule clause schedule clause and to schedule and new clause relate to those clause and schedule consider in committee dame eleanor laing in the chair clause permanent full expensing etc for expenditure on plant or machinery question propose that the clause stand part of the bill with this it will be convenient to consider the following clause stand part schedule new clause review of relief for research and development the chancellor of the exchequer must within three month of this act be pass publish review of the implementation cost of the measure in section incur by hmrc and business the review under subsection must include detail of the implementation cost of all measure relate to credit or relief for research and development that have be introduce since december this new clause would require the chancellor to publish review set out the total implementation cost of all change to research and development relief in the current parliament new clause assessment of impact of act on business investment and economic growth within six month of the passage of this act the chancellor of the exchequer must carry out an assessment of the impact of section and schedule of this act on business investment and economic growth and lie report of that assessment before both houses of parliament this new clause would require the government to produce an assessment of the impact of the bill new regime for research and development carry out by company this assessment would need to examine the impact on business investment and economic growth this government aim be to grow the economy for the good of everyone by remove barrier to private sector investment and deliver tax system that be supportive of business at the spring budget the chancellor set out his approach for highly competitive tax regime by announce package of generous tax incentive combine with rate of corporation tax that remain the low in the this government have ensure that the uk continue to be one of the good place in the world for business to grow and invest the bill mark our next step in make the uk one of the most competitive tax system among major economy by enhance the support that the corporation tax system provide to business that drive growth by make long term investment it meet the government commitment to introduce permanent full expensing as announce at the autumn statement solidify our international competitiveness and create the certainty that business have tell we they need in order to confidently invest the bill will also drive uk business innovation by merge the exist research and development expenditure credit scheme with the small and medium enterprise scheme merge those scheme will simplify and improve the system for support cutting edge research and development turn first to clause at spring budget the government introduce two new temporary first year capital allowance for qualify expenditure on plant or machinery the first be first year allowance for so call main rate expenditure know as full expensing which allow company to write off the full cost of plant and machinery in the year that the cost be incur the second be first year allowance for expenditure on special rate asset such as lighting system thermal insulation and long life asset allow company to write off half the cost of an asset in the year that it be incur with the remain balance write down at in every year afterwards the chancellor be clear that his long term ambition be to make those new relief permanent once the fiscal and economic condition allow and at the autumn statement he confirm that he be able to do just that clause deliver that ambition make both full expensing and the first year allowance permanent by remove the end date of march that mean that company will be able to permanently benefit from full expensing it solidify our position as joint top of the ranking of oecd country with regard to plant and machinery capital allowance and mean we be the only major economy with permanent full expensing the change will give company the certainty they need to make long term investment and respond to call from the cbi make uk energy uk and other business group and leader and from company include bt openreach siemens and bosch which have say that make the policy permanent would be the single most transformational thing the government could do for business investment and growth accord to the office for budget responsibility it will generate almost billion of additional business investment each year and billion over the course of the next five year the forecast be that gdp will be high by the end of the forecast period and slightly below high in the long term as result applaud the government initiative to make full expensing permanent but of course we know there will be general election within the next month have my hon friend hear from the opposition whether if they be to be in government they would maintain it my hon friend be incredibly knowledgeable about this area through some of his previous business and ministerial experience and that be question be intrigue to hear answer by the opposition shortly believe it be vitally important because the whole point be to give business the confidence to invest in the long term and certainty be key to the investment decision be make far to that point do my hon friend not think as do that it be an aspect of responsible opposition to be clear right now as we be debate this in this house what they would do be they to be in government think my hon friend be kick off what be likely to be long debate over the course of the next year but an important one for our constituent and business the economy will play pivotal part in discussion this year it be very clear what we be do we be implement vital change ask for by business and in response to business to provide that business certainty and an environment in which they and therefore our constituent can thrive do not think any of we want to put that at risk however without the clarification and confidence from the opposition about what they might do these issue will be raise and the uncertainty can persist we on the government side of the house be commit to this and my hon friend be right to make that clear think the minister just read out that the assessment be that this measure will create billion additional investment per year be that right if remember the green book correctly from the autumn statement the annual cost of this measure be billion which think equate to billion of extra capital expenditure be he say that billion of that billion be just bring forward investment that would have happen later and billion be new or have somehow get my number wrong and this will generate load of investment that would not otherwise have happen my hon friend be right to point out the timing element with both full expensing and will come on to in moment because think that be the billion figure he mention but these measure particularly the full expensing will of course have long term impact over long period of time the cost be up front but the benefit be over long period and anyone who have work in business understand that he be right to point out the anomaly and it be very important point because lot of people probably would not understand it but the fact that the obr have highlight the incremental impact on the economy overall show that there be clear and transparent net benefit the timing of the impact change but we be talk about additional investment right away because we will be give business the confidence to be able to make those decision and invest immediately appreciate the minister comment so far can he confirm how many time policy have change in this important area since while he be make some further point today it seem that government policy have change quite erratically and that in itself be difficult for business to respond to when they be look for certainty in plan for the long term agree that certainty for business be pivotal but with both full expensing and the government the chancellor and other have be indicate the direction of travel for some time and therefore give increase certainty as have say it be mention while ago that we intend to pursue the policy of full expensing when the economic circumstance allow and now they do which will come to in minute have be discuss for quite long time and be the result of extensive co operation with industry it be also the reality though that government policy need to change in response to the nature of change economy and to thing such as digital the cloud and so on when it come to other investment we need to make sure that new and emerge policy area be cover as well we have see today as we see in the autumn statement very clear direction of travel from the conservative side of the chamber which be about incentivise business and cut taxis permanent full expensing also simplify the capital allowance regime overall as company can claim the full cost in year one reduce the need to claim writing down allowance year on year turn to clause and schedule the government have also announce the closure of the tax relief review launch in the point be just make to the hon member for reading east matt rodda alongside set of change to simplify and improve the system clause make change to merge the current expenditure credit and sme scheme for expenditure in accounting period begin on or after april simplify the system and provide great support for uk company to drive innovation the merged scheme will have an above the line mechanism similar to the expenditure credit with rate of that will make the benefit more visible and easy for company to factor into their investment decision additionally small and medium enterprise lossmaker will now be able to carry forward their loss rather than have to surrender they which will give total benefit of up to per of expenditure there will also be reduction in the rate at which the merged scheme credit be tax for lossmaker from to that be worth around million per annum to non intensive lossmaker and will increase the up front cash benefit for lossmaker subcontracting rule in the merged scheme will allow the company take the decision to do to claim relief on contract out that approach be base on the current sme scheme which be identify as the good option in the consultation we deliver and have be refine far follow engagement with industry last summer subsidy rule will also be remove allow sme to claim relief for work for which they receive grant of subsidy this represent an increase in generosity for sme as well as be major tax simplification the government be also legislate for enhanced support for loss make intensive sme that be announce at spring budget and will benefit sme year by provide further support to the most intensive sme while merge the current scheme the government be promote the condition for enterprise to succeed company claim the exist sme tax relief will be eligible for high payable credit rate of if they meet the definition for intensity at the summer statement the government announce several improvement be make to that enhance support the intensity threshold be be lower to from from april mean that around more company will benefit from the support one year grace period be be introduce provide great certainty by ensure that company that dip under the threshold will continue receive relief for one year the same subcontracting rule as the merged scheme will apply to this enhance support far help to simplify the system with one set of rule that both sme and large company will follow overall relief will support an estimate billion of business expenditure in increase from billion in expenditure on relief be forecast to increase in every year of the scorecard period we will also restrict nomination and assignment for relief payment that measure ensure that genuine business get the payment for their claim directly rather than receive it through an agent and be design to benefit genuine claimant and reduce non compliance subject to limited exception no tax credit payment will be make to nominee bank account and any tax credit payment must be pay directly to the company that claim for the so claimant will now receive their payment directly give they more control that will ensure that the person claim the relief have well oversight of the claim and receive the money into their account quick claimant will also be clear on exactly how much money be be charge by their agent rather than just receive net amount after fee have be deduct that build on previously announce measure and policy change to help to ensure great company control over claim the government be commit to make the uk the good place in the world to do business full expensing and tax relief support business to grow and invest which will boost productivity and economic growth that remain the key way to raise everybody living standard and to fund high quality public service throughout the uk commend clause and and schedule to the committee let start by briefly consider the context in which we be debate clause and as we know the bill follow the chancellor statement on november last year in which he claim that he be deliver an autumn statement for growth as the committee may remember the office for budget responsibility confirm on the same day that growth forecast have be cut by more than half for the come year cut again for the year after that and cut yet again for the year after that independent analyst confirm that even after all the change the government have announce personal taxis would still rise in fact personal taxis be now set to rise by per household by with the tax burden on track to be the high since the second world war despite people across the country pay so much in tax public service be collapse the nhs be on its knee and more and more family be struggle to make end meet that be the context in which we consider the bill on second reading just before christmas year of conservative economic failure have leave people across britain bad off the only thing to have change since then be that we now face year of conservative economic failure it may be new year but those in the govern party face the same cold truth nothing they can say or do now can repair the damage that they have do to our economy people in business across britain deserve so much well as foundation of well management of the economy our country need and deserve stability certainty and long term plan it be for that reason that although we welcome the fact that clause make full expensing permanent which we have long call for it simply can not make up for the year of uncertainty that business have face business need stability and predictability to help they plan for growth and their long term planning have be hold back because the government have be chop and change business taxis and relief year after year with no evidence of anything resemble long term strategy be very pleased to hear the shadow minister say that the opposition welcome the full expensing that help but maybe he can go far to clarify in new clause table in his name the opposition be call for review of all business taxis and relief which would include full expensing he will know as will the hon member for mid bedfordshire alistair strathern who be sit behind he that there be particular potential investment decision in our county will the shadow minister make it explicit that the labour party intention be to include in its manifesto for the next election commitment to maintain full expensing as have say we have long be call for full expensing and we welcome the fact that it be be make permanent do not mean to sound jokey in my response be deadly serious when say this but if the hon gentleman want to know what labour government would do if we get into office there be one way to see that eventuality come about we could have general election soon rather than later instead of drag thing on throughout the course of frankly the country need to move on from the current government just look at their record on capital allowance since the last general election the hon member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller speak about certainty and the need for stability but let we look at the change that have happen to capital allowance over the past four or five year as mention on second reading back at the beginning of this parliament the annual investment have be raise to million on temporary basis that temporary basis be extend by the finance act extend again by the finance act and then make permanent by the finance no act meanwhile over the course of this parliament the super deduction come and go entirely last year full expensing for expenditure on plant or machinery be introduce but only on temporary basis for three year now of course treasury ministers be amend what their predecessor announce last year by make full expensing permanent although we welcome that policy wonder how long it will last frankly wonder how long any policy can be expect to last under this government when they be lead in the loose possible sense of that word by such weak prime minister if we accept clause at face value we welcome its principle of make full expensing permanent as that be something that we have long call for will focus the rest of my question on some of the specific of the government approach as ever be grateful to the excellent team at the chartered institute of taxation for all their thought on the detail of what the government have propose in this clause and other know that one matter of interest to the chartered institute be the fact that at the autumn statement the government say that they would publish technical consultation on lease asset would be grateful if the minister tell we when that will be publish furthermore both the chartered institute of taxation and the association of taxation technicians to which be also grateful for its thought on the detail of the bill have query which company and asset be eligible for full expensing would be grateful if the minister clarify which asset be outside the scope of full expensing and whether the treasury will publish detailed list of what do and do not count as plant and machinery would also be grateful if he tell we how many firm will not be eligible for full expensing because they be partnership know that many who take an interest in this matter would welcome clarity on that in clause the government propose change to the system of tax credit for research and development as with their approach to business taxation and capital allowance the government have fail to deliver any sense of stability when it come to tax credit despite certainty and predictability be so crucial to business that be make investment decision that much be clear when look at the list of change that we have debate in finance bills over the course of the current parliament alone the finance act change the rate of expenditure credit the finance act change how much tax relief small and medium sized enterprise could claim the finance act again change the rate of tax relief the finance no act change far how the relief operate and now the finance bill before we change the system of relief yet again we accept of course that some change be necessary and important to enable legislation to function well but that do not seem to be what we have see what we have see be government incapable of provide stability predictability and the long term plan that business need to invest and grow it be clear that after year in office the conservatives be incapable of provide that crucial foundation for our economic success my hon friend be make an excellent point which come to the nub of the argument the government be not capable of provide business with the certainty it need that be such tragedy because so many wonderful emerge industry in the uk which have incredible potential need that certainty as indeed do other business my hon friend be absolutely right so many business in the uk that be keen to invest grow and make people across britain well off be be hold back by the lack of stability and certainty from this government can not help but notice that the government recognise the symptom of the problem that lack of stability and certainty be indeed problem for economic growth but they be simply unable to provide response to that problem and provide the long term plan that britain so desperately need we know that so much chop and change without any clear long term plan have have cost for our economy by undermine prospect for investment innovation and growth indeed the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales have share with we the view of its member that there be lack of confidence when claim tax relief within the uk and their belief that this have arise due to the various change make to the rule in quick succession over the past few year we also know of course that have so many change one after the other have direct impact on taxpayer as well as business as the public finance bear the cost for all the impact on his majesty revenue and customs in term of it system and staffing our analysis of hmrc policy paper suggest that the change make and propose within the current parliament have have cumulative impact on operational cost for hmrc of more than million that sum be likely to include substantial waste of taxpayer money as result of so many piecemeal change rather than coherent and lasting reform in order to be clear and transparent on the cost of all the government change to tax credit we have table new clause the new clause would require the chancellor to publish review set out the total implementation cost of all change to research and development relief in the current parliament hope ministers will accept that straightforward new clause but if not look forward to government members who would be interested in such transparency join we in support it furthermore if ministers be not prepared to vote for the new clause or accept it would be grateful if they could at least commit to write to with the figure that our new clause request turn to the substantive impact of clause we should be clear about what the clause do in the autumn statement the chancellor say that the government be create new simplified tax relief that combine the exist expenditure credit and small and medium sized enterprise scheme official report november vol we have hear similar word from the minister in this debate in reality though the government plan still effectively maintain two separate scheme although they seek to merge the two exist scheme they continue to provide additional support for intensive sme through the exist sme scheme rather than its form part of the new merged scheme although we recognise that intensive sme may need extra support the chartered institute of taxation have point out that the government plan be less merger than the shifting of most sme into revise scheme base on an rdec approach with the sme scheme remain for small group of intensive sme the association of taxation technicians have point out the impact this may have say that the introduction of new rule to define intensive sme and the possibility of company move in and out of the two regime as their expenditure profile change will arguably result in an overall increase in the complexity of the relief regime rather than simplification as say we recognise that intensive sme may need additional support but would be grateful if the minister could explain why the government have choose to continue operate separate scheme to provide that support rather than deliver it as part of the new merged scheme alongside understand the government intention regard the design of the new regime would also like to question the minister about the timescale for implement the measure in clause in the policy document associate with the autumn statement it be clear that the new regime would apply from april onward in the bill however schedule which clause introduce make clear that the change will apply from an appoint day to be appoint by the treasury in regulation would be grateful if the minister could confirm in his reply what that appoint day will be be it april or will it be later date as april be less than three month away if the appoint day do indeed fall within that month be the minister confident that that leave enough time for proper consultation and for any new system and process to be put in place by business agent software provider and hmrc if instead the appoint day be later than april those affect need to know what be happen hope the minister will be able to provide clarity on that question today otherwise sadly this seem to be yet another example of continue uncertainty for business from this government finally we know that the government be concerned about the level of non compliance with the tax credit scheme in their policy paper publish in november about the merging of the current scheme they write further action may be need to reduce the unacceptably high level of non compliance in the relief and hmrc will be publish compliance action plan in due course tackle non compliance be of course very important so would be grateful if the minister could confirm in his reply when hmrc will be publish the promise compliance action plan be also very aware from meeting have have with small business that they often face great deal of confusion over the guideline associate with tax credit whereas large business will typically have the resource and institutional capacity to navigate those rule be concerned that small business often do not and may find themselves have to pay for expensive consultant to help they understand they hmrc could have role to play in support small firm with clarity about the guideline on tax credit as well as of course in its role in tackle genuine fraud indeed the startup coalition an organisation that advocate for policy to support innovative firm in the uk have highlight the need for hmrc to improve and have call for improved transparency around adjudicate whether activity be to provide certainty for firm the icaew have make similar point stress the need for guidance and education and make clear that the new rule will significantly affect all size of company include those small entity with limited professional tax resource therefore urge the minister to make sure that any plan for improve compliance with the rule also focus on make the rule easy to comply with wherever possible and on work with small innovative firm to help give they the certainty they need to thrive to conclude labour will not be oppose either of the clause but urge treasury ministers to accept our new clause and when they reply to respond to the specific point that have raise more widely it be clear from their approach to capital allowance and tax relief that the conservatives be incapable of provide stability and long term approach their failure be let down business across our country who stand ready to play their part in grow the economy and make people across britain well off be delighted to be able to speak in committee on the finance bill which believe emphasise the conservative principle of encourage entrepreneur free enterprise and innovation many in this chamber will know that do not have traditional finance background but do run my own business for year which think qualify to identify when fiscal measure be really go to help business that be what see in the bill especially clause and which will speak to today first will take the opportunity to speak in favour of clause which will support uk business by make full expensing permanent in the spring budget the chancellor introduce major reform to the system of capital allowance by replace the super deduction system with three year of full expensing the new measure which be initially put in place until april allow company to claim the full cost of their expenditure on plant or machinery against tax when the business investment be make that measure be well receive by business across the uk as my hon friend the minister have already state he quote number of large plcs but the measure have also allow number of erewash base business to benefit and prosper dales fabrications ltd previously claim super deduction the predecessor of full expensing on very significant piece of machinery it sound quite complicated to but it be metre press break with lot of bespoke option the benefit of the super deduction be of such significance that the business purchase additional and highly beneficial tooling concurrently with the machine the now chairman of the business say to in reality we would have inevitably defer that additional tooling purchase without the super deduction thus mean we would have have per cent of the benefit of our new machinery from day one and would have be effectively deny access to some type of work that go beyond typical industry standard size the owner of another business millitec say super deduction be really good and real incentive for we to invest the successor of the super deduction which mean be able to expense fully the cost of plant and machinery on permanent basis as propose in clause will undoubtedly continue to be huge incentive for business across the uk to invest in their future and in uk plc know from speak to my local business that they really welcome this and see it as one way to be able to expand and grow their business however have question for my hon friend the minister the terminology of plant and machinery be very broad so when he respond could he provide some clarity for my erewash business about what be define as plant and machinery to help they understand what be in scope for example do it extend to it equipment think that have well understanding of the terminology will really help business of all size to take full advantage of what be on offer the content of clause show that the government be on the side of business ahead of the autumn statement last year business include astrazeneca which be so instrumental in the covid vaccine out and toyota major employer of many of my constituent write joint letter to my right hon friend the chancellor ask for the april expiry date to be remove so make full expensing permanent today by support clause and make full expensing permanent we be back business and help they to succeed it also show that the government be listen to business and make sure they be put in place measure that will really help they grow their business clause will provide business with the big tax cut in modern history worth over billion year make the uk capital allowance regime one of the most generous in the world since the introduction of temporary full expensing in april the uk have become an appeal place to invest the uk have have the second high investment growth in the and three time that of the us make full expense permanent can only perpetuate that growth will my hon friend say when he wind up whether plan be in place to extend full expensing to plant and machinery that be either lease or hire those two option be often the only affordable one for business with big ambition but limited capital let turn to clause and schedule the bill will simplify research and development rule by merge the small and medium sized enterprise and the expenditure credit scheme whether it be trialle and distribute the successful covid vaccine which help we defeat or test and develop new innovation that will enable we to meet our net zero target business play vital role in grow our economy at the spring budget my right hon friend the chancellor announce enhanced support for intensive sme worth around million per year consultation on the potential merged tax relief scheme and support for those loss make business as result the measure in this bill show the government unwavere support for business specifically clause and schedule will help reduce bureaucracy and ensure that taxpayer money be spend as effectively as possible by simplify the tax system that will stop many business have to navigate the complex transition between the two exist scheme it be anticipate that the reduction of the intensity threshold in the intensive business scheme from to from april this year will allow around extra sme to qualify for an enhance rate of relief one year grace period will also be introduce provide certainty for company dip under the threshold that they will continue to receive relief for one year this be vital measure for so many focus business which inherently have peak and trough of activity take together these change will provide million worth of additional relief per year by to help drive innovation in the uk as former biomedical scientist and someone who continue to take keen interest in the area know that the measure in clause and schedule will undoubtedly benefit the bioscience sector the government be adopt an interesting position on subcontracting the bill will allow the decision maker to claim for subcontracted work will the minister confirm that propose new section will mean that if company be contract to do work that be not research and development but then decide to carry out some related work it will be entitle to claim relief for it will he also confirm that the new measure will allow business that contract out to research organisation qualifying activity such as clinical trial to claim for the cost of the contract if this be the case be sure that subcontracting will increase collaboration and knowledge sharing which be crucial for economic growth have no doubt that the measure announce in the bill will be the ignition that accelerate the uk economy and lead we to bright future will support the bill throughout today call the snp spokesperson be only go to make some brief remark on the two clause the uk government be clearly scramble to fix an economic mess of their own making and the bill be full of such measure on clause during the autumn statement welcome this move but it do little to deal with the damage to business that have be cause by the big grey elephant in the room that none of the party wish to mention which be brexit far from the ideal of remove red tape and decrease bureaucracy as we have hear throw about in this chamber it have actually lead to more red tape and more difficulty for business this be just one of the measure the government should be take among many other they must consider in future hope to come to those later in the debate the year of uncertainty that the hon member for ealing north james murray mention have indeed be year of uncertainty cause by this government but they have definitely be impact by the brexit that labour now support along with the liberal democrats people be struggle with cost of living crisis and it be affect domestic sale too so they need other fix again will have some question about that later clause and schedule hope this will be helpful for the minister be like try to make jigsaw puzzle with no box no picture and just some random bit and piece to try to plug together to make something out of productivity do not work without the skill require in research and development we do not get the advance or the boost we need without that and once again the spectre of brexit mean that we have skill shortage across the nation of the uk that be particularly affect scotland which need its own immigration rule it be something we would ask to have power over short of our call it would of course be the absolute good result for scotland to have independence so it can make these decision itself it be pleasure to speak in this debate want to direct my remark to clause on permanent full expensing for the purchase of plant and machinery which discuss during the autumn statement and on second reading this be actually quite radical and expensive policy we have probably for long than all our lifetime give company relief for capital expenditure use capital allowance that be originally quite generous in the first year suspect that most plant and machinery have long life than that when the rule be produce we have choose to do that for all these year rather than just let business deduct its own accounting calculation of depreciation because we do not want the manipulation of tax deduction by business do their tax return we choose to do it this way the tool that government of all colour for decade have have when the economy hit trouble be to give first year allowance and various enhancement remember first year allowance and first year allowance we have have full expensing up to million as the shadow minister refer to that have be the way of incentivise investment in period of economic recovery for probably as long back as there have be toolkit now we have land on permanent full expensing so business get full relief on plant and machinery spend in the first year what be the government expect to happen differently here be we expect capital investment by business of more than million year that otherwise would not be economically viable and would never have happen be we expect investment to be bring forward and to take place early than it otherwise would have that would be entirely welcome and would probably modernise business protect job and give they chance to grow in way that they perhaps would not have have which be not bad policy aim at all or be we just give business an early tax relief than they otherwise would have have whereby they bank that and be happy but it do not change behaviour it be hard to get behind the number on this measure in the green book as say early the estimate at the end of the five year period and probably the first full year that make this permanent will make difference be tax cost of billion just for this measure if we run the number bear in mind that business will already have have tax relief on that same expenditure in that year that mean we expect billion high claim to get tax relief in that financial year than otherwise would have happen however the minister say that only billion of that be estimate by the obr to be additional investment that would not otherwise have take place at some point it suggest that we have lot of investment be bring forward with lot of more generous tax relief that would have happen anyway will the minister explain what the government be aim to achieve and what be be forecast be the obr be unduly cautious that would enable we to understand how we judge whether the measure have be successful be we expect to see whole load of investment in plant and machinery that never would have be viable before or be we expect to see it bring forward if what we be get be bring forward at some time the cost should start to taper down because this be not new tax relief that business would not have already have it be just an acceleration of tax relief and business will pay more tax in all subsequent year because they be not get the relief they use to get the measure could cost billion in the first year and gradually that would level down and in the fullness of time there would be no more annual cost in effect can the minister clarify that it be not immediately clear how the government plan to assess whether the measure have work or be work assume that from electronic corporate tax return we can track down to the pound the amount of investment claim for full expense relief every year we could have report within six month of the end of calendar year on how much of these allowance have be claim and compare that with the total amount claim for capital allowance in whichever precede year we like we could see whether full expensing be drive behaviour change will the minister talk we through what he expect to happen and how he will assess whether this have be an effective way of boost productivity and increase investment for billion year it be probably one of the most sizeable line entry we have see in finance bill in my year here normally we expect the big number to be tax cut for individual and this measure be significant as we be make this measure permanent feature of our tax system it shin light on what we be try to get from our corporation tax system there will not be any kind of compliance saving the minister make brave attempt at say there might but effectively all that will change be that the number that business currently put in its addition to its writing down allowance pool will now be put in the first year claim box it be the same number in different box that be the only compliance change we have here it throw into question some previous policy decision we have make because for business to get full benefit from this it need to be pay enough tax to use the full relief in that first year if business can not use the full relief the incentive be not as powerful as they would otherwise be because then the option be effectively to carry that excess deduction forward but we introduce rule few year ago that be strict on how many loss business can use in year if we really think that give people the early possible cash tax benefit for capital investment drive investment we should probably take away that restriction on use loss so that business can get the benefit as early as possible and not have it spread over number of year go forward will the minister explain whether the government will look at that and make sure we be not accidentally undo some of the benefit we be seek to get my second question be what do we do with the legacy write down allowance pool that relate to plant and machinery expenditure for god know how many past year on reduce balance basis of it take many many year to get full tax relief for expenditure so every business will have large pot of money that it have not yet have tax benefit for be we expect they to run that down at reduce balance year and still be do so in year time by which point no one will have any idea what on earth that balance ever be or should we say that be bit of nonsense why do we not just let you take the whole balance at year over the next five year and finish that problem off because we do not need to be focus on that we could find any number we like there but it would draw line under that past expenditure in way that genuinely simplify thing we then have the question of what do we do with capital expenditure on item that be not plant and machinery the tax relief we give on structure and building be not generous but if we be try to drive an increase in productivity and large business to invest in new gigafactorie to build battery for electric car or for electricity storage or whatever do we not want to incentivise they to build the factory building as well rather than either give they no relief or give it over long time if we be spend billion year to encourage investment in plant and machinery should we not spend little money on try to encourage other thing that be key for industrial investment to take place by be bit more generous on building and structure have the minister any thought on that the government do capital allowance review only year or two ago which do not look at permanent full expensing as one of the option but it would be interesting to see whether they have have any further thought on that we be now ask every business to go through and track every item of capital that they spend and treat it differently in their tax return from how they treat it in their accounting record then we have all manner of different law depend on whether it be long life asset short life asset car or an environmentally friendly car could go on for the amount now at stake and give that we have give full relief for plant and machinery which be the big amount do we really need all that cost and complexity or should we just say for all those other item you can just have your accounting calculation okay business might take it bit quick than we would like but in actual fact the cost of that be not all that material in the grand scheme of thing we could move to system where the only adjustment someone have to make to their tax return be to claim very generous tax relief on plant and machinery and they would not have to touch anything else that would be more coherent corporation tax regime now that we have spend all this money incentivise plant and machinery it would then genuinely be compliance save for business in that situation support the measure and truly hope that it work but as significant amount be be spend it would be helpful to understand what we be try to achieve and how we will know whether we have be successful hope that the government will move on to think about how we can slightly recast our tax system so that it make sense have make this radical and generous change thank hon member for their contribution will take few moment to respond to quite few question raise during the debate first reassure hon member that further guidance will be provide on these scheme of course we do not want all the scheme just to exist we want they to be use so that they have real world impact more information will therefore be come out about variety of area over period of time gently remind the hon member for ealing north james murray who yet again take the opportunity to talk the uk economy down the opposition always do that every single labour government have end with unemployment high than what they inherit from the conservatives think the public be well aware of that pattern turn to the many question raise thank my hon friend the members for amber valley nigel mills and for erewash maggie throup and indeed opposition members for their contribution on timing the government have be clear since the merged scheme consultation be publish in january last year that the intend implementation date for the scheme be april importantly in response to that consultation and in recognition of comment the merged scheme will apply to accounting period start on or after april rather than to expenditure incur from that date again we will provide further guidance on that on leasing and hiring which be raise by my hon friend the member for erewash and the hon member for ealing north the government commit at the spring budget to engage with stakeholder with view to extend the scope of expense to include asset for leasing and hiring as the autumn statement confirm that will continue to be consider we will launch technical consultation on draft legislation shortly in early several hon member ask about the perfectly valid and important point of what specifically will be include have whole list of what be define as plant and machinery as say reassure hon member that further guidance will be provide it include thing such as computer printer office equipment vehicle van lorry tractor forklift truck tool ladder and drill and equipment such as excavator compactor bulldozer and so on that be quite comprehensive list but more information will be provide my hon friend the member for amber valley raise an important point about building of course while they be not include in full expensing business can instead receive relief through the separate structure and building allowance that the government introduce in on fraud which be raise by the hon member for ealing north over the last three year hmrc have significantly increase the number of people work on compliance to over we have also announce policy measure to counter non compliance in scheme and will follow up with more detailed compliance action plan outline of how hmrc will reduce error and fraud that will be release in due course follow on from the comment of the hon member for amber valley nigel mills about the impact of the scheme and give the federation of small businesses request for some publication about the impact of these tax relief on level will the minister also publish report on their impact on different region and subregion all taxis be keep under review as be their impact so some of the call for further analysis be not necessary because we do that as matter of course it be important to stress that many external study have find that when full expensing have be introduce in other country it have be very effective in support investment of course the obr forecast predict boost of billion each year the analysis of the impact of the super deduction be already take place but company have month from the end of their accounting period to amend their tax return so hmrc will not have complete datum on the impact of the super deduction until however we will provide further analysis in due course my hon friend the member for erewash mention whole range of real world impact from these measure and the previous measure include the super deduction as well as importantly the annual investment allowance of million which affect the of small business that can effectively benefit from full expensing in the autumn statement we announce full expensing for large business the top who conduct about of full investment be aware of time but will cover couple of other key point that be raise my hon friend the member for erewash raise subcontracting again we engage extensively with stakeholder on this issue over the summer and the government have develop an approach that will allow the person take the decision to do to claim that relief that be the preferred result of the consultation however an exception will apply in the important area that she mention of company do such as in clinical trial in the uk for another company that be ineligible for relief because for example it be an overseas customer that be to make sure that the impact be there for everyone to benefit from the hon member for ealing north also mention partnership corporate partner be eligible for full expensing but an unincorporated partner be not again the annual investment allowance of million cover the investment need of almost all unincorporated partnership the hon member keep harp on about taxis rise strongly advise he to look at his december payslip and compare it to the one he will get shortly maybe he will have the decency to come to and tell whether his tax be low or high each fiscal event need to be take separately at the last one the autumn statement we cut taxis national insurance be down interruption if the hon member do not believe pose this challenge to he if his payslip show that his taxis be low perhaps he will do the courtesy of come to and apologise or give the difference to charity to put his money where his mouth be we do not believe that new clause be necessary because the information have already be publish in the tax impact and information note alongside each change which give clear explanation of the policy objective along with detail of the implementation cost for both hmrc and business therefore the new clause be not necessary urge the house to reject it and commend clause and and schedule to the committee question put and agree to clause accordingly order to stand part of the bill clause order to stand part of the bill schedule agree to new clause review of relief for research and development the chancellor of the exchequer must within three month of this act be pass publish review of the implementation cost of the measure in section incur by hmrc and business the review under subsection must include detail of the implementation cost of all measure relate to credit or relief for research and development that have be introduce since december murray bring up and

set out staffing arrangement within hmrc customer compliance group for undertake enforcement work relate to section to and schedule of this act this new clause would require the government to produce an assessment of the impact of the bill tax evasion and avoidance measure the assessment would need to examine whether the capacity and ability of hmrc be sufficient to properly enforce those measure new clause review of effectiveness of section measure in prevent fraud involve taxpayer money the chancellor of the exchequer must within three month of this act be pass conduct review of the effectiveness of the provision of section in prevent fraud involve taxpayer money the review must evaluate the effectiveness of the provision of section in prevent fraud involve taxpayer money through comparison with the effectiveness of other measure that seek to prevent fraud involve taxpayer money and the approach take in other country this new clause would require the chancellor to review the effectiveness of measure in this act to prevent fraud involve taxpayer money and to compare they with other measure that seek to prevent fraud involve taxpayer money and the approach take in other country clause and to and schedule and cover technical change to pillar of the international tax agreement double the maximum sentence for the most egregious form of tax fraud the introduction of new power to tackle the promotion of tax avoidance and action against fraud in the construction industry scheme the uk tax gap be currently at an all time low at of total tax liability that be due to strong government action to tackle all form of non compliance in the tax system but we be never complacent that be why we have introduce more than measure since include since to reduce the tax gap even far the government be take action to ensure that individual and company pay the taxis that be due in the uk we want to deter individual from commit fraud in the first place that be why we be double the maximum sentence for tax fraud the government be also take action against tax avoidance by introduce new criminal offence of the promotion of tax avoidance and by expedite the disqualification of director of company that promote tax avoidance the measure be design to protect tax revenue which be important for fund our vital public service it be also important to protect tax revenue from company shift profit offshore that be why the uk implement pillar on december we be update exist legislation with technical amendment today to ensure that uk legislation be consistent with newly agree guidance to address further stakeholder comment to clarify term and to avoid unintended consequence clause strengthen our enforcement power when it come to tax offence it double the maximum prison term from seven year to year for individual convict of the most egregious case of tax fraud this apply to all taxis and duty administer by hmrc it also increase the maximum penalty for counterfeit from year to year these measure demonstrate hope the government intent to crack down on tax fraud and to deter criminal action that damage the public purse clause and and schedule seek to target the promotion of tax avoidance in order to protect taxpayer and reduce the damage inflict on the public finance recent power such as hmrc power to name promoter and their scheme and its power to issue stop notice be effectively disrupt promoter activity none the less small number of promoter persist in attempt to sidestep the rule so clause and schedule enable hmrc to act swiftly to seek the disqualification of director and other individual who control or exercise influence over company involve in the promotion of tax avoidance they enable the removal of those individual from the avoidance market and will deter other from become director of company that promote avoidance in the finance act the government introduce rule that allow hmrc to issue stop notice that require promoter to stop promote specify tax avoidance scheme stop notice be an important deterrent tool as fail to comply with stop notice can lead to substantial civil penalty clause increase the consequence of fail to comply by introduce new criminal offence which will apply to promoter who continue to promote an avoidance scheme after receive stop notice create criminal offence signal the severity of this issue and reinforce the importance of comply with stop notice finally clause tackle serious non compliance in the construction industry the construction industry scheme require contractor to withhold tax unless subcontractor hold gross payment status most gross payment status holder be legitimate and compliant construction business but in recent year gross payment status have be use by organise crime organisation to facilitate fraud this allow unscrupulous actor to compete unfairly against legitimate business clause therefore strengthen the test for gross payment status by add vat to the taxis with which subcontractor must demonstrate compliance this measure be predict to raise around million over the next five year each of these clause help to protect vital tax revenue use to fund our public service they seek to deter taxpayer from knowingly defraud the government and encourage they to act against the promotion of tax avoidance therefore ask that clause clause to and schedule and stand part of the bill call the shadow minister rise to speak to the new clause in my name and that my hon friend the member for hampstead and kilburn tulip siddiq clause and schedule relate to the implementation of pillar of the oecd inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting labour support this clause and schedule as they be intend to modify the exist multinational and domestic top up taxis introduce in the finance no act to make sure these new taxis work as intend we have long support the global deal on the taxation of large multinational as we want to see it work as effectively as possible we know that the oecd guidance on implement the deal be come out in tranche so it be important that uk legislation be update to reflect that we recognise that as with any global deal of this scale its detail be complicated and its implementation will take time yet we have be clear throughout its development that we support the principle of global agreement as crucial step in make the tax system fairer thereby help to make sure that british business that pay their fair share of taxis be not undermine indeed nearly three year ago in april first set out in the commons our support for global deal to make that tax system fairer to make sure that level playing field be there for british business and to stop the international race to the bottom on tax for large multinational the treasury ministers at the time appear at first lukewarm in back plan emerge from the united states for global deal eventually however the then chancellor now the prime minister begin to support the deal in public we be glad that the current prime minister seem to have come round but be not sure all his back benchers have for instance wonder whether the hon member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller would agree with the prime minister when he say we now have clear path to fair tax system where large global player pay their fair share wherever they do business we agree with the prime minister on that point but just wonder whether everyone on the conservative benches do be read some of their face and think the answer be clear could it be that the prime minister lack support from prominent back benchers within his own party on policy he be now champion surely not but treasury ministers should rest assure that if their back benchers pull any trick on clause they will have our support for it to pass of course clause relate to pillar of the oecd deal which seek to make sure that large multinational pay minimum rate of corporate tax in every country in which they operate there be of course also pillar which involve partially reallocate tax right over the profit of large multinational to the jurisdiction where consumer be locate we know that the implementation of pillar be go ahead as this bill make clear but pillar appear to have slow so would be grateful if the minister provide an update to the house of progress toward the implementation of pillar we know for instance that there be still work to be do to reach the necessary agreement between all major economy so perhaps he would confirm whether the government be still commit to pillar be implement if so what step have he take since take up his role to help make that happen clause relate to make sure that large multinational pay their fair share of taxis but clause to deal with wide question of tax avoidance and evasion we believe the government should make sure that there be always tough prison term and powerful deterrent for those who commit fraudulent tax evasion and other serious tax offence and that those punishment should be well publicise and effectively enforce likewise labour believe there be strong case for tough punishment for those who commit fraud against public service government and the public purse other country have strong law and sanction than the uk have for such offence which mean that judge can hand down tough punishment to criminal who have rip off the taxpayer such as by wilfully defraud the country through public contract or business support our new clause would require the government to be open and honest about what they be do to prevent fraud involve taxpayer money in term of the measure in this bill other measure more widely and in comparison with the practice overseas those who defraud the taxpayer be steal from the country and it weaken our public service we want to see fraudster and organise crime gang meet with the full force of the law as country we should have the most effective possible measure in place to prevent fraud involve taxpayer money our amendment today will be the first step in make sure that that be the case and urge all mp to join we in vote for it in the legislation before we we see the conservatives try to act tough by raise the maximum prison term for tax offence from seven to year but the government own figure reveal that average sentence for tax fraud be just two year once again they can not hide from their record they have fail to take tax fraud seriously and any change they make after year in office be far too little far too late it be clear from an hmrc report look at the approach take by its fraud investigation service towards tax compliance and serious fraud in that the average length of custodial sentencing be month we believe that the public deserve more information on how sentencing be work under the current government so our new clause require datum to be publish set out the average sentence and the range of sentence hand down in each of the last five year for the offence that clause apply to urge ministers to accept our new clause but if they be not willing to do so will they write to with detail of all the information that it request whatever that datum may show it seem clear from the datum that be already available that under the conservatives sentence appear to be nowhere near the exist seven year maximum and so year seem even more distant prospect whatever the government may say about sentencing our court system be already hamstring by be neglect and face the high backlog on case in the crown court and over in the magistrate court we will not oppose clause but this debate have make clear the depth of the conservatives failure on law and order and just what mess they have create clause and schedule would enable hmrc to bring disqualification action against director of company involve in promote tax avoidance we support the principle behind the clause and will not oppose it however as the chartered institute of taxation and in particular the low incomes tax reform group have helpfully point out there be question about make sure these power be target and use correctly these question arise because of case where the true promoter of tax avoidance scheme recruit other often vulnerable or naive individual to be director of the company involve thereby shield themselves from any action to be effective the legislation need to respond to that situation on the one hand the law need to be able to pursue those ultimately responsible whether they be formal director or not on the other hand there need to be degree of discretion about the punishment of those recruit to be sham director when they may be vulnerable people on the first of those point understand that the government be aware that those ultimately behind an avoidance scheme may not be director themselves and the legislation seem to recognise that as the low incomes tax reform group point out the original draft legislation refer to director shadow director and manager which they feel cover the full range of people who may be behind tax avoidance scheme however while the legislation include reference to shadow director the category of manager be no long mention in his response will the minister explain the rationale behind remove the reference to manager and consider whether that need to be reconsider on those recruit to be sham director the low incomes tax reform group have give powerful example of where young or vulnerable people can be recruit without understand what they be get into while ignorance be not an excuse it be reasonable for hmrc to ensure that the consequence for vulnerable individual who have unwittingly get involve be not unreasonably harsh furthermore this be about not only protect vulnerable people but ensure the sham director do not end up take the fall for those behind the scheme thereby let the latter off be punish and leave they free to exploit new round of vulnerable recruit in his response will the minister explain what process and check hmrc will be put in place to identify vulnerable people thereby make sure that any action against sham director be appropriate for the individual concern we know that there be wide issue of bad faith actor set up shell company with fake director and then use those shell company for range of purpose include the practice of sit behind dodgy american theme candy store to avoid pay business rate we have be call for tough identity verification requirement for new company in the case of business rate this would strengthen council ability to take enforcement action against those who do not pay their bill realise it be beyond the scope of this debate but will the minister write to with detail of what conversation he have have with the secretary of state for business and trade about use power in the economic crime transparency and enforcement act to specify identity verification requirement for new company with companies house clause introduce new strict liability criminal offence for fail to comply with stop notice issue by hmrc in relation to tax avoidance scheme in practice this clause will escalate the punishment for fail to comply with stop notice from its current position which be penalty of up to or million in certain circumstance to instead mean that the promoter have commit criminal offence if they fail to comply with stop notice without reasonable excuse we welcome firm action be take against those promote tax avoidance scheme however the chartered institute of taxation have make it clear to hmrc that it be concerned that the decision to issue stop notice and thereby determine that criminal act may have be commit will rest entirely with hmrc with no external oversight to make sure that appropriate safeguard be in place understand the chartered institute have propose that failure to comply with stop notice should be criminal offence only if judicial approval for the issue of the notice have be obtain first alternatively at the very least the chartered institute of taxation have make it clear that hmrc internal governance oversee the issuing of stop notice must work effectively similarly the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales have propose number of safeguard which understand the government have say that they will not consider the icaew have also suggest that such stop notice should be issue only through decision take at high level of seniority within hmrc than at present understand that hmrc have say that it do not support any of the range of safeguard propose by these representative body but have say that it will be share clear picture of its governance process in due course would be grateful if the minister confirm when that will happen and what check and balance he expect this governance process to enshrine finally will address clause which relate to the construction industry scheme and gross payment status under the construction industry scheme we know that contractor make deduction from payment to subcontractor and pass that money on to hmrc as an advance payment against the subcontractor tax liability we know that subcontractor can avoid this money be withhold by apply for gross payment status clause limit those subcontractor who can hold this status by exclude any who fail to meet vat obligation and who be involve in various category of tax fraud we welcome the principle of this measure in set out to penalise subcontractor who do not follow the rule on tax however we recognise the concern which be again raise by the chartered institute of taxation that it could have disproportionate effect on the cashflow and reputation of subcontractor if they be to lose gross payment status as result of minor vat compliance failure we therefore welcome the fact that as we understand it draft regulation have be publish to attempt to address this point would welcome the minister further reassurance today that the treasury will engage with the industry include the chartered institute of taxation to make sure that the regulation be effective as have make clear we will not be oppose the clause be consider in this debate but look forward to the minister response to the detailed question that have raise in relation to they wish to raise just couple of point let turn to the issue of pillar and the move forward of the government policy on that in clause and schedule obviously that relate to change the decision maker on the taxation rate for multinational operate in this country from the british government elect by the british people to the determination of an international organisation through treaty as we move forward it be important to be aware of the change context hon member particularly those from the conservative benches have raise in the past the issue of who else be come along to this particular minimum tax global party we already know that china one of the major economic actor in the world be not part of the oecd will not be comply with we and will not be part of these regulation first be interested in any update the minister may have on those view about china secondly it be clear that there will be an election in the united states later this year and that there be significant difference in opinion between the republican party and the democrats about whether they will enact the us part in the taxation policy of pillar and particularly in pillar give that there be reasonable chance some say it be well than chance that there may be change in administration in november and the united states could then withdraw from participation in the oecd process can the minister in his sum up give some reassurance to those conservative members who although always supportive of the prime minister may just want to make sure that we have clarity on what we would do in the eventuality that neither of the two major economy in the world the united states and china be take part in this particular global minimum tax from multinational would also be interested to hear from the minister perhaps not from the dispatch box today but separately with the taxation minister where the definition of certain word be move in the treasury and hmrc when it come to tax avoidance and tax evasion recall that many year ago the difference be that tax evasion be illegal and that tax avoidance while perhaps not what the hmrc want to happen be legal we see in the finance bill reference to tax avoidance that imply that it be illegal worry that there be insufficient clarity from hmrc perspective on the difference between tax evasion which be illegal and tax avoidance which be legal but perhaps not desirable perhaps the minister could give some clarity on that all those on the treasury bench will be aware of the persistence of the concern about the loan charge and other aspect of tax avoidance scheme which hmrc have go to court over win in certain action and then decide to apply blanket solution to case where there have never be finding of fact in court regard the particular scheme my specific question hope that this be within scope dame rosie you will tell if it be not be why we have not bring hmrc approach on tackle the loan charge to conclusion people have be pursue for far too long in an area that be far too grey it would be interesting if the minister have an update on that lastly commend the shadow minister the hon member for ealing north james murray do not like his speech on the first group but think that his speech on the present group be very good and very reasonable he make very important point which be sure the government will want to look at on failure to comply with stop notice and the requirement propose think he say by third party for some sort of judicial approval before notice be issue at the moment the bill basically say that hmrc undefined can issue such notice that really be quite significant further expansion of hmrc responsibility the shadow minister refer to good point more protection be need for those who might be catch by such notice be sure that those on the government front bench always listen to point make on both side of the house but think that would commend that point from the shadow minister will speak to new clause and table in my name reiterate that the liberal democrats do not support the bill which be deception from the government after year of tax hike on hard work family it arise from an autumn statement that contribute to record fall in living standard by maintain the government stealth tax on work family through the freezing of income tax threshold some of the measure under consideration today may have worthy aim but that wide context must be note new clause table in my name would require the government to produce an assessment of the impact of the bill tax evasion and avoidance measure that assessment would specifically need to include review of whether the staffing of the compliance function of hmrc be sufficient to implement the new measure that follow the revelation to in answer to parliamentary question last year that almost hmrc tax compliance staff be still work on matter relate to our exit from the european union and scheme that mean that thousand of staff who would usually be work on recover taxis or deal with other issue be instead be redeploy to manage the government mishandle of the pandemic and the brexit deal it be alarming to see civil servant be move from one crisis to another an indication of government in non stop firefighting mode we have know for long time that hmrc be an organisation beset by understaffe issue last year the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales say that such chronic understaffing be not only cause unacceptable delay to business and family but hinder activity and actively hurt our economy with that knowledge can we have faith that hmrc will be properly equip to put the measure in the bill into action while the measure in clause to and schedule may have worthy aim of combat tax avoidance and fraud the knowledge of those shortcoming make it very difficult to have confidence in the capacity of hmrc and in particular its compliance function to administer the measure effectively therefore urge the government to accept new clause and support the liberal democrats in ensure that hmrc be fully equip with sufficient staff to tackle tax avoidance properly new clause also in my name concern the bill pillar measure in clause and schedule it would require the government to produce an assessment of the impact of those measure examine whether they have be successful in achieve their policy aim as liberal democrats we strongly believe in the need for fair international system that tackle corporate tax avoidance and evasion for the benefit of all country we welcome the pioneer work that have take place under the auspex of the oecd for the formation of fair international tax system the measure in clause arise from that process and enable the uk adoption of the income inclusion rule and domestic minimum top up tax rule as such they be to be welcome however issue remain most crucially we believe that the global minimum corporation tax rate set at under the deal remain too low liberal democrats have call on the government to help negotiate an increase to as originally propose by the us under president biden organisation such as oxfam have highlight that the minimum rate still leave many develop country at disadvantage as they will continue to face unfair competition from tax haven it be extremely disappointing to see the government failure to back rate of despite have raise uk corporation tax to the significant progress that have be make should not be obstruct or dilute but if we be serious about pursue the goal of fair global tax system we must also take the time to ensure that the good path be be follow understand the intent of what the hon member say could she explain how the review could be do within six month of the act be pass give that no business will have file tax return with any adjustment in until well after that period indeed half the world probably will not have introduce the measure by that stage would that not be bit of premature assessment would we not risk that assessment show no progress and then strengthen the argument of those who would like to repeal it it would probably be quite bad assessment to do at that stage welcome the hon member intervention and dare say it completely agree with he of course one be constrain by what one can amend in legislation but would like to see that as the start of an ongoing process of review let we be honest it be an innovative proposal not just because it require an international co operative effort but because that very effort be innovative it be therefore something that we as sovereign parliament should be keep very much under review as the work continue briefly note that the finance bill have implication for theatre tax relief which play crucial role in enable the development of new theatre production in the uk uk theatre and the society of london theatre have raise concern with the treasury about those implication which could damage how that essential relief operate therefore urge minister to liaise with those group and particularly to provide assurance that international touring will not be hamper due to the bill definition of uk expenditure that be certainly an area that would benefit from scrutiny in public bill committee although the liberal democrats support certain measure in the bill such as the extension of full expensing the bill as whole do not have our support arise as it do from an unjust and deceptive autumn statement urge hon member to support the amendment table in my name in particular new clause which would hold the government to account to ensure that hmrc be properly resource to allow it to implement the measure in the bill thank hon member from across the house for their contribution will speak relatively briefly but will try to address some of the point raise will deal last with the new clause and in the meantime address some of the question from the hon member for ealing north james murray from the official opposition he ask about pillar and the progress be make this government fully support pillar and be keen to maintain momentum on its progress as soon as possible he should take comfort from the recent publication of the substantially agree text of the multilateral convention that demonstrate progress but as say we be not complacent on that and be keen to see further progress as soon as possible the hon gentleman very reasonably ask for more information on sentencing and the action take by hmrc will give he some datum last year there be prosecution within that there be conviction and of those be custodial sentence and be suspend sentence that equate to success rate for hmrc the hon gentleman be right that the average length of custodial sentence be month we want to extend maximum sentence for two reason first to make it clear that we consider fraud and all fraudulent activity some of the most serious crime possible because of its impact on public finance and secondly because if the maximum sentence increase we expect all sentence to rise as sentence be judge relative to the maximum sentence however stress that it be the sentencing council that issue the guidance to judge and it be ultimately judge and the court who rightly decide what sentence be give to those find guilty the hon gentleman ask about safeguard for stop notice and he be right to highlight that that be an important measure for hmrc can tell he there have already be stop notice issue since hmrc start issue they just year ago but there be robust governance process and safeguard in place include review and appeal right however any criminal sentence be decide by the court and it be the sentencing council that will decide on that will look carefully at the other question he have raise and ask for write response if we have that datum commit to write to he with that information my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller have rightly and consistently raise his question and concern on pillar can tell he that the uk be implement pillar in time and alongside eu member state japan and canada which think he would agree be all peer he ask about china china have not announce implementation plan for pillar but it be member of the inclusive framework of country that be in negotiation right now on pillar and we be monitor that very carefully as he would expect the us administration have always support both pillar and and have be one of the strong advocate for they as he will know in the united states introduce its own domestic version of pillar require those company with foreign income to pay minimum level of taxation the punchline to answer my hon friend ultimate question be that already the agreement have be put in place to ensure that by of multinational will be in play so we be confident in the robustness of that agreement he ask about the loan charge do not believe that be in scope for this debate but the financial secretary to the treasury will follow up with he and engage with he and the loan charge and taxpayer fairness all party parliamentary group in due course will briefly address the new clause that have be lay down will deal with new clause and together as they all relate to tax avoidance and evasion and then will address new clause new clause would require the chancellor to provide report on the average sentence and range of sentence give to offence be amend in clause the number of stop notice issue that clause would apply to and the impact of those clause on tax revenue new clause would require the chancellor to carry out an assessment of the impact of clause to and schedule on hmrc compliance activity and new clause would require the chancellor to review the effectiveness of the provision of clause in combat fraud involve taxpayer money let say straight out of the gate that agree it be important that we regularly review and evaluate policy however the new clause be unnecessary as hmrc already publish detailed information about its compliance and performance on regular basis as have say the uk tax gap be already at an all time low of and will remain low and stable give the measure that we be implement every year hmrc publish information on the number of custodial sentence receive for tax compliance offence and the average sentence length in hmrc annual report and account the annual report and account will be publish this summer provide full overview of hmrc performance as most of that information be already publicly available in routine hmrc publication the assessment legislate for by the new clause be unnecessary in our humble view new clause would require the government to report an assessment of the technical change to pillar introduce in clause and schedule it would consider the efficacy of the technical change and their impact on multinational profit shifting and tax competition between jurisdiction the government consider that such report be not necessary because the amendment in the bill be technical change to enhance the pillar legislation that receive royal assent just last year those amendment simply help to ensure that the policy objective of the legislation be meet fairly and effectively reflect both new international guidance and stakeholder comment ultimately it be about avoid unintended consequence in legislation that have already be pass of course the government will monitor pillar overall impact as business begin to respond to its implementation around the country be privy to it hope to have reassure member that the addition in new clause and be not necessary for the reason that have set out urge the committee to reject they commend clause and to and schedule and to the committee question put and agree to clause accordingly order to stand part of the bill schedule agree to clause and order to stand part of the bill schedule agree to clause and order to stand part of the bill new clause review of measure to tackle evasion and avoidance the chancellor of the exchequer must within three month of this act be pass publish review of the measure in section to to tackle evasion and avoidance the review under subsection must include detail of the average sentence hand down in each of the last five year for the offence list in section the range of sentence hand down in each of the last five year for the offence list in section the number of stop notice issue in each of the last five year to which the measure in section would apply and the estimate impact on revenue collect in each of the next five financial year result from the introduction of the measure in section to murray this new clause would require the chancellor to publish detail of the sentence give and stop notice issue in each of the last five year to tackle evasion and avoidance as well as the revenue expect to be generate from the measure to tackle evasion and avoidance in this act in each of the next five year bring up and read the first time question put that the clause be read second time diane

whittingdale bill wiggin james wild craig williams gavin williamson william wragg jeremy wright jacob young mike wood suzanne webb the committee divide ayes noes question accordingly negative clause rebate on heavy oil and certain bioblend use for heating question propose that the clause stand part of the bill with this it will be convenient to discuss clause stand part will take clause first the change that it make clarify how vat and excise legislation should be interpret in the light of change make by the retained eu revocation and reform act which come into effect on january the act end the supremacy and special status afford to retain eu law in the uk as we make clear when it be introduce the government be take bespoke approach to uk vat and excise law in line with the act clause confirm that for vat and excise it will no long be possible for any part of any uk act of parliament or domestic subordinate legislation to be quash or disapplie on the basis that it be incompatible with eu law in other word it will no long be possible for business to rely on eu law where it be in conflict with domestic law the measure also provide that uk vat and excise law continue to be interpret as parliament intend draw on right and principle that currently apply in interpret uk law this legislation which be subject to provisional collection of taxes act resolution from january ensure the stability of the vat and excise regime and provide legal certainty for business follow the change in the retained eu law revocation and reform act take effect it mitigate the risk of relitigate the settle interpretation of uk law protect billion of pound of exchequer revenue vat and excise duty from alcohol tobacco and hydrocarbon oil raise over billion of revenue year vat be litigious area with the exist framework and precedent protect large amount of revenue for example billion of tax revenue be protect in just five vat case with the support of such precedent vat operate in real time with vat invoice and the associated money be pass between business and other business or consumer on the basis of the law in place at that time which mean legal certainty be key business rely on this to ensure that their tax affair be correct and hmrc rely on it to collect tax eu principle and right will therefore continue to apply solely as aid to interpret uk legislation any potential change in interpretation would create uncertainty for business it could open up loophole to be exploit by those look to avoid pay their fair share risk billion of pound of exchequer fund move on to clause at budget to help meet our climate change and air quality target the government announce that we would remove the entitlement to use rebated fuel from most sector rebated fuel such as red diesel and certain heavy oil incur low rate of fuel duty in contrast to the petrol and diesel use by car and other road vehicle which incur the full rate of fuel duty as part of these reform the government decide to continue to allow rebated heavy oil other than red diesel and bio blend make with red diesel to be use for all heating us due to the concern that remove the entitlement to use these fuel for this purpose would significantly increase the heating bill of the household and business that use they especially in area off the gas grid however as enact the hydrocarbon oil duties act prevent machine and appliance from use certain rebated heavy oil for commercial heating that include fuel oil use in some commercial heating application include in furnace as the government intention be to continue to allow the use of rebated fuel for heating hmrc have exercise its discretion on collection and management power to allow the use on this basis the assumption be that the exist legislation would be change at the early opportunity which be what we be do now clause amend the act give clarity to the dozen or so business affect by this anomaly in line with the government announce policy position make it clear that no consumer have be disadvantage by this error these change be necessary to provide legal certainty for business and to ensure that the relevant regime operate as intend therefore commend clause and to the committee call the shadow minister rise to speak to the clause relate to vat and excise begin with clause which restore the full tax rebate for machine and appliance that use non gas heavy oil and bio blend for commercial heating purpose the government have say that this be to correct an anomaly bring about by the april change to the hydrocarbon oil duties act which mean that machine use kerosene have benefit from full rebate while those use other type of heavy oil be make ineligible for low duty rate when use for heating the government have say that their april tax change be intend to reduce the use of gas fuel and to make progress against the uk climate commitment however perversely under the current system company receive tax penalty for use next generation renewable fuel such as hydrotreate vegetable oil for heating instead of kerosene despite the fact that hvo produce nearly less greenhouse gas emission therefore support clause which seek to correct that unintended error and restore equivalent tax treatment for the use of non gas heavy fuel for commercial heating however let we be clear the correction will have limited impact on business across the uk face rocket heating bill as the cold start to bite this winter we also know that it be often the scandalous lack of grid connection that force many business particularly in rural area of scotland to operate their machine off grid use heavy oil and biofuel change tax incentive although significant will not deliver the overhaul our energy system need to become clean energy superpower after year of mismanagement our energy grid be on its knee with new development force to wait up to year for new connection and more than billion of privately fund energy project stick in limbo labour will prioritise reform the grid oversee the large upgrade to our national transmission infrastructure in generation and accelerate connection for those who be force off grid we can not afford to keep drag our foot any long the government claim they be serious about deliver the transition and boost the use of clean energy source but the neglect of our grid infrastructure have be shocking we know that the significant increase in both clean power generation and clean industry that the uk will need to reach net zero will require four time as much grid infrastructure in the next seven year as have be build in the past although the opposition do not oppose clause which be welcome correction ensure that tax incentive for non gas heavy fuel remain consistent be the bare minimum we should be expect from the government on this vital issue move on to clause which seek to clarify uk primacy on vat and excise law follow the passage of the retained eu law revocation and reform bill the government draft legislation seek to ensure that in relation to vat and excise law it will no long be possible for any uk act of parliament or domestic subordinate legislation to be quash or disapplie on the basis that it be incompatible with retain eu law the government state that this measure will ensure the stability of the vat and excise regime provide legal certainty for business labour unsurprisingly support the objective of this legislation ensure that firm have clarity over how the vat and excise regime should be interpret follow the uk departure from the eu be crucial to retain business confidence however follow the government public consultation which conclude in november it remain entirely unclear whether the measure achieve its stated objective of reduce the complexity for business of interpret the vat regime in its consultation response the chartered institute of taxation highlight number of concern about the proposal point out that the significant complexity in interpret this draft legislation risk undermine the certainty it seek to deliver specifically the ciot point out that the distinction draw in the legislation between disapplication and the quashing of uk law as result of eu law and interpretation might in practice be insufficient to achieve the desire result consultation feedback also point out that the measure in clause do not make it clear how far high court be intend to be bind by prior case law from the court of justice of the eu thus create uncertainty for business and adviser although take bespoke uk approach to vat and excise legislation be welcome in principle the draft legislation also fail to address the fact that the removal of the reliance on eu provision will create significant gap in uk legislation where our domestic rule book do not fully transpose eu directive it be not just tax expert that have seek to draw attention to this issue through the government consultation the industry body for the banking and finance sector uk finance have warn over and over again that the draft legislation do not appear to adequately address the complexity of the vat landscape thereby sustain high degree of uncertainty for industry and the prospect of settle interpretation of vat law be disturb the trade body point out that although eu vat law include clear vat exemption for intermediary service in connection with bank account the exemption have not be implement in uk law with business no long able to rely on the direct effect of eu law material change to vat exemption in the financial service sector will come into effect that be just one example from my own shadow brief but it highlight the additional uncertainty that this clarify draft legislation have already create for business despite the clear message from tax expert and industry in the consultation it seem that the proposal be at good problematic it be of particular concern that the government seem to have ignore that feedback and plough on with not single amendment make to the draft legislation detailed guidance be need to address the significant issue that have already be raise regard clause and to ensure it meet its objective labour will not oppose the measure as we remain supportive of it in principle but urgent clarity be need as it will come into effect from the beginning of this year the shock that government measure design to provide legal certainty and stability have raise more question than answer have slightly wear off for those of we oblige to follow the circus on the government benches on daily basis to conclude we will not oppose the two clause but the detail of the proposal continue to raise question about the competence of the government from be able to afford low carbon fuel and avoid crippling heating bill to have certainty over the vat regime uk business deserve far well after year of leadership we need government who can provide the confidence that business desperately need use the clean energy source of the future to drive growth and investment across the country it be pleasure to have sit through the committee stage of the bill and to hear the government talk about the advantage we have from brexit be pleased to hear that the government have look and continue to look extensively at the taxation system in particular at the interpretation of vat as mention in this clause one interpretation of vat in this country massively affect people who be visually impair and those who can not read perhaps because of dyslexia there be no vat on book but the treasury apply vat to audiobook if that interpretation of vat be to be take as far as it possibly can be disappointed that disabled people be not be protect within the structure of the bill in the way that they have be for many year year ago when be disability minister be tell that vat change could not happen because we be in the eu we be no long in the eu and we can set our vat rate as we would like it would be fundamentally good if the government come forward with an interpretation of vat that say that people who rely on audiobook through no fault of their own do not have to be penalise by vat be not talk only about the visually impaired declare an interest be dyslexic and rely on audiobook although not completely people who do not read braille be be punish as well the government continue to look at new taxation rule and new way of make sure that people do not get around the taxation system and it be clear that they be look at the implementation of vat what well spring present for those who rely on audiobook than for the minister to say that he will meet talk about the issue far and perhaps look at the early day motion in my name the technical change in clause and open up lot of question agree with the labour front bench spokespeople that there be many question on operation that still have to be answer but there be wide question about both these clause inspire by their context before get to they want to point out that this finance bill be stark reminder that the westminster government never reflect the value of the people of scotland we need independence so that we can build fair and dynamic economy that work for everyone people be suffer through the bitter cost of living crisis the provision set out in the finance bill be nowhere near enough to help household in scotland which have be leave pay the price for disastrous decision by westminster governments not least the harm of brexit there be no help for family struggle with rocket food price and no help for mortgage payer many of whom be now see huge increase in their fix rate deal the cold be bite right now week ago this westminster government oversee not the hop for help of the energy bill rebate that we in the snp call for but another hike courtesy of the price cap increase although clause be right small wrong people live off the gas grid deserve lot more help than be be offer with this measure they should have have the comfort of be include in regulation under ofgem as imperfect as that organisation be indeed introduce ten minute rule bill in this house to ask for that yet people live off grid be still suffer from wild west approach to pricing in how they heat their home that affect many people across my constituency and other large rural area they simply do not have choice when price surge this be tiny measure be take today and more should have be do mention the support that we call for but social tariff should also have be consider there should have be reduction not increase in the price cap to help people at this juncture energy policy as we know be fully reserve to westminster and it be the chancellor who decide whether people can afford to put the heat on well lot of folk can not afford to do so in my constituency and across the highland and island we produce six time more clean cheap renewable energy than be need by the people live there the massive bulk of that production be export to other part of the nation of the uk yet in return we get to pay high standing charge and high unit price in climate that demand that we use more to make life bearable we suffer the high fuel poverty electricity charge in the highland be around high than they be here in london accord to ofgem how be that fair the chancellor offer year off energy bill for those live near plan new power line and generate equipment the question we now ask be what about those already live next to and among generate equipment why should they not be include and compensate in the same way after the long year of this energy injustice it must now be time to right that wrong the chancellor must establish highland energy rebate and again speed be of the essence all of this and more should be do but the fact be that this place do not act on scotland need we have the energy but we do not have the power we should have that through independence on clause as highlight in the explanatory note to the bill and in the minister comment we know that the chancellor will raise more than billion pound year in vat and excise duty alone significant amount of that on the back of scotland food whisky and oil production the now labour and the liberal be suppose to release the mean to support business instead all brexit have bring be red tape and heartache we see the result of that today in this debate so let we see the government step forward be not expect they to fulfil the wild promise of brexit there be no possibility of that but let we see whether they can live up to tiny amount in the form of vat cut for the tourism and hospitality sector and some support for disabled people agree with the right hon member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning that there should be more attention pay to that the uk government attempt to sell the tax measure set out in the statement as giveaway for work people be beyond belief the office for budget responsibility have be clear that the chancellor decision to freeze income tax will create million extra taxpayer by with million people more in high tax band this be tory make cost of living crisis the reality be that household in scotland be pay the price for the uk government mismanagement of the economy with an especially devastating impact on vulnerable people the stark difference between the uk government autumn statement and consequently the bill and the scottish government budget which prioritise ensure that everyone in scotland can have decent standard of living be timely reminder of why we need to get our own governance in december report by unicef find that the uk child poverty rate be among the high in the world rich country the report compare well off country effort to reduce child poverty and the uk rank as one of the worst perform come out of the nation of the eu and the oecd we also know that the cost of living crisis be disproportionately impact disabled people again the call for vat cut be valid but there be nothing in the chancellor autumn statement or the bill that will do anything to make it easy for those with disability to get through this cost of living crisis indeed the government seem committed to make the life of those with disability more difficult through renew focus on ramp up the use of cruel benefit sanction in october last year research by scope find that nearly one in three disabled people face debt james taylor executive director of strategy at scope note when disabled people be be push into debt and can afford to eat stay warm or shower it clear the system be break these figure lie bare the fact disabled people be be hit hard in this crisis it be utterly shameful that the uk government have fail to introduce measure in the autumn statement or the bill that would improve the life of million of people who be face poverty and in some case actual destitution the fundamental problem with the autumn statement and the bill be what be omit from it be this not the problem if we do not invest in people health and wellbeing in the long term it will cost the nhs social service and the department for work and pensions even more to support people as they continue to spiral down do that not contrast with the preventive approach that the scottish government take with such innovation as the baby box and the child payment my hon friend be right the on cost of not do so lead to further problem and to high cost not only to the public purse but to the mental and physical wellbeing of those who be impact by the cost of living crisis these major fiscal event serve as tangible example of the total mismatch between the value of the uk government and the people of scotland the thing that the uk government choose to spend money on and the tax measure that they have choose to leave out of the bill such as abolish non dom status be clear reminder of that it be abhorrent that at the same time as announce cruel measure to force ill and disabled people into work the uk government do not include any provision on make the tax system fairer there be countless example of the uk government waste money and then attempt to claw back the fund by target group who be the least well off the return to draconian measure force on ill and disabled people be just the late example the stark difference between the bill and the scottish government budget which prioritise ensure that everyone in scotland can have decent standard of living be timely reminder of why we need independence the snp believe that build strong economy start with give people decent standard of living and our most recent budget reflect that as my hon friend the member for glasgow north patrick grady mention the scottish government budget reflect the people of scotland share value and speak to the kind of scotland that we want to be it be important to remember that the scottish government have achieve that against the backdrop of their very limited ability to raise additional revenue through taxis and have to work largely with fix budget despite those very difficult circumstance the scottish government have once again show their commitment to protect the nhs from strike as well as invest in it and shield the most vulnerable people as far as possible from the impact of regressive westminster policy while the tories have just deliver real term cut to england nhs in their autumn statement the scottish government announce an increase to the frontline nhs budget in real term they also remain committed to help those most impact by the cost of living crisis in their budget last month the scottish government increase the game change scottish child payment in line with inflation to week give more support to the more than who receive it they maintain their commitment to invest billion over the course of this parliament to tackle the poverty relate attainment gap with million to be distribute in they be commit to fund the per hour real living wage for adult and child social care and early learning and childcare worker in the private voluntary and independent sector that deliver fund provision they have help household through the cost of live crisis by make available an additional million of funding to council that agree to fully fund council tax freeze in the funding equivalent of support increase those be just the late measure the scottish government have take to promote equality the scottish government have of course introduce landmark policy to ensure that everyone in scotland have access to decent standard of living if westminster be in charge scotland would lose thing like free university tuition free school meal free period product free bus travel for and free childcare for three and four year old as well as eligible two year old all that be possible because the scottish government take different approach to budget than this place and we need to ensure that we can do that in much more effective way through the power of independence think some hon member may have try to expand the debate strictly beyond the scope of the measure we be debate for understandable reason will stick strictly to the clause my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning make some important point about ensure that we take full advantage of the benefit of leave the european union of course we have already make progress in that area by remove replace and improve retain eu law include revoke all direct eu regulation in relation to customs duty introduce uk tariff and domestic custom regime introduce vat relief for woman period product and for the installation of energy save material and so on on the point he make regard potential future change to vat we of course always keep tax under review he will forgive for not make tax policy at the dispatch box this evening tempt as be that be the purpose of key fiscal event will absolutely commit to meet my right hon friend as be always willing to listen and hear comment comment be make about encourage the use of green fuel the government encourage the use of renewable fuel through the renewable transport fuel obligation which incentivise the use of low carbon fuel and reduce emission from fuel supply for use in transport and non road mobile machinery on the point about the court of justice the european union withdrawal act provide that court of justice of the european union judgment issue since the end of the implementation period be not bind on uk court on the point about codify everything try to codify all interpretative effect into black and white uk law would of course be huge endeavour and would require complete review of all that legislation take many year and still leave significant tax revenue at risk question put and agree to clause accordingly order to stand part of the bill clause order to stand part of the bill the deputy speaker resume the chair bill clauses and schedule clause schedule clause and to and schedule report without amendment and order to lie on the table economic activity of public bodies overseas matters bill third read king consent signify must inform the house that the reason amendment in the name of keir starmer have be select beg to move that the bill be now read the third time be grateful for the opportunity to move the third reading of this bill as the house will know this bill be introduce before the king speech in the last parliamentary session it be carry over bill begin by thank all those who take part in the consideration of this bill on second reading in committee and on report inevitably follow on from its introduction debate around the bill have occur in the dark shadow of the event of october and the continue conflict in israel and gaza that be why want to stress as seek to do on report my gratitude for the thoughtful way in which every member of this house have contribute to debate on this bill while there be know difference of opinion about the appropriateness of the measure we be bring forward everyone in this house be commit to ensure that we act against antisemitism everyone in this house be commit to ensure that we can see peaceful solution to the conflict in the middle east and everyone in this house be commit to two state solution as the mean by which we can bring peace to that troubled region the bill uphold principle that be originally outline in our general election manifesto during the course of consideration of the bill we have hear from number of organisation both in committee and in broad public debate about the bill all affirm its timeliness and importance in deal with the continue and grow threat of antisemitism and uphold the importance of make sure that the uk government speak with one voice in united way on behalf of all of we on foreign policy as reserved matter for the government in that context it be important to deal with one or two entirely understandable and legitimate concern that have be raise about the interplay between the bill itself and uk government foreign policy know some particular concern have be raise about clause assure colleague that the clause do not contravene in any way our foreign policy or inhibit in any way the uk government take action if we believe there be activity in the occupied palestinian territories that require to be call out we continue to raise as the foreign secretary have recently issue of illegal settler activity and lord cameron have be clear with the israeli government that the uk government be in profound disagreement with some of those action and some of that activity will come on to that in just second should say that the clause do not prevent the government establish sanction or use travel ban against those who have be link to blatant human right abuse it be simply the aim of this legislation to prevent public body from adopt their own foreign policy as such decision should ultimately be the remit of the government and this house rise know give the nature of the debate on this bill that number of colleague would like to intervene will try to answer question briefly because know number of colleague would like to take part in the debate hypothetical be not always helpful but beg my right hon friend indulgence in this hypothetical on that particular point about the interaction between clause and uk foreign policy uk foreign policy be clear that illegal israeli settlement in the occupied territory be against international law this bill would provide that if pension fund be give an investment policy for expand say an infrastructure fund proposal in the occupy territory it would have no moral basis for refuse to invest although that investment would be expand israeli policy contrary to uk foreign policy can the secretary of state explain how to unpack that so that what he have just say be what believe be true it be specifically the case that public body include the local government pension scheme and local authority should not be take decision that conflict with uk government foreign policy and we be absolutely clear that it would conflict with uk government foreign policy if they be to engage in freelance activity of that kind however it be perfectly open to any representative include any elect representative to express their personal disapproval of the activity of the israeli government or any organisation that operate within the settlement have be listen carefully to what the secretary of state be say on that point but last year the government state the uk have clear position on israeli settlement in the occupied palestinian territories they be illegal under international report march vol to speak plainly be not the secretary of state ashame that through this clampdown on the democratic right to boycott his government be restrict the right of those who want to take peaceful action against violation of international law and be in effect side with those break international law with respect to the hon gentleman who have take close personal interest in the conflict appreciate the sincerity with which he raise that point absolutely not there be clear intention in the bill which be to deal specifically with the boycott divestment and sanction campaign and its attempt to use the legitimacy of local government and other intermediate institution to undermine the uk government foreign policy the uk government of whichever colour must speak with one voice on behalf of the whole united kingdom when it come to foreign policy matter as be sure the hon gentleman will agree the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell and the foreign secretary have from this dispatch box and in the other place be clear with the israeli government when they think that it be appropriate to criticise their action and indeed those of individual operate within the settlement but there be an important distinction to be draw between criticism of the israeli government criticism of the act of particular individual and the nature of the bds campaign itself be grateful to opposition front benchers although we have our disagreement and to labour friends of israel for make it clear that the bds movement itself be explicitly and regrettably antisemitic it deliberately set out to argue that the state of israel as home for the jewish people should not exist agree with the comment that the secretary of state have just make israel be pretty much the only country that be target in this way despite the fact there be number of appal regime around the world on local authority do he agree that lot of councillor should focus on their core job of run local service instead of virtue signal and clumsily weigh in on complex international issue not for the first time entirely agree with my hon friend he sum up in that intervention two of the critical point in the bill first local government have many important function intervene in foreign policy in way that can exacerbate community tension be emphatically not one of they secondly there have be unique focus on the state of israel of course there be criticism that can and should be mount against the state of israel its government and their activity however the bds campaign single out israel for special treatment we have not see attempt by local government to criticise for example the action of bashar al assad in syria or variety of other regime that have be target innocent muslim life again one point that be make clearly by the now sadly depart former chief rabbi lord sacks be that antisemitism be virus that mutate over time in the past it be direct towards judaism as faith then it mutate to be direct towards the jewish people through direct racism now antisemitism find an expression through an attempt to deny the jewish people the same right of self determination and the same right to homeland that we extend to all people support for the bill from jewish organisation in this country the jewish leadership council the board of deputies of british jews and so on have be clear but perhaps the most telling be the word of the community security trust which be there to physically protect jewish people and community the cst be scrupulous in not offer any commentary on matter in israel and the middle east or on foreign policy it eschew do so because it recognise the diversity of view within the jewish community on some of those question but it have say that bds have chilling impact on jews modern reminder of anti jewish boycotts it also serve to legitimise the shunning of jews from decent society and have be shun that half way house to all manner of more abusive and physical outcome when we have see increase in antisemitic incident think it important to bear those word in mind my right hon friend be make some extremely important point about the nature of the bds movement be it not the case that as he say there have be very few example of council look to use the lever available to they to protest against other international issue be that not because the whole bds movement in fact the label be entirely construct as weapon against the state of israel when we look at the origin of the movement we see unfortunately that it be riddle from top to bottom with antisemitism be afraid that my right hon friend be absolutely correct again to be more than fair many prominent labour voice have make precisely that point the bds campaign those who create it and those who run it be very clear that they be single out israel they want to see an end to israel as jewish state be very conscious of the fact that number of right hon and hon member wish to contribute to the debate also want to emphasise again that horror and revulsion of antisemitism and prejudice of all kind be share across this house as be determination to see peace in the middle east we have rehearse the argument with great contribution in committee and on report and believe that this bill be targeted and proportionate approach to deal with unique evil hope that we will be able to support the bill but as say dissent voice in this house must always be hear with respect with that commend the bill to the house rise order as everybody know the debate will come to conclusion at pm number of people be try to catch my eye so be think that speech should last not much long than three minute to be frank depend on the contribution of the front benchers beg to move an amendment to leave out from that to the end of the question and add this house while oppose any discrimination or prejudice in the economic activity of public body believe that all such body must act without bias or selectivity when make ethical decision on procurement and investment and recognise the impact selective and biased campaign have have on the jewish community in particular decline to give third reading to the economic activity of public bodies overseas matters bill because it do not effectively address the problem it rightly seek to solve be incompatible with international law and un security council resolutions risk undermine support for group around the world face persecution include needlessly broad and sweeping draconian power while place unprecedented restriction on public body to express view on current and propose policy and represent major departure from the uk government long establish diplomatic position on the occupied palestinian territories and golan heights in way that undermine the uk future credibility and capacity to support diplomatic negotiation towards just and last peace in israel and palestine base on two state solution at time when consistent support for that objective be more important than ever let start by make clear that the labour party completely oppose policy of boycott divestment and sanction against israel it be in everyone interest that we find way forward to address genuine problem never have that be as important as it be now at time of heighten tension fear and distress both at home and abroad as such throughout the passage of this bill we have always try to seek consensus we do not think it be wrong for public body to take ethical investment and procurement decision in fact there be long tradition of council and other body take stance on such question however there be difference between apply consistent ethical principle and legitimate criticism of foreign government and what some have try to do by target just one individual state for example the world only jewish state or bad use the cover of these issue to whip up prejudice or discrimination that be completely wrong for the labour party that will never change and thank the secretary of state for acknowledge that we share common ground on those fundamental principle on that basis have hop that by now we would have bill that reflect that common ground however unfortunately our effort for consensus have be meet with blanket refusal four time we have come to this house with an alternative approach and four time ministers have lead government members in vote down every single one of those proposal seek not to unite the house but to divide it in every sense we do not want to be in this position where the house be be tell to approve such deeply flawed piece of legislation but regrettably that be where we have end up because the bill before we be indeed deeply flawed the bill contain sweep new power that create more uncertainty and run counter to our international obligation provision that would ban public body from make procurement decision base on country use of force labour completely unprecedented clause that make it illegal for public body many of they directly elect to express their view on policy new power for the secretary of state himself to call in and interrogate those he suspect fall foul of the bill and at its heart measure that be incompatible with both the government own long stand foreign policy and international law fly in the face of the uk obligation that be why respectfully dispute what the secretary of state say in his opening remark explicitly equate israel with the occupied palestinian territories and the golan heights be an unprecedented step to my knowledge this wording have never appear in british statute before and it seriously undermine our country long stand consistent and cross party support for two state solution so could not be more disappointed there be moment when all side of this house come together to resolve the deep seat issue face our community and this could have be one of they instead the government have refuse to listen so as the bill be read third time we have have to put forward reason amendment as final plea to the secretary of state to reconsider we all know that this be highly unusual procedure so want to make it clear why we have deem it necessary we recognise that there be problem to solve and we want to solve it too but if this bill mean protract legal battle in the court create more uncertainty than it address or bad simply fuel yet more division it will have achieve nothing it could in fact make matter bad have no doubt that this bill will be scrutinise and challenge if send to our colleague in the other place can only hope that we find further opportunity to forge consensus but the bill before the house be simply not fit to send to they the great shame be that in this challenging time we have the chance to speak with one voice against discrimination and division and for unity at home and last peace abroad and it be in that spirit that urge the whole house to support our amendment rise order there be eight member stand so let we start with limit of four minute again as say on second reading and on report speak with heavy heart and in some dismay but tell those on my front bench that will be vote against the bill this evening this bill obviously come at dreadful time as we mourn the death of so many israelis in heinous circumstance on october and the death of so many palestinians subsequently many of whom still lie under the rubble the fact that we in this house would seek to legislate against non violent protest in such an illiberal and draconian way seem to tragic at this particular point in time as the secretary of state know there be broadly three area in which and other colleague attempt to amend the bill and have concern the first area be as the shadow secretary of state point out the separate identification in the bill of israel and its conflation with the occupy territory and the golan heights we believe that contravene our undertaking at the united nations and indeed in international law which of course mean that the bill will spend lot of time in the court if it eventually see the light of day at the same time that be cause of great dismay to our ally in the arab world who of course we need at the moment more than ever to join we in seek peace in the dreadful conflict take place in the middle east that we should undermine our own status as fair dealer as it be in that part of the world seem to an unforced error the second area of serious concern be obviously the impact on free speech again as the shadow secretary of state point out it seem to incredible that we be put elect official and other in position where if they just stand up in certain circumstance and say they disagree with the law they will be commit criminal act it seem to an incredibly illiberal and backward step that we would strike blow against pluralism in that way the bill could stand without those restriction on free speech and as the secretary of state will know we attempt to amend it to remove they but that attempt be rebuff the third area be the sheer scale of the bill impact and the number of organisation that will be draw into it it be not just the local government pension fund of which be member but also every university in the land and private sector company that perform public service of some kind and be contractor to the government that will be draw in that be important because as the secretary of state will know this subject be very litigious there be lawyer sympathetic to israel and those sympathetic to palestine from the secretary of state speech it seem that the bill be aim squarely at that particular conflict in this world lawyer on both side will gear up and an industry will arise to attack defend analyse and scrutinise every decision and all these body will have to take significant internal legal advice to deal with it as well subject they all to this enormous burden seem to disproportionate to the problem that the government be try to address finally my great concern be for the impact on british jewry as the secretary of state have say he be try to bring this bill in to deal with the growth in antisemitism in the united kingdom but my view be that the bill will play entirely into the hand of the antisemite imagine that this bill will be manna to those rotten social medium group and whatsapp group that espouse conspiracy theory about israel and the jewish community they will see this as jonathan freedland order call the snp spokesperson with no time limit it be real pleasure to follow the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse hope that other member listen to his contribution and what he have to say because share his concern about use domestic legislation in this bill to deviate from foreign office policy that be the clear concern that many of we have in an exchange with the hon member for caerphilly wayne david when we explore this matter in committee we talk about what the actual foreign policy be the bill as it be currently construct clearly conflate israel the occupied palestinian territories and the golan heights yet the uk government guidance on overseas business risk state the uk have clear position on israeli settlement the west bank include east jerusalem gaza and the golan heights have be occupy by israel since settlement be illegal under international law constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict the concern we have be that the bill be less than subtle as change if not to direct policy then certainly in emphasis equate israel and the occupy territory be unique in any legislation let alone in statement and it question the uk long establish cross party support for two state solution base on border as party we believe that the bill be also an assault on westminster devolution settlement not just for the scottish parliament but for the welsh senedd the legislation undermine devolution and restrict the ability of public body to make their own moral judgment on matter of human right and climate consciousness hear the secretary of state argue that public body should not deviate from foreign policy as we have discover in this debate and in all the debate we have have in city of glasgow district council labour lead local authority give nelson mandela the freedom of the city of glasgow it also encourage the boycotting of south african good and service but foreign office policy at the time be not to support sanction on the apartheid south african regime so the question again be could glasgow district council in have award nelson mandela the freedom of the city of glasgow and would it have be allow to encourage the boycott of south african good and service under this bill if the bill have be in place then the answer to that question would be no my hon friend be do great job of put on record the snp opposition to this foul piece of legislation do he think it be particularly distasteful and grotesque that the bill be come at this time and that the uk government only legislative response to what be happen in the middle east be to try to bring forward proposal to stifle criticism of israel when it be clear and there be so much evidence that israel stand face charge of breach international law and breach the geneva convention surely most right minded people in this country who believe in decency and fairness will think that this be the wrong thing at the wrong time thank my hon friend for that intervention think many member have concern about whether it be appropriate to proceed with the bill at this moment in time other members may wish to state that when they get the opportunity to speak the bill extend to devolve governments and local authority in the devolved nation because procurement and investment by public body be not reserved matter it would appear to breach the sewel convention if the devolved legislature do not agree note that the scottish parliament have not provide legislative consent to the bill we be also concerned that public body will not be able to make decision about environmental protection for example friend of the earth have say that the bill will prevent public body from divest from fossil fuel as well as divert their money away from inadvertently fund human right abuse abroad such as modern slavery in corporate supply chain labour right would also not be allow to be consider poor worker right be not restrict to any one region of the world we see they from china to colombia from bangladesh to angola from cambodia to qatar and from mexico to romania and accord to the world economic forum the abuse of worker right around the world reach record high in believe that when public body make funding arrangement for procurement or anything else they should be allow to consider labour right our concern be that the bill do not allow that to happen want to make it clear as have at every stage of the bill that the scottish national party be concerned that antisemitism be on the rise around the world we must not look away and we must call it out whenever we see it antisemitism be truly global and iniquitous poison the bill do not address the very epidemic of rise antisemitism that the government claim they want to tackle we be also concerned that the government have ignore the evidence and concern that many organisation have put forward about the bill the balfour project the trade union unison of which be proud to be member the union of jewish students and jews for justice for palestinians have all provide good evidence on their concern about the bill but be afraid they have not be take on board by the government when we have consider these matter the government have reject sensible amendment some of we have real concern about clause and very real concern about clause never think would ever say it and be have to say again that seek the removal of clause the government reject amendment to protect devolution and other public body and amendment to ensure compatibility with human right the change of foreign policy the impinging on the right of devolved institution and other public body the ignoring of the evidence and the rejecting of sensible amendment be the key reason why the bill do not deserve third reading rise order there will be three minute limit until the end of the debate support the bill and urge other to do so as well but also want to emphasise that very much respect the view of those who have concern about how it will operate in practice and know that all member of the house whatever their view on the bill remain committed to peaceful settlement and negotiate two state solution have just return from visit to israel which will appear in the next publication of the register of members financial interests and believe strongly that we should be back israel not boycott it it have have to take military action to defend itself from vile and repulsive terrorist attack in which more than people lose their life last week visit an exhibition in tel aviv about the nova music festival where hundred of young people be gun down the display of shoe clothe and bag be chillingly reminiscent of yad vashem and the pile of belonging take from jewish people on arrival at the death camp we can be in no doubt that the bds movement be divisive and damaging it reject two state solution and consistently oppose effort to bring israelis and palestinians together as the government have state again this evening bds activity drive antisemitism be especially concerned about the impact of israel boycott on campus where anti israel hatred so often morph into racist treatment of jewish student it be entirely unacceptable for jewish student to feel unable to be open about their faith or identity for fear of reprisal and harassment furthermore foreign policy be the responsibility of government it be and always have be reserved power there be no need or justification for university local authority or other public body to run their own foreign policy if sanction or boycott need to be impose that be decision to be make in this house at national level in conclusion this important bill at very difficult time tackle very serious problem commend it to the house and hope my colleague will back it it be with heavy heart again that be participate in today debate throughout december alongside the pope and the archbishop of canterbury seek to shed light on the suffering of christians in gaza city who include my own family let express sincere gratitude to member across the house who have approach in the last few day to ask how they be although the medium attention mitigate the immediate danger the plight of gaza resident persist live hand to mouth drink unclean water and wonder how on earth the world be let this happen be equally concerned about the impact on the street in the uk we be see rise in antisemitism and anti muslim hate which be unacceptable and must be call out too extend my sympathy to the hon lady and her family my own council cyngor gwynedd call for an immediate ceasefire last month echo people concern it condemn both hamas violence and israel disproportionate attack on civilian the senedd have also call for ceasefire the bill will restrict member of welsh democratic institution from voice their view and be sure the hon lady agree that such restriction on free speech be threat to our democracy across the nation of the united kingdom absolutely agree the bill do not respect directly elect body and those representative the issue be also about the timing the death toll in gaza now exceed and over israeli hostage remain do not put those number side by side to compare because every single individual lose or missing be tragedy the humanitarian situation have reach new depth doctor constituent of mine who be work in gaza say that he have see preventable death due to staff shortage and the medical system have totally collapse we now have injure with nowhere to go tomorrow the international court of justice will consider south africa case on israel allege violation and obligation under the genocide convention be sure need not remind this house that it be precisely local government lead intervention here in the uk which would be outlaw under the bill that pressure the thatcher government to add their support to the people of south africa yesterday the foreign secretary say that he do not agree with the icj case and do not think we should bandy around term like genocide south africa be not bandy around term the icj be precisely the court in which those allegation should be look at the principle be simple the uk should not pre judge the outcome of the legal case it should back the process and the court itself full throatedly end by simply say that the liberal democrats will continue to advocate for an immediate bilateral ceasefire secure hostage release deliver aid and work towards that precious two state solution our response to this war will be judge by history in fractured world where democracy need to be strengthen and the international rule base order help the bill undermine local government damage our global standing and divide our street this place should be place where we unite not divide people frankly the liberal democrats believe that this debate should not be happen we stand with humanity and peace and it be for that reason that we will be vote against the bill today the government introduction of the bill be welcome and support it it be in conservative party manifesto year ago and we have mandate and an obligation to pass it this legislation will finally stop public body from wrongfully pursue their own independent foreign policy agenda which have almost exclusively be the result of divisive antisemitic partisan campaign pursue by the antisemitic bds movement of course as have already be mention that be movement whose executive board the bds national committee be coalition of proscribe terrorist group include hamas so support the bill the boycott movement have undeniably succeed sadly up to this point in its chilling and racist effect who can forget the loathsome policy frankly it be reminiscent of century fascism of west dunbartonshire council in when its library ban new book volume print or publish in the jewish state yes it ban jewish book allied universal the parent company of sell business in israel follow pressure from the movement in series of council across england scotland and wales include leicester city council swansea city council and gwynedd council motion be pass ban import from israel they be inherently discriminatory and breach of our world trade organisation obligation those council be an embarrassment to this country and they should have be ashamed of their racism the supreme irony be that palestinian and israeli business in the region condemn the movement if anyone take the trouble to listen to the leader of those business they be instead seek bilateralism nearly palestinians be employ by israeli company their workforce receive high wage and enjoy great protection than elsewhere in the palestinian economy and its equivalent across the middle east regrettably the bds movement strengthen extremist and weaken moderate which be why it have even oppose peaceful coexistence project such as heartbeat and onevoice that bring israelis and palestinians together speak as former attorney general assure the house that the ban will not apply to individual or private organisation where they be not carry out public function that be testimony to the government respect for freedom of speech my right hon and learn friend have confirm that the bill will not apply to individual which be absolutely right and reassuring do he agree that it be also vital that the bill should not be see to interfere in any way with british government policy on the illegal activity by israeli settler in the occupied palestinian territories or indeed the sanction that the government have already apply against some of they be grateful for that question and think the secretary of state have answer it in the affirmative the bill will not change the uk approach to the middle east peace process or its position on settlement and nor should it whichever government happen to be in power it be only right that this house and the executive of this country make those sort of decision it will however strengthen the government diplomatic hand by rightfully return the power that have gradually be siphon away by local authority third tier council and the rest of it encourage peaceful coexistence and fulfil our manifesto commitment the bill will push back against the malevolent anti western force of hamas it be those that threaten our way of life and dissolve our security it be that movement that have be abet malicious international force in tehran and in the kremlin it be for those reason that the house not only have responsibility but fundamental duty to vote for the bill today rise order shall be call the secretary of state to wind up the debate no later than pm and the division will take place at pm as we have already hear the bill be largely an explicit reaction to the success of leicester city council in defeat legal attempt in to force it to end its boycott of good from illegal israeli settlement until israel comply with international law and end its illegal occupation arguably leicester stance have be thoroughly vindicate by event over the last few month during which israel have launch what south africa and many united nations body have call genocidal act on gaza which have also kill hundred in the west bank and the occupied palestinian territories while protect israeli settler as they beat and even kill palestinians try to go about their peaceful life while leicester and other council have be show to be do the right thing the government have find themselves yet again on the wrong side of the issue back the oppressor against the oppressed and give the israeli regime licence to kill ten of thousand many of my constituent back the council action and bitterly oppose israel war crime against palestinians and the illegal settlement whose proliferation have only accelerate the bill would prevent leicester and council like it from carry out the will of the voter who elect they tie the hand of the principled and enforce the will of government who have show that they prize geopolitical and economic end above the life of ten of thousand of innocent child woman teacher doctor aid worker and journalist it be bill design to hobble democracy and decency it subjugate local british democracy to the action and wish of foreign occupy power it be clearly also intend to circumvent the will of the court give that leicester comprehensively win its case against those try to overturn its boycott the conservatives appear to have little regard for south africa forensically compile case against israel which have invoke the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide at the international court of justice tomorrow that case will begin to be hear at the hague boycott divestment and sanction campaign last almost three decade be vital factor in the bringing down of south african apartheid south africa know all about the power of such peaceful but resolute campaign and be uniquely well place to bring case to the international court of justice invoke the genocide convention against israel however despite have only six week ago append their signature to gambia genocide case at the international court of justice against myanmar specifically because of myanmar treatment of child order the hon lady time be up there be about billion of local government spending in the uk which be very significant economic factor it be entirely right that in context where local authority have their remit within the public services social value act and the most advantageous tender rule introduce by the department for levelling up housing and communities they be able to ensure that that money be spend in way that fully express their ambition and the aspiration and view of their local community clearly we need to ensure and this be why support the bill so strongly that we have appropriate limit when there be risk that that will stray into cause real serious division and interfere with what be more appropriately national policy during my time at the local government association engage in good deal of effort work with the local government friend of israel group and observe the massive amount of bds lobbying of local councillor must pay tribute to our local government counterpart overwhelmingly despite that pressure they take the view that this be not an appropriate course of action and that in fact they should ensure that the concern and aspiration of their resident be front and centre rather than engage with international campaign that be both beyond their remit and at risk of conflict with the more broadly express objective of the country we should not forget this be why what the secretary of state say about retain the capacity for freedom of speech be so important that we have counterpart in local government who be specifically elect on an international platform for example many will recall justice for kashmir later the people justice party which become significant force in the politic of birmingham city council it be specifically elect on an international law issue later its member join the liberal democrats clearly community feel that the issue be so important that they be prepared to elect local councillor on that platform as member who represent diverse constituency and who have hear lot from people on both side of this debate want to finish by say that the incredibly bitter division that have arise about the bill and other issue be not see and feel by my constituent in day to day life when local muslim charity want base it find one in st john church when it want to raise fund to purchase its own permanent base the local synagogue speak out in support of that there be real sense of solidarity among our community regardless of faith or any other element of diversity in their background we need to ensure that bds which solely target the state of israel be restrict from inflict any further damage on our community this be bad bill both in intent and in the method that it adopt which be harmful to britain reputation around the world to human right to the proper conduct of state actor and corporation to citizen freedom of speech and to the action of public and elect body it have nothing to recommend it it aim to prevent any boycott and to affect the right of public body especially those that be elect to consider factor beyond commercial procurement and investment decision such as ethical factor which be often also commercially sensible factor it neuter the exercise of choice by pension fund employee and citizen it constrict the freedom of expression of religious group trade union and elect councillor it proscribe freedom of speech in draconian way which set an unfortunate precedent do my hon friend share concern that clause may contradict the higher education freedom of speech act and go against the academic freedom that be enjoy on university campus do not think it be lose on any hon member that the bill flatly contradict the government rhetoric on freedom of speech in most draconian way the so call exception require action to be unlawful before action can be take but we know how difficult it be for foreign state to have conviction against they in that way the government produce no evidence only assertion to support the provision the bill fail every test it weaken human right protection for persecute group around the world from the rohingya to the uyghurs it particularly fail israel and palestine it single out israel for special treatment in the word of daniel levy the respected commentator and former israeli negotiator when talk to mps early today the bill demand low not high standard of israel it do not distinguish between israel and the occupied palestinian territories single out israel and conflate israel and the opt break the consensus that both main party have maintain under successive government the subject of settlement often come up for example the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse and raise it in the urgent question early this week why at time when foreign office guidance advise against investment in settlement when the government have rightly speak out about settlement be reintroduce in gaza and rightly talk about sanction against violent settler do the government try to prevent through the bill any action from be take against settlement that be illegal under international law ban on settlement good or investment in settlement be not the same in any respect as boycott the government constantly dodge that issue and they need to deal with it the signal that they be send out be entirely contradictory hope that the bill will be defeat if it be not defeat and the reason amendment be not accept tonight hope that we will return to the issue in the other place and that the bill will not see the light of day before general election it certainly should not it would be shameful legacy even for this government thank my right hon friend the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities for bring forward this landmark bill the government should be applaud for take such strong action the bill intention to promote community cohesion should be endorse by all member of this house especially when antisemitism have sharply rise here in the uk since october the day that see the most death of jewish people since the holocaust in horrendous massacre commit by the hamas terrorist group jews worldwide have suffer anti jewish hatred in response to that slaughter before israel have even respond before israel and its ally could even fathom the full extent of the utter horror sow by hamas demonstrator fill the street of london to celebrate hamas attack flag fly in solidarity with our ally israel be vandalise in the two month from october to december the cst record antisemitic incident here in the uk dwarf the incident record in the first nine month of jewish business have be target as well as business with any small connection to jewish owner or the jewish state social media be rife with long list of company to boycott just because the bds movement do not like the people who run they intimidate protest have take place outside the like of zara and mcdonald young child have be taunt after enjoy their happy meal at the fast food chain and in one incident rodent be release into mcdonald chain in birmingham in my neighbouring constituency jewish student have be boycott with university society and sunday league football club refuse to play against jewish player and society bds target not only business but people it be appal that publicly fund body would give succour to such division and extremism yesterday hold westminster hall debate on the increase in antisemitic offence and be pleased to hear colleague commitment to stamp out anti jewish hatred on the street of the uk that commitment to reduce antisemitism will be help by vote in favour of this bill today the bds movement be antisemitic the movement be against peace and normalisation it call for the eradication of israel the world only jewish state the anti defamation league report that bds campaign frequently include antisemitic trope of jewish power and dual loyalty as well as accuse the jewish people and israel of be culpable for crisis across the globe bds activity advance by public body have legitimise and drive antisemitism in the uk by exclusively target israel and single out jewish people in the uk it have create division that our society need to be repair this be our opportunity to reassure the jewish community and show they our support bds unfairly target jewish business and people as well as palestinians who work for israeli company have speak about that before at time when we strive for peace in the middle east bds inflame tension and reject co existence stand in full support of this bill and of the jewish community here in the uk and abroad oppose this anti boycott bill on several point it be difficult to see its timing as anything other than cynical move by the uk government the secretary of state talk about support for community cohesion and peaceful two state solution but this bill do nothing to achieve either instead it will seriously curtail our civil liberty and undermine devolution if the volume of correspondence have receive on this bill be any indication the people of glasgow as ever see right through the tories my hon friend the member for glasgow south west chris stephens mention the granting of the freedom of the city of glasgow to nelson mandela in glasgow district council rename st george place as nelson mandela place as mark of the city solidarity with nelson mandela who be still imprison at the time the point be that the south african consulate be locate on the street and be force to use an address bear the name of south africa most high profile political prisoner this act of international resistance would simply not have be possible if this legislation have be in place in as at that time the uk government be still refuse to condemn apartheid who would want to speak with one voice when that be what the uk government be say on scotland behalf indeed even discussion of such an act would have be unlikely to take place under clause gag effect accord to liberty in practice public body seek to comply with the bill be likely to take step to distance itself from anything which suggest that it hold any political or moral view as to the conduct of foreign state for fear that it could be find to be in breach of the ban or the related prohibition on statement this legislation will undoubtedly alter the executive competence of scottish ministers and should be oppose by all of those who value devolution the provision in this bill be disproportionate and frankly unnecessary the bill hand sweep power to the secretary of state and the treasury to request information from the devolve administration to assess whether breach of the boycott ban or gagging clause have occur and to impose compliance notice this be huge overstep there be already significant protection in scottish procurement legislation for bidder from country where relevant trade agreement exist it be not clear what problem the uk government be try to fix with this bill bad the bill make it unlawful for scottish ministers even to publish statement that they would have act in certain way if not curtail by these measure the legislative consent memorandum publish by the deputy first minister describe this as an assault on democratic expression as we head into an election year the prime minister be affirm that the legacy he and his predecessor will leave behind will be one of democracy in tatter faith in public institution annihilate and our hard win right strip bare it be increasingly the case that the only hope leave for people in scotland to protect our democratic freedom be the hope of an independent scotland call miriam cates to speak until pm support this legislation but find it very sad that we need it when first hear about the holocaust as child at school be shocked be shock at the scale of the evil the horror of what happen to the jews and the fact that it could have be allow to happen as an adult have visit yad vashem auschwitz and the forest in poland where thousand upon thousand of jews include child be murder in cold blood by nazi soldier because they be jews no one walk away from those site in any doubt about the potential consequence of antisemitism but one thing be sure of before october be that that would never happen again surely the world this country at least be alive to the consequence of anti jewish attitude to the importance of not tolerate antisemitism and to the need for israel an israel that have the same right to exist and to defend itself as any other sovereign nation but now be not so convinced that we have learn the lesson of antisemitism polling show shocking level of support for hamas among young people here and in the united states that be be drive by social medium but it be also be foster order with the leave of the house call the secretary of state thank you very much mr deputy speaker would like to thank everyone who have speak on third reading include my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates who be articulate the vital importance of recognise where antisemitism begin and where it end also wish to thank those who speak powerfully from personal point of view my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers who have only recently return from israel of which she have be such strong friend and supporter and the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran our heart go out to not only her family but all those suffering in gaza at the moment wish briefly to address one misconception which be that this bill act as an effective restraint gagging clause on free speech the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter talk of faith group be silence and so on as the explanatory note make clear individual be in no way prohibit from express their view however disagreeable we might find it on the conflict in israel and gaza or from express view which would abhor that the state of israel should not exist what be clear be that only public authority not individual be govern by this bill the hon member for warwick and leamington matt western rightly draw attention to the importance of freedom of speech not least on campus and with academic freedom at its heart can reassure he and he can be reassure that whatever other misgiving he have about this bill it be not direct assault on the principle of free speech it be simply clearly and tightly draw in order to ensure that public body public authority can not abuse the position that have be vest in they as corporate body to more broadly undermine the foreign policy of the uk or particularly in this case as have be point out by number of hon member and indeed by the opposition front bench team to give succour to an explicitly antisemitic campaign again stress there will be different opinion across the house about the good way of secure israel and of secure freedom for the palestinians the fact that debate be so intense in this house reflect the care and passion that so many member bring to that debate however the bill be explicitly about make sure that citizen in the united kingdom who have be target by explicitly antisemitic campaign get the protection for which the organisation that stand up for they have be ask in the spirit of the community security trust the board of deputies of british jews and the jewish leadership council hope that as many member as possible on that point will the secretary of state give way will not as have only second leave hope that as many member as possible will feel that they can support the legislation more than one hour have elapse since the commencement of proceeding on the first motion the deputy speaker put the questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be conclude at that time order october question put that the amendment be make diane abbott debbie abrahams rushanara ali tahir ali rosena allin khan mike amesbury fleur anderson tonia antoniazzi jon ashworth hannah bardell paula barker margaret beckett apsana

of the inter faith network which feel more important and more necessary than ever before but also to be clear with the government that the network face imminent closure if they do not deliver on their july commitment to continue to provide funding here in the uk we be religiously diverse country the inter faith network be found in as way to advance public knowledge and mutual understanding of the teaching tradition and practice of the different faith community in britain include an awareness of both their distinctive feature and their common ground and to promote good relation between people of different faith in this country do not think anyone could find fault with that thank my hon friend for secure this debate be big fan of hounslow friends of faith because of the work it have do to bring community together particularly at time of heighten community tension that affect our community but also its other activity such as public health video on suicide prevention do my hon friend agree that the success of our local friends of faith or equivalent organisation be only possible because there be robust national organisation that support they in their work be really grateful to my hon friend for that intervention she be absolutely right and join she in pay tribute to hounslow friend of faith she have share really powerful example of where faith community can work together to deliver truly beneficial project and initiative that go deep into community perhaps in way that other statutory agency can not thank my hon friend for allow to follow the intervention make by my hon friend the member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury in the letter write to the secretary of state on the funding issue in may last year make the point that for almost four decade the inter faith network for the uk have be dedicate to increase understanding and co operation between people of different faith do my hon friend agree with charanjit singh chair of hounslow friends of faith make such contribution at time of tension when dialogue be most need as have be outline that we need the inter faith network to be support so that the national body can make sure that local organisation can do their vital grassroot work be once again grateful to my hon friend she have make really powerful case for the support that the national network provide to those local community group which then facilitate and host the dialogue that be not always easy but be absolutely vital we be all so grateful for the role and the benefit it then have within our community and how it bring people together at time when we most need that really important work to be undertake she be absolutely right the ifn member body include national faith community representative body from the buddhist christian hindu jewish muslim and sikh faith such as the board of deputies of british jews hindu council uk the muslim council of britain and the methodist council to name just handful in my own beautiful city of manchester incredible activity and inter faith work go on two week ago an article in the telegraph insinuate that the secretary of state for levelling up be concerned that the muslim council of britain be member of the inter faith network the muslim council of britain uphold british value and champion mutual respect and tolerance by come together through inter faith initiative it have long be trust group consult by many member of this house although the conservative government have consistently reject muslim civil society group do my hon friend agree that these attack on the inter faith network and the muslim council of britain be disappointing and take away from the important work that they do again be grateful to my hon friend he have provide another powerful example of how that inter faith work be so important in his part of the world greater manchester we be already hear example from right across the country know that the inter faith network be incredibly proud to host the muslim council of britain among its member know that my hon friend do great deal of work with the muslim council of britain long may that continue because it be an incredibly important partner in that dialogue and those conversation and again can carry some of those message deep into community in way that some other organisation can not my hon friend have make an incredibly powerful point as well as those have mention small but significant faith community be also represent include the quakers spiritualists and pagans the ifn member also include national and regional inter faith organisation local inter faith body and educational and academic body with an interest in multi faith and inter faith issue such as the university of salford faith centre and the cambridge interfaith programme first congratulate the hon lady on bring this forward speak to she beforehand she have bring forward subject that be close to her heart close to mine and believe close to the heart of everyone in the chamber as the hon lady will know chair the all party parliamentary group on international freedom of religion or belief we speak up for those with christian faith those with other faith and those with no faith because we encapsulate or try to encapsulate the very point that the hon lady be put forward be greatly supportive of this issue do the hon lady believe that the appointment of the special envoy for freedom of religion or belief be step in the right direction that have achieve great deal do she far agree that more can and should be do to show support for all faith all of they throughout the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and to recognise the sterling work carry out by the faith base group that the hon lady have refer to across the uk be really grateful to the hon member it would not be an adjournment debate without thoughtful and powerful contribution from he he do great deal of work in this area and be an enormous advocate for so many of the faith group that he bring together and be champion for in this place so pay tribute to he he make very good point in his intervention and thank he for that thank the hon lady for initiate this debate in harrow we certainly have very strong inter faith community that bring together and organise everyone from every religion in very positive way which be extremely helpful particularly at time of trouble however there have be criticism of the inter faith network not necessarily about its aim but about the way it have be run have have supportive comment from some element in harrow to say what wonderful job it be do but have also hear criticism of the way it be be run have she have have chance to examine those criticism and see whether there be any foundation to they whatsoever welcome the intervention as part of preparation for this debate have certainly look into any concern about and any criticism make of the inter faith network do not think it come as surprise that there be those who be uncomfortable about inter faith work that be actually where such partnership approach very much need ally in this place have look carefully at the way the network be organise and run and it appear to to be incredibly diligent have touch on its broad membership to which the hon gentleman also allude it be in demonstrate the critical mass of those different organisation be bring together that say to that nobody be do this work as successfully as the network be it be as effective as it be because so many people trust the work it be do and have buy into its aim and the way it conduct its business have be able to thoroughly satisfy myself as part of this process that it be do very good work be run very diligent way and be effective at what it do hope that in the rest of my speech can satisfy any further point to that effect what have restore my faith and confidence in the network be how it have respond to some of the criticism in very open way and by invite people into explain their view rather than get draw into what could be sectarian row or internecine strife on religious and other ground how it have react have in many way demonstrate the strength of the organisation again be very grateful to my right hon friend for that point some of the ifn publication such as the letter from the co chair to the editor of the telegraph only this week have be very candid and transparent it have be incredibly accountable in the work it do and the way it go about it so entirely agree with he on that point will my hon friend give way will give way but then will have to make some progress be it not clear that the kind of dialogue across faith divide that the inter faith network facilitate be more need at this moment than ever unless the government keep their promise to provide funding for this financial year we be go to lose that capacity entirely would that not be terrible tragedy my right hon friend be exactly right and thank he for make that point we need the work that the ifn do now more than ever if we lose that those friendship the trust bear out of that facilitated membership and the programme initiative and dialogue build up over year and year it will take an awfully long time to rebuild it even should funding perhaps become available in the future it would be go it would take lot time and effort to put it back together and that would be an absolute travesty as say we need that work now more than ever will make some progress all the ifn member be clearly list on its website those have mention give just hint of the range and number of member who proudly belong example of its work include lead programme of event to celebrate national inter faith week every november last year event which include parliamentary drop in engage more people than ever before the network publish practical guidance such as the look after one another the safety and security of our faith community guide in partnership with the department for levelling up housing and communities the home office the crown prosecution service the national police chiefs council the national fire chiefs council and the equality and human rights commission it have support the development and strengthening of local inter faith engagement through publication such as deep connection woman local inter faith initiative in the uk which be publish in march last year it bring together national faith community body to discuss topic such as faith and organ donation social care and hate crime and to share good practice on work with other faith community the ifn monitor and evaluate its work carefully to ensure that it be continue to be effective in enable an ever grow number of people in the uk to take part and benefit from strong inter faith relation to tackle ignorance prejudice and hatred link to religious identity to grow their religious literacy to develop bond of trust and friendship and to co operate on social action project for the benefit of wide society while so many mps will speak with great pride about represent diverse community as the former chair of all party parliamentary group on social integration recognise that we also need to provide opportunity for people to engage interact and learn about each other only when we nurture the relationship and friendship between different people do we establish trust and break down barrier the international backdrop to this inter faith work in the uk mean as we have discuss that it could not be more important the horror of hamas attack on israel on october follow by the utter devastation of israel response upon the people of gaza have inevitably impact on community here in the uk tell mama record anti muslim case between october and december sevenfold increase in report incident the community safety trust report that it have see an increase in anti jewish hate act of in the same period compare with the same period last year we know that we have to do more to promote and nurture trust understanding and respect between different community and this feel like time when we should be support not undermine inter faith work alongside that be aware that the government last publish their four year hate crime action plan in it be update in but it have not be update since nor have new plan be publish give these stark increase in unacceptable hate crime would be grateful if the minister clarify when we can expect some progress on that front from onwards the ifn have seek and receive grant funding from government that pay for its very small team of four people and to facilitate those incredibly important meeting since then fund from government under successive administration towards ifn work programme have be vital component of funding alongside other form of support such as donation from individual trust faith community other body and membership fee it be real setback when on march last year ifn receive letter from an official at the department for levelling up housing and communities say that further funding would not be give from april onwards like many mp here for this debate table write parliamentary question write to ministers and ask question in the chamber to query the logic of that and raise concern about how it have be handle however on july ifn receive letter from dluhc say that follow review by ministers of fund programme across the community and integration portfolio funding be now be offer to ifn the funding be offer in the form of access to underspend plus some new funding the letter explain that the money would be for use from july to march it would be subject to grant funding agreement and other condition despite the good effort of ifn and its ally include many of we here in parliament as thing currently stand the july to march grant funding agreement have not be provide and therefore that funding can not be access be reliably informed that when the present offer of funding be make last july the letter say that funding would not be provide beyond march so while the ifn continue to try to find alternative solution the truth be that its small team of staff have be give notice of redundancy the inter faith network be about to close it be on life support without clarity from the government about whether financial support will be forthcoming as we have touch on the inter faith network have critic think that be inevitable there will always be some who feel threaten by inter faith work but hope that the government would be proud to support it in address some of the criticism make it be worth stress that the co chair of the network have make clear that the ifn have long stand policy on the making of statement which preclude make direct comment on overseas event instead member work together on respond to the impact of any such event on community here in the uk it be worth say that anyone seek to criticise the inter faith network for fail to single handedly deliver world peace would be

apology and doubt anyone in the house do improve inter faith relation be even more important the conflict between israel and hamas and its impact on community tension in the uk have bring into sharp focus number of issue we must continue to encourage if at any time certainly now great understanding of different faith and belief to help foster well relationship and eliminate all form of intolerance or hatred be conscious that time be run out be the government go to honour the promise they make to the ifn in their letter of july last year will come on to that in moment if the right hon gentleman will just bear with the department be as per its letter of july which be send to harriet crabtree obe undertake variety of analysis with regard to the network hope my right hon friend the secretary of state will be make an announcement in the not too distant future but be afraid be not able to confirm that this evening stress again that the staff have be make redundant and be work their notice it will be such devastating tragedy if the money come too late and because of government inaction it be force to close just want to stress that point to the minister one more time let assure the hon lady that hear precisely what she have say will communicate that through to ministerial colleague and to official in the department who be deal with this matter she make the point powerfully and hear what she say any organisation that secure funding from the public sector be it in central or local government always value certainty and security be seize of that and of the time pressure to which she allude could the minister confirm whether the department have also be in touch with the ifn to say that there be go to be forthcoming announcement the letter of july set out to dr crabtree the funding criterion that letter have not be either rescind or update so it stand as the de facto communication if you will between the department and the network official and ministers will be work on that as say and the department hop to be able to make an announcement in pretty short order will the minister give way do not think can give way because think have about second leave before the end of the debate sign the cheque have neither chequebook nor pen to hand let say in closing that the work of the network be understand and the importance of that work be very clear the network be not the only body that provide forum and organisation to deliver inter community and inter faith discussion there be other but we hope to be able to make an announcement in due course
