conservative candidate weekend selection process and she say that she have hear one of the would be candidate opine that there be no point in become an mp unless one become minister one hop that he will learn quite lot before he ever get anywhere near this place if he do at all because plainly that be completely incorrect my colleague story remind of another one particularly in this week when we have finally right the long stand injustice of the infected blood scandal remember alistair burt stand around here talk about it at the end of the parliament and that be very recently in relation to the length of that scandal and the post office horizon scandal remember that as leave the public accounts committee in after some year tony collins the renowned computer journalist telephone about it luckily because be then involve in other matter to do with housing james arbuthnot and many other in this place take it up very seriously as we finally correct those wrong this week and be remind of other huge wrong over many decade such as the one correct by the work of those include andy burnham the hillsborough scandal and of other great work by many other great colleague be remind of another story consider the follow investigation into the allegation have reveal they to be mixture of unsubstantiated rumour incorrect information or repetition of early allegation which have be fully investigate and find to be unsupported by the fact question be that official statement aim at refute public disquiet about the efficacy of measure take against foot and mouth the reliability of the army rifle and radio set in kosovo and sierra leone government order that police should keep protester out of sight during the state visit of the president of china the possibility that bse can cross the species barrier to human the loss of an raf chinook helicopter and twenty five security personnel on the mull of kintyre the existence of illness collectively know as gulf war syndrome the export to iraq of machine tool capable of arm manufacture the circumstance surround the torpedoing of the belgrano the radiation sickness claim by some participant in the british atomic test of the which my hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr baron have so assiduously campaign on have even join by telephone surgery that have with my constituent because know that he know more about that matter than anyone else experiment carry out at porton down during the same period the denial of full pension to thousand of disabled ex servicemen and their widow for over fifty year or the loss of the carrier hms glorious and her two escort in the answer be that the statement be make by the ministry of defence in december to refute body of opinion that there might indeed be condition refer to as gulf war syndrome but it could just as well have be those other we all know this it be phenomenon that tim slessor in his book ministries of be quote from here refer to as the whitehall loop at its simple this be the closed circuit procedure where in reply to question ask of government department or minister the answer be put together by the very same civil servant whose early judgement be both the subject and the cause of the inquiry in the first place remember bump into simon burns who be at the time the health minister responsible for the national programme for it in the health service the npfit as it be call there be at least eight other ministers during that period track it closely from to would not recommend that anyone read it unless they have particularly masochistic disposition but in the book that write about government devote an entire chapter to the npfit where lovingly detail the many way in which what be then call connect for health manage to conceal information about how badly thing be go one day simon burns come up to in the tea room and say richard be sick and tired of be tell thing by you and then find out six month later that they be true the truth be that whether it be on the child support agency the criminal records bureau the tax credit scandal the rural payments agency scandal which have lead some farmer sadly to commit suicide the student loans company or the recruitment of junior doctor or many many other thing it be our constituent who through we as their member of parliament keep government honest they so often know far more about how government be actually work than the government themselves do that be why we need members of parliament who see their chief job as represent and protect their constituent and as require the government of the day of whichever political complexion to justify themselves and to keep explain their action be delighted to see my friend the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge back in her place of the various thing have do in the year have be here have not find any more consequential or more fun than the work we do together when be her deputy chairman on the public accounts committee between and she perform an extraordinary service and by the way write great book about it call to account which hon member may wish to read it say next in my note dame eleanor say but that be because when write they you be not in your seat madam deputy speaker as you yourself say yesterday mps of all party be the people who do not just shout at the television but get up and do something about it official report may vol it be an honourable estate it be an honourable calling it be one of the most important thing we can do it be worth devote oneself to to the point of exhaustion in order to keep our people free and to keep our government honest it say here self commission housing so suppose have well say word about that before conclude it be well know that for the past year or so since steer through the self build and custom housebuilding act have work very hard to try to implement that see the former prime minister my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may nod remember bounce up to she in the lobby many year ago when she be prime minister and say be it true that self build housing be discuss at cabinet this morning she say yes be sorry to report that there be still more to do see the hon member for manchester central lucy powell in her place nearly succeed in coax she into give evidence for the report do in for the then prime minister it be several prime ministers ago we have have quite few there be some excellent recommendation in there some of which have even be implement write to the current housing secretary on march with some detailed suggestion about how the recommendation might be implement will sit down in one or two minute but must place on the record my huge gratitude to the culture secretary my right hon and learn friend the member for south east cambridgeshire lucy frazer who when she be housing minister allow to introduce she to one of the nation lead planning silk silk to silk they talk through the issue and the thing be propose my right hon and learn friend say to her official what wrong with this and they could not provide she with an answer so that now sit on the statute book as section of the levelling up and regeneration act hope that future government will do their good to implement it and shall certainly be encourage they to do so in conclusion will just say this it have always be an article of faith to that there be no they just we if there be thing we want to fix and change it be we who have to do it as karl popper put it be not jealous of many thing but be jealous of the right hon member for barking because she be at the london school of economics when he be still teach there progress depend on we on our watchfulness and our effort on the clarity of our conception of our aim and on the reasonableness of their choice instead of pose as prophet we must be the maker of our fate it be great honour to be the last speaker on the back benches in this debate we have hear great emotion from many people and realise that it be such wrench for many people to leave parliament it have be an honour for all of we to serve but particularly for to serve as the member of parliament for hendon have be intimately involve in eight parliamentary election in the past year in many way in some seat it be no great achievement for someone to be elect it be in the marginal seat that it be an achievement we be the one that have change government thank my constituent in hendon for elect on four occasion at the last election receive vote the high number of conservative vote in the constituency since it sometimes irk when be first elect in that have majority of and over people have elect while there be other sit on different benches who have receive few vote than but have huge majority that do not feel quite right each and every member present will claim that their constituency be different from everyone else but hendon just like london be very diverse as someone who be bear and grow up in the south of england and never see person of colour until the age of be in hendon do not come as great shock to but it have teach huge amount have large jewish constituency large muslim constituency hindus the large chinese community outside of soho and manchester and the large iranian community in the whole country there be many issue that connect those different religious group which have always campaign on but there have also be huge amount of diversity in the local economy we have see huge development mean that the boundary change that have be apply will make difference under the previous conservative council when be councillor we introduce development that create the stonegrove estate the grahame park estate beaufort park west hendon upper fosters and the peel centre all make home for people in their local area and we should be very grateful for that as say have work on issue that have bring community together but the reason why have focus on the jewish community be that they be small number in this country about the number of muslims in this country be more like million and their voice will be hear by the different members of parliament in this place my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy raise issue of concern to many of my constituent issue about antisemitism and education but be pleased that this week lord pickles publish his report of the alderney expert review lay to rest the issue of concentration camp on british soil during the second world war my hon friend the member for brigg and goole have see other thing as well particular issue of concern to my constituent be that of israel which be understandable my hon friend and visit israel few week after the october attack we visit kfar aza and only wish that each and every member here in parliament could experience what we do have not say this before but my hon friend say to that he could not take picture during that day and tell he that we must just as bert hardy and other photographer go into bergen belsen and the other concentration camp say we have to go there and take picture so that the world know this really do happen we have have people say that it do not happen but can assure you madam deputy speaker that it do would be one of those hawkish members who want to see the issue in gaza resolve but do not believe ceasefire now would achieve that do not want to see any death on any side but when member say recently in debate that there have be civilian death try to challenge that we do not know how many of those people be civilian and how many be hamas fighter the foreign office say that it have not make prediction of that number but we do know that of people in gaza support hamas and hamas have get to be remove the decision of ireland norway and spain this week to recognise an independent palestinian state be not only wrong but allow the conclusion to emerge that terrorism work and we can not allow that it be simply impossible to recognise state that have never exist in any meaningful form so what exactly be those country recognise gently say to the premier of spain and ireland that they have never particularly recognise their minority community my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may say that you should never ask question in this place if you do not know the answer there be an occasion when ask the former prime minister now lord cameron if he would visit israel have to say that one of the good experience of be in parliament be the moment when visit lord cameron in his suite at the king david hotel we walk past the guy with machine gun guard he and we sit and drink whisky with he have to say that it be not that different from sit on the throne in saddam hussein palace in baghdad of course without saddam hussein and with whisky we have live through an extraordinary period in this parliament people often ask what be the good part of be an mp find that easy to answer it be the people particularly the constituent the story that they tell be sometimes heart wrench often annoying regularly amusing and always interesting have have great people work with in the constituency some political some not particularly think of people like val duschinsky and hugh rayner who work with in the hendon association as well as rabbi ginsbury simon rea and mushtaq rehman the respective leader of their religious community activist such as rupa monerawela richard nash and manubhai makwana have be great support to there be also individual such as ari leaman who have do so much for the teenage community and lorraine bushell for the grandparents association be ask what be the big mistake that have ever make as member of parliament that be easy to answer it be on the military action in libya when walk past my hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr baron and think how he go to explain why he vote against this but we not only create fail state but significantly contribute to the current immigration and asylum crisis that be my big mistake and bitterly regret it the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge say that be an mp be not what it use to be and she be correct several year ago be on boat and the skipper say what be it you say that you do for living say do before long one of the other crew say well it can be as bad as be member of parliament it be still vital to be member of parliament those who come after we will recognise that leave on one note that be particularly sad about for year have complain about sewage in our river and our sea not much have change over the last year all that have change be that the government have implement scheme for monitor the amount of sewage that go into our river and our sea the lib dems be make this central plank of their election campaign they should be advise that their mp vote against the super sewer here in london so they do not have good record on the issue in my opinion the eu directive be never fit for purpose so while minister have repeatedly claim that water quality be improve it be simply not it be the way that water quality be measure such claim lead to conclude that this be the same kind of behaviour by ministers that be witness in the contaminated blood scandal have be elect continuously for the last year for the last as the member of parliament for hendon have take huge toll on that be why have decide to step down but would not change it for thing be look forward to ameet jogia the conservative candidate take forward what we have achieve he be not only bear in the constituency but be local candidate have to thank my staff for the work that they have do over the last few year in this parliament alone they have undertake piece of casework have have good staff who have remain friend begin with laura pike hannah evans ness hirst and katherine toone and now with eamonn walsh george bose carolynne fisher and steve martin who volunteer and hilary smith who have be with for the last year they have really be true public servant as be say they be the one who ensure that the work be actually complete of course can not forget maximus decimus meridius my jack russell max who still attend parliament on occasion he have enable to concentrate on animal welfare issue so in the spirit of roman language say veni vidi vici
