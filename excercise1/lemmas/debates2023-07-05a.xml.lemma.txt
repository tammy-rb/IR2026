be pleased to respond to the debate when my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker the former schools minister and now the chair of the education committee say that he have apply for the debate welcome it because want good debate on further education despite the kind word of the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell do not know if he be quite the secret weapon would take with when have negotiation with the treasury but his point be well make hear lot of rhetoric from the shadow spokesperson the hon member for chesterfield mr perkins warm word butter no parsnip last year fe week report that labour can not commit to boost fe funding level the article go on to say that speak to fe week the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson say the economic landscape have change significantly and could not pledge any uplift in cash for further education or address the disparity between fe and high education funding until the economic outlook be clear so despite what the hon member for chesterfield say the opposition be not guarantee any uplift in further education funding thank the hon member for wirral west margaret greenwood for open the debate she be passionate about adult education be with she and understand the absolute importance of community learn have see that in my own constituency and champion it in the department will say more about adult and community learn later in my remark but look at all the programme together the skill boot camp the level offer multiply and adult apprenticeship we be spend well over billion my hon friend the member for waveney peter aldous as well as the hon member for wirral west raise the issue of community learning which have actually increase over the past year if we look at the key focus we will see that in the academic year learner participate in community learn course compare with in the academic year that be an increase of have other figure that could quote but that do not mean that everything in the garden be rosy we be do lot of work to try to support adult and tailor learning which will go on to discuss bit later in my speech be experience bit of déjà vu here this time last year believe that be the chair of the education committee lead the estimate debate and my hon friend the member for worcester be answer it what we say here be think touché what would say to he be that absolutely he have make valid case for funding for further education as have many other member will go on to talk about that bit later in my remark also think that it be important that we do not paint just partial picture we should look at the uplift in level funding the million that we be spend on institutes of technology the million spending on high technical qualification which be now be teach in more than institution the billion that we will be spend on apprenticeship by the up to million that be be spend on multiply and the many million of pound be spend on boot camp billion and billion of pound be be spend on skill which be absolutely right it be right too to make the case for ever more resource always champion more resource but it be important to paint the whole picture not just partial one there be many good thing happen and it be fair to acknowledge that the hon member for twickenham munira wilson raise the issue of btec as do my hon friend the chair of the select committee he be resolute on this so will be quite resolute in return btec have already be delay they have already be review and be be review there will be significant number of btec that remain we have specifically introduce the level transition year the whole purpose of which be to prepare those student for level because as be rightly say by my hon friend the member for great grimsby lia nici level be hard but there be now level transition year and more than institution be teach it and there will be another along the way to prepare student importantly we be remove some btec and other qualification that have low uptake or poor progression the hon member for twickenham mention the tourism qualification shall write to she with the detail and the figure shall also come on to childcare in bit because of the brilliant speech by my right hon friend the member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom as be say though we be remove level that have low uptake or not great progression or that significantly overlap with other level the whole purpose of this be that we have create employer lead qualification through our apprenticeship reform the level and the high technical qualification be all employer design with the institute for apprenticeships and technical education be proud to legislate for they in my last stint in this role employer will be able to develop new qualification for example if they want to they could develop new tourism qualification there be another important issue which have come up time and again have say that some btec will remain recognise that disadvantaged student be do some of these btec but we go down very dangerous road if we say that we want to keep some qualification because disadvantaged student do they and the other one the middle class and everybody else can do that be dangerous road because do not want to have two tier qualification some for the disadvantaged and other for the middle class and the well off what want and what have devote my whole parliamentary life to be to develop state of the art world beat vocational and technical qualification that be as good as if not well than level that be what be important that be how would respond politely but robustly to my hon friend the chair of the select committee first as say significant number of btec remain and will remain there be new qualification that can be develop so that those who do not pass will be able to do some other qualification at level or they may want to do level or level apprenticeship instead there will be option for those people but we could make the same argument about those people who fail level we should not just have one rule for level and another rule for those do level will come on to funding because every hon member have raise that the hon member for sheffield brightside and hillsborough gill furniss talk about it and be pleased that she have have more million invest in sheffield city college my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton be thoughtful as always we have talk lot about skill over the year and reiterate that we be champion quality qualification which will address the skill deficit and introduce lifelong learning through the lifelong loan entitlement the hon member for stretford and urmston andrew western again talk about funding will come on to that and be happy to write to he about the specific issue that he raise regard trafford college be pleased to meet my hon and learn friend the member for eddisbury edward timpson and the principal of reaseheath college land college have be beneficiary of important capital funding and know the college have receive more than million say in that meeting that would work with my hon and learn friend on the issue he have raise and will continue to do so as much as possibly can the hon member for twickenham talk about the skill wallet and we do have difference here have sympathy with many of the thing she say and genuinely admire she for her knowledge of education and skill but we look at the skill wallet and as understand it it give every adult to spend on training but with incremental payment start with at age at age and the final at age that would mean that learner would be constrain by when the funding become available we want to be fair to student and fair to the taxpayer our lifelong loan entitlement will be transformative because everyone will have access to up to that they can take any time up to the age of there be entry point and they can do short course or module of course have nothing but incredible admiration for the way my right hon friend the member for south northamptonshire champion early year have good news for she because when find out she be on the list to speak in this debate want to be sure about what we be do on early year skill as my department official who be watch will know to let my right hon friend know what be go on there be lot the first ever national professional qualification in early year leadership cohort begin in october and the second cohort commence in february the employer trailblazer group have develop level and level apprenticeship but we now have level apprenticeship and we fund more than childcare course through our free course for job offer some learner start level in education and childcare in september and there be load of early year high technical qualification there be mass go on so we will have the train workforce that she passionately and rightly talk about right across that sector my right hon friend the member for bexleyheath and crayford sir david evennett have great experience and wisdom he too talk about funding and he will know that his college think it be the london south east colleges group have have million since think the shadow minister have also have million in capital funding for chesterfield college in his constituency again that be brilliant investment by the government that no doubt he will be celebrate to the rafter have mention the right hon member for hayes and harlington appreciate the way in which he say what he do we have spending constraint but will talk more about those in moment my hon friend the member for waveney speak powerfully about the skill revolution in his area my hon friend the member for great grimsby make brilliant speech there be lot that agree with on the math to issue be one of those people who have fear of math pass my math level but it take three month and second time around be slightly dyspraxic it be nightmare it be wrong that be tell that would never have to do it again we should have practical numeracy basic numeracy times table and so on and what call numerical literacy so that people can read bill and understand budget that would help those who have difficulty of course any math teaching should promote career in mathematic think that the prime minister be right we must have math to along the principle that he set out in his speech absolutely believe in that the experience of my hon friend the member for great grimsby be clear to see this be an estimate day debate so we have to talk about fact and figure the dfe resource budget be about billion an uplift of more than billion since the spending review and billion be directly link to apprenticeship and further education apprenticeship be key rung on what call colleague have nicely quote it back at ladder of opportunity we redesign the programme in partnership with industry there be now accredit route to more than occupation from entry level to expert government funding for apprenticeship will reach billion by as have mention and that money be reach the economy the hon member for twickenham mention the apprenticeship budget we spend of the apprenticeship budget and let we not forget that we send hundred of million to the devolved authority so the levy be be use can give she raft of quote from business that be supportive of the levy the opposition quote one or two business here and there that perhaps want it to be skill levy but have to disagree with the hon lady and the shadow minister skill levy would mean no apprentice or diluted number of apprentice we be spend billion of pound on skill have already give the figure on that as the chair of the education committee my hon friend the member for worcester mention the association of colleges have call for of the apprenticeship levy to be spend on apprentice at level and who be below the age of make up of start in of start be at level and provide an entry level springboard into work contrary to the bad news set out by the shadow spokesman we have have increase in apprenticeship achievement in the academic year that be what count achievement the who achieve get good job when they finish their apprenticeship there be more start in than in we be push and encourage more degree apprenticeship they be brilliant route up the ladder we be now put in million over the next couple of year it be million previously to encourage provider to take up more student for degree apprenticeship my goodness what brilliant visit we have to the college in the constituency of my hon friend the member for loughborough jane hunt anyone who want an example of level success should go to loughborough college where state of the art level be be teach brilliantly include healthcare level create pipeline for future nhs worker and an institute of technology be be build it be an honour to lay the groundwork as mention we be spend million on institute of technology around the country of which there be already they be the rolls royce of further education in collaboration with high education and big and small business and an example of the government commitment to skill and of the investment in the skill that we need for the future sadly understand that the principal be leave loughborough college but be sure that the college will find principal who be just as brilliant as she to take over mention the high technical qualification and new and exist level and we have the level yes there be delay in some of they but we want to get they right we have provider across the country and student start level in that be more than double the figure we will roll out level in so that more young people can benefit from those high quality qualification more than of student achieve pass
