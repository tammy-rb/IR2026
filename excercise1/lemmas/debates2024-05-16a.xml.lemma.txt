invaluable ours host load of event include meeting of the brownies and the girl guides be make representation to get living the developer responsible for that decision it have frankly be responsible for whole bunch of questionable decision over recent year include during the clad scandal and on exorbitant service change can we have debate in government time on how the action of developer have undermine the olympic legacy and fail local resident we have see many injustice debate in this house just today we have see the injustice of the waspi woman in recent week we have speak about the infected blood scandal and more recently the post office scandal tonight we be go to debate another scandal the mineworker pension scheme scandal some of the united kingdom be on top of old coalmine so have hop that of this chamber would be full tonight but it be not maybe there be few reason for that the issue have be debate lot in this place both before and since come into parliament so maybe certain mp be get bit feed up of say the same old thing but we will keep try start in the pit in the go to work at sutton colliery in north nottinghamshire with my dad paul anderson he be rope fitter and go to work with he underground have good time work with my dad and my friend at sutton colliery which be family pit it be small coalmine with small coal seam and difficult condition it be family pit where brother work with their brother dad and grandad it be proper community but like all coalmine there be tragedy underground at sutton colliery in there be methane explosion and sadly five man lose their life know some of the friend family and descendant of the people who die then go on to cresswell colliery in north derbyshire to do my coalface training it be another family pit where again man work with their son and brother work with their brother and it too be ting with tragedy in there be fire at cresswell colliery and sadly man and boy lose their life the mine rescuer have to seal the pit off underground to save the colliery so that it could produce coal again they seal off some of the old working and leave the man inbye because there be no chance of save they but when they take the stop down just few month later the man be on the other side some of they have scratch their name into the wall it be terrible and this sort of thing be hard to explain to people who have not work down coalmine it be very tight knit community and people work in difficult condition have just over year of work in awful condition but my grandad charlie have year down the coalmine and finish up at norton hill colliery it would have be year but he take break between and and go to fight hitler then he come back and go straight back down the pit the follow week when he finish in the pit in he get tankard certificate quid and meagre pension imagine that as miner we know about the risk underground when we go down the pit every day since mining start in this country in the over man woman and child have die in the coalmine so we know the risk we know there be always chance that something might happen but these be the risk we take the miner take these risk for simple reason to earn wage put food on the table and make sure their kid be well dressed in when be still work in the pit they be privatised in my area it be rj budge mining that take over the pit at that time big bone of contention be what be go to happen with the mps or the mineworker pension scheme it be probably one of the rich pension scheme in the world at that time and be worth hundred of million if not billion in today money it be always accept that there would be split in favour of the miner when the then government sit around the table with the trustee to make an offer to guarantee the mineworker pension scheme we automatically surmise that there would be split which would have be fair but at the last minute it end up be and depend on who you talk to whether it be the trustee at the time or the mining organisation involve in campaigning nobody can get to the bottom of it take it or leave it deal the government at the time never undertake proper financial risk assessment or have actuarial advice on the split we can never get to the bottom of that it be simple take it or leave it when be work at the pit with my friend we never really have say in this can not remember any man work with underground be happy with the split because we know how rich the pension fund be thirty year on from successive labour and conservative governments have not pay single penny into the pension scheme which be cash cow they have take billion out of the scheme some mining group say the sum be near to billion but will take the figure have here in just the last three year the government have take more than million out of the surplus which be lot of money this be miner money in effect the treasury guarantee be an insurance scheme it guarantee to make up the shortfall and pay the bonus and so on if there be not surplus but can not think of any insurance scheme anywhere in this country or the world that have never have to pay out in year not penny have come from the treasury or the taxpayer to top up the mineworker pension scheme think that be bit of scandal and so do my mining community
