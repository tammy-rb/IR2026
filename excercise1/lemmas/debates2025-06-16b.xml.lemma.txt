student what standwithus uk set out in its report into antisemitism and support for terrorism at british university be source of national shame it be high time that we heed the stipulation in the international holocaust remembrance alliance definition that so call anti zionism be nothing less that anti jewish racism urge the secretary of state to reiterate that crucial point and ask whether she will commit to enact the report important recommendation include introduce framework of escalate financial penalty for university that fail to safeguard their jewish student from such hateful intolerance and extremism be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise that incredibly important issue that we as government take extremely seriously because no student should be subject to antisemitism on university campus or in any place in our education system that be why we have commit million of funding to address antisemitism in education half million pound of that have already be award to university jewish chaplaincy to support student welfare on university campus that run alongside the new condition of registration from the office for students that will ensure we protect student from harassment and discrimination give my experience of work with the holocaust educational trust in school in mansfield ask the secretary of state to confirm that the history of the holocaust will be teach in school follow the passage of the children wellbeing and schools bill which the conservatives oppose can give that confirmation to my hon friend join he in pay tribute to the holocaust

undertaking ahead of the conclusion of the curriculum and assessment review to ensure that all our young people learn and understand the lesson of the holocaust which be more important now than be ever the case employer national insurance contributions school redundancies what estimate she have make of the potential impact of increase in employer national insurance contribution on the number of redundancy in school be pleased to inform the house that the government be over third of the way to meet our plan for change milestone compare to last year we have over more teacher in school and over more in training whether on private school tax break or on teacher recruitment and retention the conservatives scaremongere be not come to fruition but they continue to talk down our education system to be disconnect from reality and to be wrong may update the minister who seem to be very complacent on this issue in harrow where have be out to see many of our school since we pass the resignation date vacancy be not be fill and many staff feel threatened with be make redundant from our school that be not good for our child or for the education system all the school say that these issue be because of the national insurance hike that have take place which be penalise school budget will the minister take action to ensure that money be provide to enable school to recruit the staff that we need there be absolutely no complacency on the government benches we see complacency over the past year and we be pick up the piece and fix the system we have commit significant funding to school we be provide mainstream school and high need setting with over million to support they with increase in national insurance contribution at the spring budget we announce additional funding to the tune of billion per year by compare with we be support school to get on and improve education create excellent outcome for every child and we will continue to do so very much welcome the extra teacher that labour plan for change have see in our school but school support staff be just as important as teacher in ensure the delivery of the well run school we have in ealing southall will the minister update the house on progress in reinstate the school support staff negotiate body which be abolish by the conservative party in my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to the fantastic work do in our school not only by teacher but by all school staff one of the first thing we do in government be to introduce legislation to bring back the school support staff negotiate body to ensure that those staff be recognise for their vital work and that they be part of the conservation about term condition and pay that process be under way in parliament and we be in strong negotiation on continuous basis through our improve education together plan which allow stakeholder to get around the table call the shadow minister the last conservative government add extra teacher although we would never know it from the minister answer there be few teacher in our school than last year labour promise more teacher but it be ignore the loss of primary school teacher because apparently they do not count the loss of teacher be not coincidence the confederation of school trusts and the association of school and college leaders have show that school have be leave up to short in compensation for the national insurance rise will ministers finally admit that they break their promise to fully compensate school for that tax rise think the hon gentleman math need bit of work he will know as well as anybody that pupil number in primary be down and keep on fall yet recruit and retain expert teacher be crucial to this government mission to break down the barrier to opportunity that be why we have commit to recruit additional expert teacher and we be target they at the sector in which they be most need it be not the government fault that those on the opposition front bench do not seem to be able to add up or pay proper attention smartphone in schools if she will take step to stop the use of smartphone in school if she will take step to stop the use of smartphone in school mobile phone have no place in our school government guidance be clear that school should prohibit the use of device with smart technology throughout the school day if pupil fail to follow those rule school have the power to confiscate device to ensure that classroom be free from disruption school with smartphone ban be rat higher by ofsted and their student achieve well gcse result all the evidence show the benefit of ban smartphone in school but the government be simply issue non statutory guidance and pass the buck do the minister not understand the evidence do he need more evidence or do he not trust the government to be able to implement ban on smartphone in school will take no lecture from the conservatives on this issue when they be in government they exclaim that the same guidance mean consistent approach across school have to ask if they be wrong then be they wrong now mobile phone in classroom be link to disruptive and violent behaviour do the minister agree that mobile phone should be ban in all school so that child be focus on their education not glue to instagram and tiktok repeat my early answer legislation be not necessary because school already have the power to ban phone in school and the majority have choose to do so from speak with former teaching colleague and local school leader know that the impact that powerful school policy to restrict the use of smartphone and keep they out of school can have be really clear fantastic work have be do on that include by hitchin boy school in my constituency but sadly not all school be meet this high standard in ensure that they have robust and well enforce policy how can we ensure that we be spread this good practice to every school across the country would the minister love to visit hitchin boy school in my seat so that he can see at first hand the fantastic work it be do think that show that school actually have the power to do this it be worth say that everyone include parent school and provider be responsible for ensure that child be aware of the importance of internet safety we encourage school to consult and to build on that support with parent to develop policy that work in the context and that keep child and young people safe call the shadow secretary of state the secretary of state may dismiss ban smartphone in school as gimmick but teacher health professional and parent be all call for action to reduce child screen time every day we have new evidence of the harm that screen be do so why be the education secretary ignore that and press ahead with screen base assessment for child as young as four from september do she accept that that be normalise screen time for young people which be the opposite of what we should be do be that all that the right hon lady can go on after year the conservatives break the education system as say guidance be already in place for school and the majority of school already have ban on mobile phone use school estate what step she be take to help improve the school estate what step her department be take to improve the quality of school building this government be commit to sustained investment to improve the school estate in order to give child the good start in life we will increase annual capital investment for maintenance in real term rise from billion this financial year to around billion in over million more than in that be on top

offer in england but the public childcare now campaign point out that nearly two third of the fund school be part of multi academy trust while we be fortunate not to have academy in wales concern remain that this model encourage privatisation reduce accessibility and undermine staff pay and condition contribute to great educational fragmentation what assurance can the minister offer that expand entitlement without invest in public infrastructure will not exacerbate these issue be delighted that so many academy be take part in our school nursery programme academy drive innovation across our system and be an important part of the system we have of course it be the last labour government who first bring about the academy programme to drive up performance in our school and to make sure that all our child get brilliant education sadly we know that after year of the tories far too many child include in our most disadvantaged community do not get the education they deserve that be why our school white paper later this year will make it reality once and for all that they do swallow dell primary in welwyn garden city be fantastic school have have the privilege of meet the leadership team who be ambitious for every single child they have state nursery as part of the school but they be seek to expand and unfortunately their bid be reject in the last round be passionate and hopeful that this school might be able to benefit from the million of additional funding not least because one in three child attend swallow dell be eligible for free school meal my right hon

visit keresley newland and be delighted that it be take part in our school base nursery programme we be determined to make sure that every child get the good start in life we know that the early year be crucial and that be why we have set an ambitious target of make sure that record number of child at the end of the early year foundation stage be ready for the next step on their journey through the school system the last government make all kind of promise to parent but they do not fund they in fact they leave behind huge black hole in the public finance interruption the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott should know that well than most because she be in the treasury recently visit the excellent matchborough first school in my redditch constituency to meet headteacher lynn briers it be select as one of the first school in the country to receive substantial funding to transform unused classroom into much need nursery space see at first hand the difference that that funding will make can therefore cheekily ask the secretary of state to confirm when the next round of funding will be available so that we can deliver even more of these excellent project to support school and family in redditch it be because we know the benefit that primary base nursery can bring often work with the private voluntary and independent sector that we be determined to move as fast as we can to deliver the next phase look forward to discuss that far with my hon friend be delighted that family in redditch and right across the country will benefit from the expansion of free school meal eligibility to all family in receipt of universal credit lift child out of poverty and put money back in the pocket of parent do the secretary of state monitor the number of private nursery closure if so can she tell we how many have close since the budget yes we continue to keep that under review especially ahead of the further expansion of childcare in september the figure will be publish in the usual way and we will make sure that we have the workforce there to deliver on the commitment that have be make say to the hon lady that in addition to almost double the early year pupil premium we put in place million expansion grant to make sure that ahead of the further roll out in september all our early year setting can deliver the place that be need in my constituency there be more than active case involve child with special educational need many of which involve education health and care plan that be either deny or issue in such poor state that they contain the wrong name and describe the wrong condition and therefore offer completely inappropriate package of support give that surrey county council have the high number of tribunal case against it every year most of which be lose may ask whether the secretary of state intend to reduce the right associate with ehcp and whether she will do what so many parent ask about and launch an immediate investigation into the council and its compliance with its legal obligation the hon gentleman have raise number of important question will certainly look into the issue relate to surrey that we have discuss previously and will then come back to he as for support for child with special educational need and disability he have make the case for reform very precisely the current system be simply not work and the government be determined to ensure that child get more timely early support and that we have system that be base much more on need as part of the process lead to the school white paper that will come later in the year be engage with parent campaigner and other and would be more than happy to discuss the matter far with liberal democrat colleague in order to understand their concern this morning in my constituency meet the chief executive of the early years alliance its laindon nursery be face closure not because of fall demand but because it be be hammer by the national insurance tax rise how can the secretary of state talk about expand provision when nursery after nursery in my constituency and across the country be be push over cliff edge by this labour government too recently meet the chief executive of the early years alliance and will always be open to discuss the challenge face by the sector but let convey to the right hon gentleman the point that make to the chief executive we be invest billion in early year education as well as almost double the early year pupil premium and provide million expansion grant to support setting ahead of further roll out in september the right hon gentleman and the conservative party make load of promise to parent at the time of the last general election but they do not fund they they do not ensure that the workforce would be there and they leave we with the black hole in the public finance that this government be turn around in the last couple of month have be speak to lot of nursery provider across my constituency about these issue and the thing that come up again and again be small business rate relief the secretary of state department have already reply say that nursery can claim the relief but nursery have to have few than child to qualify and the average number in my constituency be those nursery be not eligible and the national insurance and consumable change be cripple they so they be now consider not take on government fund child what should they do know that the under secretary of state for education my hon friend the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan have be in touch with the hon lady recently to discuss this matter far and personally will happily look far into the case that she have raise we be invest record sum in early year education and work with the sector to deliver the place that be need that be big challenge because the last tory government do not leave behind plan to deliver those place send support child without an ehcp what step she be take to support child with special educational need and disability who do not have an education health and care plan parent right across the country know that the tories leave behind send system that be in the word of the last tory education secretary lose lose lose labour will restore parent confidence with support first approach prioritise early intervention and inclusive support in mainstream school to address need before they escalate we will not be remove effective support but we will also expand school capacity to deliver consistent high quality provision to help child thrive with timely and effective support in the last month have visit nearly all the school in my constituency and wherever have go have ask whether people understand why the number of child with special educational need have be go through the roof have receive various explanation such as lockdown diet social medium drug in pregnancy parenting increase awareness and over medicalisation be the department do any research on what be cause this phenomenon so that we can treat the cause and not just the symptom my department and the department of health and social care be keen to understand some of the driver identify by the hon gentleman know that he come to this discussion in good faith but some people include reform members of parliament sometimes do not approach it in responsible way think we need to tread with great deal of care when we approach and discuss this subject not least because it be welcome change in our society that we now well understand where child have additional need the challenge of course be that the hon gentleman party do not put in place the support that be require both to identify and to support child with special educational need and disability call the chair of the education committee one of the big challenge affect the delivery of support for child with special educational need and disability be the extent of local authority fund deficit they be currently deal with through the statutory override which allow local authority to set balanced budget without account for their send deficit give that the statutory override expire in march do the secretary of state agree that white paper in autumn provide far too little time for the government to implement meaningful change without extend the override far and when do she expect local authority to be able to have the certainty that they need to plan for the come financial year agree that in addition to long term reform which the white paper will deliver it be imperative that we take action now in order to make sure that the school system well cater for child with wide range of need that be why we have invest million to support council to create more specialist provision in mainstream school have see some fantastic example right across the country and we need to see more on the precise question about the statutory override we want to make sure that council be well support through the process and we will set out our position very soon one of the good way to support autistic child in school be for teacher to go through mandatory training and to understand well the challenge that face by neurodiverse people how be the neurodivergent taskforce progressing and will the government bring in mandatory training for new teacher we be introduce more training on send for new entrant to the profession that will take effect from september but there be more that we need to do include support teacher and staff already work in our school that be part of the work that the group have under way and we will set out more through the white paper welcome the right hon gentleman interest in the issue know he care very much about make sure that all child include those who be neurodivergent have the support that they need to thrive which be what this government be determined to deliver thank the secretary of state for her comment about the need to address the topic of send with great sensitivity as we risk stigmatise entire family and generation who be affect so adversely by this issue in rural constituency like suffolk coastal the send crisis be incredibly severe and acute for many reason be the secretary of state look at the decline in population that we face in many of our rural primary school and at how that extra capacity could be huge resource and opportunity in tackle the send crisis agree that in area where we be see space opening up in the school estate it be allow we to do thing like open more school base nursery it also provide we with the opportunity to deliver more specialist provision in mainstream school have see some brilliant example right across the country of where that can be deliver have also see brilliant example that involve the mainstream sector work together with the specialist sector to improve training for staff in order to improve provision overall this be big challenge one that many member from across the house want to see put in much well place we will all have hear anguished tale from parent who have have to fight incredibly hard for the support that their child need alongside that we will all have hear that many staff in our school feel that they currently lack the training and support they need to ensure that all child be able to thrive and this government be determined to change that call the shadow minister ask whether the government be plan to restrict ehcp so that they apply only to child in special school the government strategic adviser on send christine lenehan recently say think to be honest that the conversation we in the middle of be she correct to say that ministers be consider that or not we do need to think differently about the system that we have inherit from the conservative party one that member from across the house recognise just be not work this be not about take away support for family or child it be about make sure that there be much early identification of need and that support be put in place much more rapidly include ahead of any formal diagnosis urge the shadow minister to reflect and to show bit more humility about the terrible state of what he and his party have leave behind system that be adversarial and fail child and in which child with special educational need and disability do not get the excellent educational outcome that should be the right of every child in this country he should reflect on his total failure level apprenticeship fund what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of change to funding for level apprenticeship on people age and over

policy to cease funding for level apprenticeship for those over the age of can the minister tell we what plan be in place to ensure that the people support all of we and all our constituent be give essential training and support more particularly what discussion have she have with the secretary of state for health and social care about the impact of this decision on our nhs we be encourage more employer include the nhs to invest in upskille their staff who be over year old and to deliver level apprenticeship where they benefit those business and individual it will be for employer to determine the most appropriate training and there be other training opportunity available at level include non apprenticeship route our reform will support new training opportunity and up to foundation apprenticeship start apprenticeship start participation and achievement be all up under labour and we be continue to go much far welcome the government plan to create those training opportunity for young people include these high level apprenticeship however we know that there be significant shortage of those able to provide training and mentorship with only of to year old employ do the minister agree that there be an opportunity to retrain old worker so they can pass on their experience to the next generation my hon friend be absolutely right that we continue to support and train adult and many adult with seniority in their profession will continue to offer excellent support mentoring internship and guidance to young apprentice the change we have put in place will enable apprenticeship opportunity to be rebalance towards young people and will create more opportunity for those enter the labour market call the shadow minister ministers recently announce that they be ax level apprenticeship strangely they make the announcement during recess and also strangely it be only the day after the announcement that they finally answer my parliamentary question from april reveal that they be make cut in those apprenticeship this be blow huge hole in the nhs workforce plan lead to shortfall of nurse if ministers will not listen to the many employer say that this will make it much more difficult for people who be not so well off to get into the profession will they at least rule out cut level apprenticeship next can reassure the shadow minister that level apprenticeship be core part of our offer and we will continue to fund they also say politely to he that we will take no lesson from liz truss previous health minister that government leave our nhs on its knee and we be have to rebuild it from its foundation again call the liberal democrat spokesperson the number of health visitor in england have reach an all time low with just remain and there be forecast shortfall of community nurse by the department own skills england sectoral report show that the health and social care sector face the high vacancy rate at have there be any specific

the department of health on nhs workforce planning skills england be take pivotal and active role also of the million worker in critical demand occupation which include the nhs the majority require qualification low than degree level we be rebalancing opportunity towards young people whose rate of apprenticeship start have fall more dramatically than the overall decline over the last decade to create more opportunity for young people we will need to prioritise public funding towards those at the start of their work career and at the low apprenticeship level rather than those who be already in work with high level of prior learning or qualification outdoor education national curriculum what recent assessment her department have make of the adequacy of outdoor education provision in the national curriculum it be important for young people to enjoy the benefit of spend time in nature as part of balanced curriculum beyond the curriculum the department be also work on an enrichment framework to support school in develop their offer which include variety of outdoor education opportunity our national education nature park initiative also aim to support young people wellbee and

suggestion adoption child in foster care what step she be take to reduce the time take for the adoption of child in foster care where adoption be the right option for child it need to happen without delay and early permanence placement be crucial way to offer child stability labour believe that child grow up in our country deserve the good start in life which be why we have provide in funding for adoption england to promote the practice the children wellbeing and schools bill represent the big overhaul of child social care in generation and it be shame that opposition members oppose it thank the minister for that response as an adoptive parent and foster carer know the transformative effect that early permanence can have on the life of child in care it be not right for every child or for every parent but adoption agency could make much wide use of it would the minister be willing to meet and adoption charity to discuss how we can maximise the benefit of early permanence thank my hon friend for raise this important topic he be champion for child in cannock chase agree that we should continue to promote early permanence adoption england have publish national standard to promote and shape early permanence practice across the country regularly meet the organisation my hon friend have mention but be more than happy to meet he too adoptive parent right across my constituency be

in government funding this year the government be transform mental health service for child in reading west and mid berkshire and across the country hire more staff deliver more talk therapy and get waiting list down through our plan for change so that child can have the good possible start in life what be the principal difference between this government groundbreake plan to introduce mental

friday seven man be find guilty of commit the most horrendous crime in rochdale between and they be convict of treat teenage girl as sex slave repeatedly rap they in filthy flat alleyways and warehouse the perpetrator include taxi driver and market trader of pakistani heritage and it have take year to bring they to justice pay tribute to the incredible bravery of the woman who tell their story and fight for justice for all those year they should never have be let down for so long the sexual exploitation of child by groom gang be one of the most horrific crime child as young as ply with drug and alcohol be brutally rap by gang of man and disgracefully let down again and again by the authority that be mean to protect they and keep they safe these despicable crime have cause the most unimaginable harm to victim and survivor throughout their life and be stain on our society five month ago tell the house that our most important task be to stop perpetrator and put they behind bar can report that that work be accelerate arrest and investigation be increase ask police force in january to identify case involve grooming and child sexual exploitation allegation that have be close with no further action more than case have now be identify for formal review and expect that figure to rise above in the come week let be clear perpetrator of these vile crime should be off our street behind bar pay the price for what they have do far rapid action be also under way to implement recommendation of past inquiry and review include the seven year independent inquiry into child abuse recommendation that have sit on the shelf for too long in the crime and policing bill we be introduce the long overdue mandatory reporting duty which call for more than year ago as well as aggravate offence for groom offender so that their sentence match the severity of their crime early this year also commission baroness louise casey to undertake rapid national audit of the nature scale and characteristic of gang base exploitation specifically ask she to look at the issue of ethnicity and the cultural and social driver of this type of offend analysis that previously have never be do despite year of concern be raise ask she to advise we on what further review investigation and action would be need to address the current and historical failure that she find tell parliament in january that expect baroness casey to deliver the same kind of impactful and no holds bar report that she produce on rotherham in so that we never shy away from the reality of these terrible crime be grateful that louise and her team have do exactly that conduct hugely wide range assessment in just four month the finding of her audit be damn at its heart she identify deep root failure to treat child as child and continue failure to protect child and teenage girl from rape exploitation and serious violence and from the scar that last lifetime she find too much fragmentation in the authority response too little sharing of information too much reliance on flawed datum too much denial too little justice too many criminal get off and too many victim be let down the audit describe victim as young as often those in care or child with learning or physical disability be single out for groom precisely because of their vulnerability perpetrator still walk free because no one join the dot or because the law end up protect they instead of the victim they have exploit and deep root institutional failure stretch back decade where organisation that should have protect child and punish offender look the other way baroness casey find that blindness ignorance prejudice defensiveness and even good but misdirect intention all play part in that collective failure on the key issue of ethnicity that ask baroness casey to examine she have find continue failure to gather proper robust national datum despite concern be raise go back many year in the local datum examine from three police force the audit identify clear evidence of over representation among suspect of asian and pakistani heritage man baroness casey refer to example of organisation avoid the topic altogether for fear of appear racist or raise community tension these finding be deeply disturbing but most disturbing of all as baroness casey make clear be the fact that too many of they be not new as her audit set out there have be year of report review inquiry and investigation into the appalling rape exploitation and violent crime against child detail over page of her report but too little have change we have lose more than decade that must end now baroness casey set out recommendation for change and we will take action on all of they immediately because we can not afford more waste year we will introduce new law to protect child and support victim so that they stop be blame for the appalling crime commit against they new major police operation to pursue perpetrator and put they behind bar new national inquiry to direct local investigation and hold institution to account for past failure new ethnicity datum and research so that we face up to the fact on exploitation and abuse new action across child social service and other agency to identify child at risk and further action to support child victim and tackle new form of exploitation and abuse online take together this will mark the big programme of work ever pursue to root out the scourge of grooming gang and child sexual exploitation those vile perpetrator who have grow use to the authority look the other way must have no place to hide so let spell out the next step that we be announce today baroness casey first recommendation be that we must see child as child she conclude that too many grooming case have be drop or downgrade from rape to less charge because to year old be perceive to have be in love with or consent to sex with the perpetrator so we will change the law to ensure that adult who engage in penetrative sex with child under face the most serious charge of rape and we will work closely with the crown prosecution service and the police to ensure that there be safeguard for consensual teenage relationship we will change the law so that those convict for child prostitution offence while their rapist get off scot free will have their conviction disregard and their criminal record expunge baroness casey next recommendation be national criminal investigation as have set out arrest and investigation be rise but the audit recommend that we go far so can announce that the police will launch new national criminal operation into groom gang oversee by the national crime agency it will bring together for the first time all arm of the police response and develop rigorous new national operating model that all force across the country will be able to adopt ensure that groom gang be always treat as serious and organised crime and so that rapist who groom child whether their crime be commit decade ago or be still be commit today can end up behind bar alongside justice there must also be accountability and action we have begin implement the recommendation from past inquiry include professor jay independent inquiry and we have say that further inquiry be need to get accountability in local area tell the house in january that would undertake further work on how to ensure that those inquiry could get the evidence that they need to properly hold institution to account we have seek response from local council too we ask baroness casey to review those response as well as the arrangement and power use in past investigation and inquiry and to consider the good mean of get to the truth her report conclude that further local investigation be need but they should be direct and oversee by national commission with statutory inquiry power we agree and we will set up national inquiry to that effect baroness casey be not recommend another overarch inquiry of the kind conduct by professor alexis jay she recommend that the inquiry be time limited and its purpose must be to challenge what the audit describe as continue denial resistance and legal wrangling among local agency we will set out further detail on the national inquiry in due course warn in january that the data collection we inherit from the previous government on ethnicity be completely inadequate the datum be collect on only of suspect baroness casey audit confirm that ethnicity datum be not record for two third of groom gang perpetrator and that the data be not good enough to support any statement about the ethnicity of group base child sexual exploitation offender at the national level agree with that conclusion frankly it be ridiculous and help no one that this basic information be not collect especially as there have be warning and recommendation stretch back year about the woefully inadequate datum on perpetrator which prevent pattern of crime from be understand and tackle the immediate change to police recording practice that announce in january be start to improve the datum but we need to go much far baroness casey audit examine local datum in three police force area greater manchester west yorkshire and south yorkshire where high profile case involve pakistani heritage man have long be investigate and report she find there that the suspect of group base child sexual offence be disproportionately likely to be asian man she also find indication of disproportionality in serious case review although much more robust national datum be need we can not and must not shy away from those finding as baroness casey say ignore the issue not examine and expose they to the light allow the criminality and depravity of minority of man to be use to marginalise whole community the vast majority of people in our british asian and pakistani heritage community continue to be appal by these terrible crime and agree that the criminal minority of sick predator and perpetrator in every community must be deal with robustly by criminal law baroness casey review also identify prosecution and investigation into perpetrator who be white british european african or middle eastern just as alexis jay inquiry conclude that all ethnicity and community be involve in appal child abuse crime so that there be accurate information to help tackle serious crime we will for the first time make it formal requirement to collect ethnicity and nationality datum in all case of child sexual abuse and exploitation we will also commission new research on the cultural and social driver of child sexual exploitation misogyny and violence against woman and girl as baroness casey have recommend the audit final group of recommendation be about the continue failure of agency that should be keep child safe to share vital information or act on clear sign of risk worryingly the audit find that although the number of report to the police of child sexual abuse and exploitation have go up the number of child sexual abuse case identify for protection plan by local child service have fall to its low ever but no one have be curious about why that be the audit also detail an abysmal failure to respond to year of recommendation and warning about the failing of inter agency co operation we will act at pace to deliver baroness casey recommendation for mandatory information sharing between agency and for unique reference number for child build on work already be take forward by my right hon friend the education secretary my right hon friend the transport secretary will also work at pace to close loophole in taxi licensing law want to respond to three other important issue identify by baroness casey in her report but on which she have not make specific recommendation on support for victim my right hon friend the health secretary will fund additional training for mental health staff in school on identify and support child and young people who have experience trauma exploitation and abuse baroness casey report that she come across case involve suspect who be asylum seeker we have ask her team to provide all the evidence they find to the home office so that immigration enforcement can immediately pursue individual case with the police let make it clear that those who groom child or commit sexual offence will not be grant asylum in the uk and we will do everything in our power to remove they do not believe that the law we have inherit be strong enough so we be bring forward change to the law so that anyone convict of sexual offence be exclude from the asylum system and deny refugee status we have already increase the removal of foreign national offender by since the election and we be draw up new arrangement to identify and remove those who have commit much wide range of offence finally baroness casey describe way in which pattern of groom gang child sexual exploitation be change and evidence that rape and sexual exploitation be take place in street gang and drug gang who combine criminal and sexual exploitation do not believe that this kind of exploitation have be investigate sufficiently the report also describe sexual exploitation in modern slavery and trafficking case most significantly of all it describe the huge increase in online grooming and horrendous online sexual exploitation and abuse include through the use of social medium app to build up relationship and lure child into physical abuse the audit quote police expert who say if rotherham be to happen again today it would start online we be pass world lead law to target those who groom and exploit child online and invest in cut edge technology to target the high harm offender but we need to do much more or the new scandal and shameful crime of the future will be miss when the final report of alexis jay seven year national inquiry be publish in october the then home secretary grant shapps issue profound and formal public apology to the victim of child sexual abuse who be so badly let down over decade by different level of the state as shadow home secretary at the time join he in that apology on behalf of the opposition and extend it to victim of child sexual exploitation too to the victim and survivor of sexual exploitation and grooming gang on behalf of this and past government and the many public authority that let you down want to reiterate an unequivocal apology for the unimaginable pain and suffering that you have suffer and for the failure of our country institution over decade to prevent that harm and keep you safe but word be not enough victim and survivor need action the reform that have set out today will be the strong action that any government have take to tackle child sexual exploitation there will be more police investigation more arrest new inquiry change to the law to protect child and fundamental overhaul of the way organisation work in order to support victim and put perpetrator behind bar but none of that will work unless everyone be part of it and everyone work together to keep our child safe commend this statement to the house hopefully the report will be available in the table office for those member who wish to see it the home secretary quite rightly take long than expect and have no problem with that say to the leader of the opposition and to the lib dems that it be available to they to do the same thank the home secretary for advance sight of the statement although when listen to it could not believe my ear it be as if this be the government plan all along when we all know it be another turn after month of pressure the prime minister have finally accept our call for full statutory national inquiry into groom gang and welcome our finally reach this point we must remember that this be not victory for politician especially not for the one like the home secretary and the prime minister who have to be drag to this position this be victory for the survivor who have be call for this for year however have be speak to many who do not have confidence that government who ignore their concern will deliver before turn to the detail of the home secretary statement want to recognise the tireless work of those who refuse to let this issue be bury survivor like fiona goddard who bravely waive her anonymity the parent of survivor like marlon west who speak to this morning maggie oliver whose courage in speak truth to power have be instrumental in bring we to this point the late andrew norfolk whose fearless journalism bring these crime to light baroness casey for her review and charlie peters who have consistently be voice for the voiceless the prime minister handling of this scandal be an extraordinary failure of leadership his judgment have once again be find want since he become prime minister he and the home secretary dismiss call for an inquiry because they do not want to cause stir they accuse those of we who demand justice for the victim of this scandal of jump on far right bandwagon claim that the prime minister official spokesman restate this weekend shameful time and again it have be leave to the conservatives to force this issue three they can all mutter now but these labour mp vote against national inquiry three time the liberal democrats do not bother to vote at all asleep at the wheel labour mp vote against reason amendment to the children wellbeing and schools bill and in committee they vote against the bill at committee stage of the crime and policing order mr swallow want you to set good example this be very serious statement and temper be run high but certainly do not want to see you point shout and bawl in that way mr speaker they can point and shout as much as they like they know the truth just as we on the conservative benches do three will repeat myself labour mp vote against the reason amendment to the child bill in committee they vote against that bill and they vote against the crime and policing bill in committee they vote against national inquiry and at prime minister question the prime minister repeatedly rule out national inquiry to the cheer of all the labour mp who be now pretend that they believe in an inquiry all along no doubt in her response to the home secretary will try to claim that the previous government do nothing wholly false assertion that she should not repeat today the conservative government take extensive action start with the original jay report commission in by the then home secretary theresa may year later she commission the independent investigation into child sexual abuse and sajid javid commission ethnicity datum collection in it be wrong to claim as the home secretary do that ethnicity data collection have not be do remind she that the foreign secretary criticise sajid javid at the time say that he be bring the office of home secretary into disrepute and that he be pander to the far right for do exactly what the home secretary say she will now do they should be ashamed of themselves we accept all the recommendation make by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in except the recommendation to have new cabinet minister which would not have make any difference at all to the victim of this scandal the home secretary claim that the recommendation sit on the shelf but let be clear that we go far than those recommendation it be the conservatives who establish the grooming gang taskforce which support police force to make arrest for group base child sexual exploitation last year so do not tell that we do nothing it be vital that this inquiry be robust swift and above all independent there be legitimate concern about institution investigate themselves especially as some of the most egregious case of institutional failure occur in labour control authority interruption labour members can moan as much as they like but the people out there believe that be why nothing have happen yet in greater manchester operation augusta be prematurely shut down in rotherham which have be under continuous labour control since we see repeat failure in telford where labour have predominantly hold power the current mp the hon member for telford shaun davies initially reject call for an inquiry while serve as council leader this inquiry must have tooth it must start with known hotspot such as bradford and rochdale and commend my hon friend the member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore for his persistent advocacy on this issue we need clear commitment for example will the inquiry examine the role of ethnicity in these crime confront hard truth about potential cover up motivate by fear of appear racist interruption there be no point in labour members mutter the home secretary say it herself speak to the father of survivor just this morning and he tell that survivor need to have someone who be independent and who they can go to and trust it be no use they be force to speak to the same authority who ignore they in the first place will this inquiry ensure that no one whether police officer councillor or council official be beyond scrutiny the government approach to the casey review itself raise serious concern while the review finding be crucial we as legislator be send here to make decision not to outsource the difficult one the prime minister have wait month for someone to take this decision for he that be the kind of dither and delay that the survivor complain about we need answer to the follow question the house deserve to know what change the prime minister mind from think that this be dog whistle far right politic to something that he must do when exactly do baroness casey submit her finding to downing street and do the government request any change to her report do the home secretary agree that anyone in authority who deliberately cover up these disgusting crime should be prosecute for misconduct in public office and that those prosecution should happen alongside not after the inquiry we believe that anyone in the police local authority social service or even the cps who cover this up because they care more about so call community relation than about protect vulnerable girl as young as year old should be pursue we welcome the home secretary comment about perpetrator not be able to make asylum claim remind she that we put forward an amendment to the border security asylum and immigration bill and she and all her colleague vote against that very measure do she now agree that the perpetrator should also not be able to make human right claim to avoid deportation and will she legislate to do that will the inquiry be conclude within two year and will every one of the town affect be cover include bradford which be still refuse to conduct an inquiry into this will those local inquiry have the power to summon witness or be that power only for the national inquiry most critically we need clear timeline for conclusion and action the victim can not wait another decade for justice we should be able to do this in two year finally we do not need to commission report to tell we what we already know will the home secretary apologise on behalf of herself the labour party and the prime minister for waste so much time and vote against this dismiss the concern of the survivor the house the british public and most importantly the many brave survivor deserve clear answer from government of dither and delay do not think the leader of the opposition can have read the report and see the seriousness of its conclusion because it set out timeline of failure from to repeat report and recommendation be not act on on child protection on police investigation on ethnicity datum on datum sharing and on support for victim for of those year her party be in government include year in which she be the minister for child and family then the minister for equality cover race and ethnicity issue and violence against woman and girl do not hear she raise any of these issue until january this year she will know that the prime minister do not just raise they but act on they he bring the first prosecution against groom gang and call for action to address ethnicity issue in she will also know that the safeguarding minister my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips and have raise these issue repeatedly the leader of the opposition refer to professor alexis jay independent inquiry into child sexual abuse call for that inquiry and strongly support it and we want it to work on cross party basis we support its conclusion but the leader of the opposition party do absolutely nothing to implement they time and again recommendation just sit on the shelf and it have take this government to bring forward the mandatory duty to report she say that we should ensure that people who have engage in cover up be prosecute agree which be why the labour party be change the law to make that possible so that cover up can not happen and people be hold to account the leader of the opposition also know that in the vote she refer to what she want to do the amendment she table would have wreck the children wellbeing and schools bill that bill include two of baroness casey recommendation to strengthen child protection recommendation that the leader of the opposition and her party refuse to introduce over year be sorry that she choose not to join in the apology to victim and survivor for decade of failure in that apology be cross party one which if she really have victim interest and the national interest at heart it should be again listen with cold fury to what be come out of the mouth of the leader of the opposition because much of it be beneath contempt commend the home secretary for her statement and for commission fiercely independent figure such as louise casey to conduct this national audit without which we would not have have today outcome in rochdale we know all too well how many year it have take for victim to get the justice they deserve they have wait many many year to see these sick criminal lock up and put behind bar only last week we have seven more of these pervert lock up in rochdale which be testament to the police and the prosecution who finally get those case together however the victim also want accountability for anyone in position of authority as the home secretary have say anyone who find out about this or know about it and fail to act do she agree that no councillor from any political party no social worker no police officer no council officer and no ethnic group should hide from the fierce scrutiny of this national inquiry my hon friend be right to raise the appalling case in his constituency where seven people be convict on friday he will also know that further criminal investigation be still ongoing it be shameful how long it have take to get justice for those victim agree with he that no one can hide from justice on this appalling issue on which victim and survivor have be let down for far too long hope that support that aim will be cross party process call the liberal democrat spokesperson child sexual abuse and exploitation be among the most abhorrent crime imaginable and we must all support every effort to deliver justice for victim and prevent these vile act from happen again it be of course right that the government follow the recommendation of baroness casey report include new national inquiry survivor must be at the heart of this process their voice experience and insight must shape both the inquiry and its outcome and would welcome hear more from the home secretary about how she intend to ensure survivor be hear be respect and essentially be allow to build on their exist testimony without be ask to repeat themselves and relive their abuse again and again the seven year inquiry into child sexual abuse chair by professor alexis jay deliver its final report in and the government at the time deliver none of its recommendation leave survivor wait for justice in her remark the home secretary mention two of professor jay recommendation be introduce through the crime and policing bill mandatory reporting duty and aggravate offence for groom offender what do this new inquiry mean for the remain recommendation of professor jay will victim and survivor see all recommendation implement while the new inquiry be be carry out any new inquiry must be more than symbolic it must be robust victim centre and capable of drive real change duty of candour would require public official and authority to co operate fully with such an inquiry so it continue to be disappointing that the government have delay bring that provision forward ask the home secretary plainly what be stop the government from introduce duty of candour via hillsborough law now finally now that baroness casey have complete her review welcome her appointment as chair of the independent commission into adult social care trust that she will bring to that hugely important role the same determination to challenge injustice and to champion the voice of those too often leave unheard the hon member make important point about the seriousness of this crime and she be right too that we need to continue to implement the recommendation of the overarch inquiry into child abuse the safeguarding minister update the house before easter on those recommendation and the action we be take forward on they can tell the hon lady that in the home office measure be already well under way and we will continue to do that it be important that we do not simply have recommendation sit on shelf thing have to be implement on the hillsborough law we be work at pace to get the detail right and to bring it before the house the hon lady will understand that it need to meet the expectation of the hillsborough family as well as be right for the house we will continue to work on the wide issue too in her foreword baroness casey say if we get this right year ago see these girl as child rap rather than wayward teenager or collaborator in their abuse collect ethnicity datum and acknowledge as system that we do not do good enough job then doubt we be in this place now we lose decade we can not lose another one first may thank the home secretary for her statement and for her leadership and commitment to get grip on this issue as member of parliament for one of the large constituency of muslim and pakistani heritage people know the sheer anger and condemnation that the vast majority of they share like all briton who be against those who commit these vile action and vile sexual abuse that be back up not only by recent polling by opinium show that majority of muslims be deeply concerned about groom gang but by sermon in mosque letter from lead figure demonstration on the street and so much more that be often not give the medium coverage it deserve be pleased to see that the national crime agency will be involve in the future inquiry let reiterate in this house that british muslims stand on the side of victim and support the full force of the law be use against all perpetrator of abuse do the home secretary agree that those who display selective outrage or fan the flame to blame entire community do nothing to protect innocent victim or far the cause of victim may welcome my hon friend point that she make about the anger in her community and the anger across british muslim community towards the grooming gang towards the rape of child and towards these appalling crime she have long call for work include strong action from the police to be able to go after perpetrator and bring they to justice she be right that the horror at crime commit against child and in particular against young girl be share across community it be in the interest of those child and victim survivor that we have reform now call the chair of the select committee thank the home secretary for her statement and for early sight of it and be pleased that baroness casey have agree to appear before the committee tomorrow to set out the content of her report more clearly however be concerned about the potential for inquiry intend to get to the truth to prejudice criminal trial how do the home secretary envisage the two element run alongside each other an inquiry and criminal prosecution welcome that question and be glad that baroness casey will have the opportunity to set out more detail of her finding as the right hon lady will know baroness casey have huge expertise and determination and will be forthright in give the evidence that she have draw together it will be important for the commission conduct the independent inquiry to have arrangement with police force to ensure that criminal investigation that be currently under way be not cut across it be also important to ensure that we can uncover institutional failing because institutional failure to pursue action or the turning of blind eye need to be look into in particular area as part of the local investigation and the national inquiry as the right hon lady will know arrangement of this kind have feature in past inquiry so they can be make and will need to be make again now let first praise and pay tribute to survivor across the country and draw attention again to the survivor who work in telford along with and various organisation to carry out the local review we do so because the then home secretary amber rudd and the then local government minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak refuse to provide statutory inquiry into what have happen in telford that be why we work with the police and crime commissioner who happen to be conservative and with people across the political spectrum to take this matter out of the party political field and try to find answer in our small part of the world what we need though be action we need action in respect of the jay inquiry and in respect of the casey review but do the home secretary agree that we also need action in respect of the number of local review that have take place up and down the country whose finding have not be on the desk of ministers over the last year and which have therefore not receive the attention that they deserve my hon friend be right what we need be change and action and recommendation from inquiry need to be implement part of the strength of the telford inquiry lie in the fact that victim and survivor be at its very heart and there be also serious plan to ensure and way of ensure that the recommendation be implement that be crucial it be no good have inquiry if recommendation just sit on the shelf we must ensure that they be implement as well as pursue answer the fact that victim and survivor of this horrific crime literally have to become campaigner themselves to reach this outcome should make everyone in the house stop and think when last meet the safeguarding minister the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips along with the lead child abuse lawyer david greenwood we point out the fundamental flaw in her government groom gang strategy namely the completely ridiculous decision to give council leader in area such as keighley and bradford the option to simply say no to an inquiry now that we have an inquiry equip with statutory power may ask the home secretary what message she have for local leader in my region who think that they can still get away with say no and what message she have for victim such as fiona goddard who be also from my area and who will no doubt be worry like that there will still be no focus on keighley and the wide bradford district know that the hon member have meet the safeguarding minister she have speak again to fiona goddard this morning to ensure that the voice of victim survivor and campaigner be at the heart of the inquiry he will know that the safeguarding minister say to he in their meeting that she would not allow local council to be able to turn their back and say no to investigation where they be need that be why we have accept baroness casey recommendation to have national inquiry that will underpin those local investigation obviously the final decision will be matter for the independent chair of the commission but we will ensure that the hon member concern and those of victim be pass on the national inquiry thank my right hon friend for her statement also pass on my thank to dame louise casey for meet oldham victim and survivor of cse they want no further delay to justice and for perpetrator to face the full force of the law now it be unacceptable that some be be give court date for with all the risk that that imply they want no more red tape and they want survivor to be at the heart of root out perpetrator and get justice can the home secretary ensure that this will happen and will she now consider make misogyny hate crime welcome what my hon friend have do over many year to champion victim in oldham and across her constituency and to work with survivor she be right to point to the terrible delay in the justice system she will know that the lord chancellor be take forward reform to look at how the huge backlog particularly in crown court case can be deal with justice delay be justice deny and so many survivor have already wait far too long for justice assure my hon friend that those concern be uppermost in the lord chancellor mind regardless of whether local inquiry be commission by council will there be an opportunity for those same area to fall under the remit of the national inquiry to ensure that some of the ongoing issue to which the home secretary herself have refer be catch within the new framework of the inquiry the right hon gentleman raise an important question ultimately the final decision will need to be for the independent chair and the commission that be what happen when we set it up as national inquiry rather than government process he will know that concern have be raise about investigation and inquiry that have take place in greater manchester where some area could not be compel to take part as result there have be work with his majesty inspectorate of constabulary to pursue the final stage of an investigation and inquiry we do look at whether there be other power either through local government act or through police inspection power however the simple way to address this issue be for it to be do through the national inquiry the right hon gentleman will be able to make representation about his area and other mps will be able to make representation about their area too welcome the statement and the absolute determination of baroness casey and this government to hold to account perpetrator and those who may have be involve in cover up one of the report recommendation be about the confusion between different agency and particular element of that be about taxi licensing and taxi from out of town area know from my city of peterborough the challenge to law abide decent taxi driver who be undercut by different licensing law but also to law enforcement and the safety of passenger when we have number plate from different area note that that be the focus of one of the recommendation can my right hon friend give we more detail on how we will move at speed to create level playing field nationally so that passenger be safe and driver have the support they need to keep everyone safe welcome my hon friend point as he will know many local authority across the country have work to ensure that they raise standard and check in their licensing arrangement particularly those in area where there have be serious problem and criminal case however those check and safeguard can end up be undermine by the licensing of taxi in other area that do not have such check so we be look to take forward reform to the law the transport secretary be look at exactly this issue to make sure that we find way to close the loophole as survivor of child sexual abuse myself stand in solidarity with the many victim and survivor the system have fail over many many year can say that the horror the trauma and the guilt never leave you and so hope that every survivor who be identify receive the mental health and other support that they deserve to help rebuild their life survivor have witness very many promise the recommendation and the call of never again time and again what will the home secretary do and how will she reassure they that this will not be another one of those example can just say that be really let down and disgust that the leader of the opposition begin her remark with party political assault on her opponent victim and survivor deserve more than smug tell you so diatribe victim and survivor deserve action thank the hon member for speak out about his experience do not underestimate how brave it be and how difficult it can be to do that and he will be give all kind of support to other victim and survivor simply by the fact that he have do so the hon member be right to raise the challenge of how we ensure that recommendation be actually implement he will know that we want to extend therapeutic support to victim and survivor but as the health secretary be set out we will start by provide additional support and training for those who provide mental health support in our school at manchester minshull street crown court last week seven man be convict for sicken crime as part of grooming gang one of their victim girl who be abuse by in excess of man be advise by the police to make claim for criminal injury compensation for which she would have receive just she do not make claim but that do not stop the defence from argue that she make up accusation to bolster claim for compensation the government will be aware that have raise on many occasion the inadequacy of the criminal injury compensation framework for victim of sexual violence and exploitation and they will be aware of recommendation from the iicsa review and the victims commissioner on this matter while no amount of money could be adequate to compensate victim such as girl we owe it to they to ensure that they have the financial support require to rebuild their life and do not have to choose between that and justice how much long will we all be wait for this thank my hon friend for raise this matter the safeguarding minister take this issue very seriously and we can not have issue relate to the criminal injury compensation scheme be raise in court in way that undermine victim and survivor who have bravely show that they be able to speak out about abuse that have haunt their life for so long we will look at this issue far welcome the statement from the home secretary and the fact that there will now be national inquiry do the home secretary think that it will be finish within let we say two year for the british people give that she quite rightly apologise to the victim and survivor will she apologise on behalf of the prime minister who smear and label those of we who call for national inquiry the hon member raise the timescale in the discussion we have have with baroness casey and recognise the many issue that people want to raise in the inquiry we have expect that it would take around three year but if the commission be able to work fast than that people will clearly want answer as swiftly as possible the final detail about the timing be obviously to be determine we need to make sure both that we be implement the recommendation of previous inquiry and that we be pursue far the investigation in local area as swiftly as possible reiterate in my statement recognition of the huge harm that have be do to victim and survivor through the decade would urge the hon member to look at the page section of louise casey report on the failure year after year to follow through and take action and do believe that victim and survivor be owe an apology for that failure over very many year think it be fair to say that although there be many issue in this house we disagree on an issue of this magnitude be something that should bring all of we as parliamentarian together to work to ensure that we get justice for the victim the home secretary outline the next phase but if we be really honest with ourselves for every victim who have come forward to share her horrific testimony there be so many more girl up and down the country who have not come forward it be in their interest that we make sure we get this right the home secretary outline the issue around datum and the lack of datum gathering one area have raise consistently be criminal exploitation by gang who sexually exploit young people and then use they to carry out their horrific county line up and down the country do the home secretary agree that the collection of datum must also lay with the metropolitan police other police force across the country and the british transport police my hon friend be right that so many victim and survivor do not come forward we need to make it easy for people to do so and recognise the scale of abuse agree with she on the really important issue about county line and the interaction between criminal exploitation and sexual exploitation too often the county line and criminal exploitation be see as an issue involve teenage boy but very often teenage girl be also draw in and very often that also mean sexual exploitation do not believe that enough investigation have yet be do into that particular pattern and form of child sexual abuse and exploitation as we strengthen the law on the criminal exploitation of child we need to ensure that this issue be properly pursue as she say as part of the data gathering and through further research this government have be drag kick and scream to deliver national inquiry have dismiss the plea of the nation as jump on far right bandwagon that reluctance be why my hon friend the member for great yarmouth rupert lowe will continue his inquiry and why will be support he it will the government inquiry investigate the political motivation behind the cover up include the role of the labour party or will that continue to be sweep under the carpet everyone should want not just to get to the truth about past failure but to ensure we make the change to protect child for the future that include change in social service change in police and the police operation which hope the right hon lady would welcome to take action to put perpetrator behind bar and action to gather proper ethnicity datum which simply have not be gather properly before louise casey report be very clear the data gathering that the right hon lady government leave behind be totally inadequate hope she will agree to all those factor be extremely important so that we can get strong protection and truth for victim welcome the government announcement that there will be national inquiry every penny spend on stamp out the evil of child abuser be money well spend although welcome notice of this inquiry will undoubtedly cause great deal of trauma and distress for both historic and present day victim as violation commit against they be revisit as the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde reference what step can the government take to ensure that victim and witness have access to robust mental health support how can we ensure that our court as mention by my hon friend the member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams especially in place like greater manchester that face extensive court backlog be sufficiently resource to ensure that at the end of the process justice be finally deliver know that my hon friend have champion victim and survivor in her area and community she be right to say that we have to make sure that victim and survivor get support some victim and survivor give evidence to the original professor alexis jay inquiry it be so important that they do not do so in vain and that we make the reform and the change relate to that recommendation my hon friend be also right to say we need to increase the therapeutic support for victim and survivor that will start with provide additional support for child one of the reason be not supportive six month ago in january of the government strategy be that it could not compel local inquiry to bring forward witness which be key listen to our question carefully could the home secretary clarify whether those local inquiry will be able to compel witness whether that be also the case on the national side and whether those power will be use to ensure that no stone be leave unturned the answer be yes recognise that the hon gentleman have raise this issue back in january say that would undertake further work to ensure that the local investigation have the power to compel witness in order to be able to get the evidence we agree with baroness casey and have conclude that the right way to do this be to have the national inquiry which will mean that every local investigation have full power to compel witness and evidence where and how those investigation take place will be direct by the national commission and the national inquiry in order to ensure they have those full power in place the crime we be discuss today be not just an historic crime it be happen right now out in community and we be fail to protect the current victim of this awful child abuse welcome the new inquiry but my concern be about delay we have have plenty of inquiry taskforce and review whose conclusion have not be implement my concern be that this new inquiry will monopolise our attention when we should also be focus on protect victim right now will the home secretary commit to this inquiry not detract or divert resource from the recommendation that we know need to be implement and to roll out nationally the devolved child trafficking pilot which we know have be work for four year in order to protect child victim can tell my hon friend that we be go to expand that and that we will not let up the pace of implement measure and recommendation that include the work that the education secretary be already do on the mandatory sharing of datum on child at risk the new identifier and the measure in the crime and policing bill on mandatory reporting crucially we have also already increase the resource for police operation to be able to review closed case that be why we already have case identify for review although we expect that figure shortly to rise to over case those be case that be close with no further action be take that be now be look at again not wait for the inquiry but take action now to protect child the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts and be the sole remain member of the house who serve on the communities and local government committee when we conduct the inquiry into rotherham in both november and march we hear from the victim then about the terrible abuse they have suffer and interview dame louise casey at great length about her concern over what be happen and what be be allow to happen there be clearly still something go on which be that most victim be young girl from broken home who have be take into care by local authority and have never experience the love of family they then take the view that someone express some form of love be something that they should like and enjoy when the reality be that they be be ruthlessly exploit by individual who should know well and be evil the key concern here be the lackadaisical approach that have be take by many local authority social worker police force and other body my genuine concern which be sure be share by other member be that local inquiry will not get individual who either turn blind eye or actually participate in the abuse to give evidence will the home secretary ensure that witness be call to those inquiry under oath so that we can get to the bottom of this and make sure that those who turn blind eye to or connive in this abuse be bring to justice as well as the perpetrator reassure the hon member that the point of have the national inquiry be to ensure that where local institution be be examine the commission have power to compel witness take evidence under oath and gather information paper and evidence as it see fit to make sure that we can get to the heart of this institutional failure the hon member be also right to say that this be about vile criminal know when young child teenage girl especially be vulnerable to the most appalling exploitation and coercion they play with child emotion and vulnerability to draw they into what be ultimately violent crime and the most terrible abuse this raise question particularly when the number of child protection case around sexual abuse identify by social service have drop we be very concerned about that and the education secretary be now investigate there be also failure to properly share datum about the child who be at risk the one who be go miss the hon member mention the evidence from the work he and the communities and local government committee do year ago about miss child and child in care it be all the same evidence now and we have get to be well at pursue the evidence strongly welcome the home secretary announcement of an inquiry and its commitment to survivor it be absolutely right that the inquiry focus on local area where we know that survivor have be fail by the authority that be suppose to protect they but it be also essential that we draw lesson for the whole uk early this year professor alexis jay from the university of strathclyde warn the home affairs committee that scotland be not immune to the kind of organise abuse that we have witness elsewhere in the uk scotland victim and survivor deserve the same assurance on accountability and robust safeguarding measure as anywhere else in the uk so will the home secretary actively seek engagement with the scottish government and offer they support and advice to ensure that they wholeheartedly implement the jay recommendation effectively welcome my hon friend point the minister for safeguarding will follow up these issue with the devolved administration my hon friend be right that this be devolved issue but that this kind of appal crime be happen everywhere action be need everywhere to safeguard and protect child order appreciate how sensitive the topic be but long question mean that few colleague will get in shorter answer from the secretary of state will help as well at one of my surgery hear from civil servant who have gather evidence for the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse across the whole of england they describe themselves as be leave emotionally and physically drain after collect evidence only for the government not to act on it welcome this government acceptance of the casey review finding but will the secretary of state assure my constituent and other civil servant that there will be no delay in implement the finding of the iicsa can assure the hon member that we be take forward the recommendation already the minister for safeguarding update the house on all the iicsa recommendation before easter some require legislation include legislation that be pass through the house at the moment we will have further discussion on those issue later this week we be already able to take forward some of the issue and we will continue to update the house on the progress of the recommendation welcome this evidence lead action on groom gang it take courage to come forward and share deeply traumatic experience so will the home secretary confirm that this inquiry will build on the evidence already collect and recommendation make over previous inquiry investigation and report include the last national inquiry which in produce page report specifically on groom gang and look at over recommendation that have already be make crucially will she ensure that there be no delay to the action that this government be already take to bring perpetrator to justice stamp out these vile crime and protect our vulnerable child agree with my hon friend we have agree to implement all the recommendation from the two year inquiry into child sexual exploitation conduct as part of the professor alexis jay review we be take forward one of those on aggravate sentencing for groom offence as part of the crime and policing bill we be also introduce similar parallel arrangement for online abuse because we must ensure that we be also take action on online grooming which have escalate and accelerate since professor jay work my hillingdon constituent have see the work that the local authority have have to do over many decade to deal with child sexual exploitation and trafficking arise from heathrow when lead the local government association response when these case first come to light one issue that arise be the sharing of information will the home secretary assure the house that follow this inquiry she will upgrade the status of the work together to safeguard children guidance and in particular ensure that those body accountable to the home office such as the police understand it and take it as seriously as other body do so that we do not see people fall through the crack between agency welcome the hon member point baroness casey review identify that sexual exploitation be central part of trafficking and modern slavery as well agree with he about the importance of share information time and again on these basic thing everybody say the right word and then it do not happen in practice we need the law to change but we also need system to change to make it easy to share that information we will take that forward both in policing and as part of the work that my right hon friend the education secretary be do so that it be much easy to share that information do my right hon friend agree that there have be no vote on whether to have national inquiry into groom gang the vote be about the safeguard of the children wellbeing and schools bill and that follow the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and the page that deal specifically with grooming gang the government be right to have the local inquiry and the rapid national audit now that baroness casey have recommend national inquiry into groom gang the conservative party should be work with we for the sake of the victim rather than attempt to score political point as the leader of the opposition do baroness casey audit be conduct in just four month but look at some of the issue in considerable detail it also set out the fact that we have have year of different report and inquiry that include some of the issue around the page report that my hon friend refer to and other report as well the crucial thing be that we need action victim and survivor need answer and we need to pursue serious failing wherever they be find but we must also ensure that when recommendation be make they be implement plaid cymru welcome the government statement and hope that it will lead to concrete properly fund action in february plaid cymru amendment call on the welsh government to work with police force on an all wales audit of child abuse case and it be back unanimously what concrete step have be take between the welsh and uk government since the passing of that vote to bring justice to victim the hon member will know that many of the issue around social service provision be matter for the welsh government but issue around police be cover by the home office we have already be work with police force across the country to strengthen the work of the child sexual exploitation taskforce to be able to look at different case that have be close as well as to strengthen their work with local partner to be able to pursue these terrible crime as part of the police operation that will be lead by the national crime agency and draw on expertise from across the country we will ensure that that connect with the work be do by the welsh government the safeguarding minister be follow up with devolved administration far to the quite pertinent comment from the hon member for harrow east bob blackman this country break social care system for child be potentially create future victim today and while review at local level will look at what happen in the past we need to do our good to make sure that these crime by appal people do not continue what more will the home secretary be do with the department for education to ensure that young people who be be groom online and groom in public can spot the sign so that they know when and how to ask for help otherwise unfortunately we could see this cycle continue for decade to come agree with my hon friend that we need action across social service and that be why the children wellbeing and schools bill that the education secretary be take forward be so important the issue around online grooming and exploitation be immensely important this be both about the abuse that stay online often force child to get involve in the most appalling abuse and act through online blackmail pressure and coercion and about the way in which this be use to provoke offline activity lead to offline physical abuse and contact abuse we be work with the national crime agency on new technology to address this and with the education department on how we build child resilience in deal with these crime much have be make in the house this afternoon of the fact that the former director of public prosecutions now the prime minister instigate prosecution against groom gang that be so he be clearly well place than most of we to understand the need for the national inquiry that he initially so rigidly resist but would like to associate myself with the apology offer by the right hon lady to the house on behalf of all of we and all the authority that have fail young people so dismally those young people now want to know that they can have confidence and trust in the national inquiry and in who lead it can she tell the house who that be likely to be and what term of reference they will have the term of reference will be set out in due course we have not yet appoint or determine the chair for the national inquiry we will do so and set that out for the house welcome the hon gentleman response on the issue of the national apology for the historical and current challenge that have lead to victim be let down over very many year think his response echo the way in which the whole house come together in around similar support for victim welcome the casey report and the new action outline by the secretary of state today specifically welcome the requirement for the collection of ethnicity and nationality datum the report refer to different and change model and pattern of abuse the secretary of state will be aware that there have be historical allegation involve the grooming and sexual abuse of sikh girl will she ensure that the requirement to collect ethnicity and nationality datum extend to victim so that we can see the evidence for any such model once and for all my hon friend raise an important issue about victim victim in the many community that he have talk about include sikh girl often lack the confidence to come forward and feel the sense of shame that prevent young people from be able to ask for help when they need it it be therefore essential that we strengthen the ethnicity datum around victim as well as around perpetrator to make sure that victim and survivor in all community get the support and safeguard they need the official document publish online by the government say that the national inquiry will only co ordinate series of targeted local investigation how many local investigation will the inquiry co ordinate will it cover the whole of england and wales yes or no the decision about which area be look into and how many will be matter for the commission we envisage the commission last for three year know that the leader of the opposition suggest two year but we think it will need around three year to be able to pursue the scale of work that be need think it be right that the final decision be one for the commission and the independent national inquiry itself and it will be able to look anywhere across england and wales and to pursue the evidence wherever it see fit thank the home secretary for the robust measure she have lay out can she reaffirm the commitment that the government make in january that the iicsa recommendation relevant to the home office will be implement in full yes can that work be either complete or well under way in an era when information be increasingly contest and weaponise political party would do well to lead by example by provide credible information and avoid the spread of disinformation include about the event proceeding and procedure of this house give that baroness casey report address what be frankly matter of the utmost sensitivity involve highly vulnerable young girl will the secretary of state ensure that the operation and eventual finding of the report be communicate clearly responsibly and in timely manner to the public and that disinformation be actively counter to prevent political distortion the incitement of harm and the further diminution of public trust respect the hon member important point in fact inaccurate information be one of the issue that baroness casey raise whether it be about ethnicity or anything else inaccurate information can cause huge problem and the more we ensure that information be robust the well as the chair of the home affairs committee say baroness casey will also give evidence tomorrow so people will be able to hear directly from she as well as read her report the victim and survivor of groom gang and cse have be institutionally let down and we must ensure that they be front and centre in our approach join other colleague in say that court delay must be look at they be particular issue in west yorkshire and it be traumatic for the survivor baroness casey report on the smith algorithm develop by west yorkshire police which bring hundred of people into scope as victim and survivor and help prosecution rate will that good practice be share baroness casey be impress by the work that west yorkshire police have do use what it call the smith algorithm it be include in her report it look at risk factor such as child miss from home or school those with repeat miss episode and child in care and at area where risk be high it use that to identify people who might be victim of child groom and sexual abuse and exploitation and then to pursue that evidence west yorkshire police have have series of effective and successful prosecution that have put perpetrator behind bar so join my hon friend in welcome that work would like to ask the home secretary about the historical sexual abuse and child sexual abuse of sikh woman and child the sikh community have say that when sikh girl go to the local authority or the police they be tell even by the medium that it be an ethnic problem or that it be an asian problem welcome the fact that the home secretary will be record datum but what datum will that be will sikh girl who have be abuse no long just be tell that it be an asian problem welcome the hon member point it be immensely important that victim and survivor in every community of every ethnicity can get justice and the support they need and that issue around race and ethnicity be never use as an excuse to ignore victim or to fail to pursue criminal commit the most terrible crime we want to work with the police to ensure not only that we can get effective datum and recording on victim but that the right kind of service and support be in place so that every victim be hear be shocked that the conservatives do not seem able to recognise that they be in power for of the year to which louise casey refer in her report if they have have any kind of enthusiasm for an inquiry when they be in government they would have call one so we can dismiss they be my right hon friend confident that we be hear the voice of the victim the child and their parent when we have similar problem when be in local government back in the we set up thing call childline to give direct voice to young people so that they could raise their concern do she think that we should have similar thing here so that victim of child sexual exploitation can have their voice hear my hon friend make an important point on the history and the action that have be take one thing that baroness casey criticise in particular be report produce by the home office under the previous government she say that the conclusion that it come to be simply not justify by the datum and that the datum gather be inadequate think everyone should recognise that sufficient action have not be take be it on datum share or implement recommendation on victim and survivor the minister for safeguarding be do immensely important work to look at way of ensure that their voice can be at the heart of the new national inquiry and all home office work in this area do not believe that hear an answer to number of the question ask by the leader of the opposition so will ask the home secretary again when do baroness casey submit her finding and do the government request any change ten day ago and this be baroness casey independent report anybody who suggest that she would change her view and report for anyone have not meet she welcome the pace and focus that the home secretary have bring to baroness casey report she be right to highlight the risk of the online space and the rapidity with which it have become focus can she give assurance that protocol will change accordingly so that we look for the information that we do not know about and that the case of survivor and victim who have be criminalise will be quash so that those people do not carry conviction for the exploitation that they experience welcome my hon friend point about the need to ensure that victim be not criminalise for the coercion and crime commit against they that failure the tendency to blame victim for the appalling crime commit against they have be pervasive problem through the year we be look far at the issue of online grooming and exploitation which be escalate in complication more teenager themselves be involve in that exploitation it be more complicated to identify where people be be coerce and where they be actually criminal commit these crime it be amazing staggering that labour mp can come here today and welcome an inquiry yet when they be give the chance they all vote against one these girl the victim of the pakistani groom gang be kidnap abuse drug and rap and when they reach out for help everybody ignore they it be little wonder that they have no faith in the system but they can regain faith if the home secretary agree with and appoint maggie oliver as chair of the inquiry say to the hon member that child sexual exploitation and abuse be some of the most vile crime that our country face what baroness casey report set out in some detail over page be that there have be report after report after review after review but so many of the recommendation be never implement so concern that be raise at the time of the rotherham inquiry about issue around ethnicity lack of information sharing and lack of protection for child be simply not act on baroness casey herself say if we get this right year ago see these girl as child rap rather than wayward teenager then doubt we be in this place now the hon member be member of the previous government who fail to do that hope that he agree that successive government and agency across the country have fail to act we need to ensure that there be proper independent inquiry as well as most crucially of all action by police in the operation that will bring perpetrator to justice and put they behind bar thank my right hon friend the home secretary for her statement one of the question run through baroness casey audit be just why that type of offending have be allow to grow unchecked in our society but why people be drive to commit such vile crime can the home secretary assure that the government will commission serious thorough and consider research into the driver of group base child sexual exploitation include look at all the issue around ethnicity and age will those finding be share with the devolved administrations who as we have hear have not be exempt from these issue yes can say to my hon friend that we accept that recommendation in baroness casey report and we will commission research into the driver of child sexual exploitation and more widely violence against woman and girl so that we have strong evidence to keep child safe bradford and keighley taxis operate in skipton and south craven there have be some horrific case in that area will the home secretary confirm that the inquiry will not be restrict to bradford and the big conurbation in the uk we have crisis in our inquiry system they all take too long the covid inquiry be still ongoing which be an absolute scandal can she accelerate the timing will she give serious consideration to this public inquiry be hold in the north of england agree that there be challenge with inquiry that can take long time which mean that victim and survivor or those affect by the inquiry wait very long time for answer that be why it be critical that we introduce and implement recommendation from previous inquiry that we get on with it and strengthen police operation now to put perpetrator behind bar can also tell the right hon gentleman that we will not restrict where the inquiry go or where the commission choose to investigate welcome baroness casey audit and the government instigation of the national inquiry which must leave no stone unturned lead to conviction and lead to perpetrator and anybody complicit be put behind bar where as far as be concern they can rot it be also important that this most serious of issue demand serious and consider conduct from people in this place include not misrepresent what happen here will the home secretary confirm that if the reason amendment refer to by the leader of the opposition have pass it would not have lead to national inquiry it would have block child protection measure and it weaponise child rape to go after order call the home secretary we want action to be take across the board to make sure that child be protect and that the recommendation be introduce the children wellbeing and schools bill that the opposition vote against be an opportunity to implement two of the recommendation in baroness casey audit it be right that we implement those change to strengthen the protection of child and to keep young people safe welcome lot of what the home secretary have say today she keep refer to institutional failure in bradford in little girl star hobson be murder by her mother partner evidence come to light from neighbour and social service that the case be dismiss because it involve lesbian couple and people fear be accuse of be homophobic have also have issue in my constituency since the last election where social worker have be worried about the other label that they may get they have tick box and leave the child at the bottom ask the home secretary to consider that institutional failure where people be afraid to offend one group or another and they often lose sight of the fact that the child be the most important part of the care service crime be crime and the safety of child should always be paramount whatever the circumstance and we must always pursue the evidence that be why the mantra around police be to pursue the evidence without fear or favour and that be the standard that british policing have long apply that be the approach we always have to take to child safety wherever issue or concern be raise put on record my thank to baroness casey and the home secretary the first home secretary in year to come here with an independent review these girl now woman be abuse traumatise and then retraumatise by system that do little to protect they or help they get justice we should always put the life and safety of young girl before any political concern which be why welcome today decision will the home secretary lie out how predator and those who deny victim justice will be hold accountable follow this inquiry we must ensure that recommendation be implement one conclusion in the baroness casey audit state the timeline set out above that be the history of fail report in the past show pattern of case after case of offending that be prosecute review and then recommendation for improvement make and repeat but not follow through we become so used to hear about these issue that they become more about justification for failure rather than problem that need to be fix we must ensure that these problem be fix welcome the home secretary statement that those who be convict of such crime will not be able to take part in the asylum system and suggest that she may want to extend that to all crime against the person the question that my right hon friend the member for north west essex mrs badenoch ask be this will the home secretary ensure that no fallacious human right claim can be make that mean that these people can not be deport if convict of these crime we be strengthen the safeguard in the asylum system the system that we inherit be too weak and not strong enough to ensure not only that the rule be respect and enforce but to deal particularly with issue of criminality and public risk we be strengthen those safeguard include the law around sexual offence and we be look particularly at issue around the way article be be interpret we be also strengthen public protection arrangement we be bring in new arrangement to ensure that should any issue be raise by the police or other about any safety risk or anybody in the asylum system joint public protection agreement and arrangement between the police and immigration enforcement people can be keep safe welcome the clarity and focus on action that the home secretary have bring to the house this morning speak to the father of young woman in my constituency who be the victim of child sexual exploitation he think that this be the right way forward but his concern and mine be for those victim and survivor whose trauma will be open up again by the process as he put it when you open pandora box you ve get to have the tool to deal with whatever come out will the home secretary say more about the tool that she will put in place to support the survivor at the heart of this issue my hon friend make an important point too often victim and survivor have be ask to tell their story often to multiple agency and then have see no action which simply strengthen the distress that they feel seven thousand victim and survivor give evidence to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse as we draw up the arrangement for the national inquiry we will work closely as will the safeguarding minister the under secretary of state for the home department jess phillips to keep victim and survivor in our mind we must ensure that they have support and that the point my hon friend have raise on behalf of her constituent and for the victim and their family be take seriously welcome the home secretary statement specifically about allow the nca to head the operation with partner agency and work across all region as barrister have speak to many nca officer and law enforcement officer and one consistent criticism be that they do not have enough resource this will be an enormous investigation up and down the country so will the home secretary assure the house that the resource that those officer will need to complete the investigation will not be limit we have already provide some additional resource for policing so that officer will be able to undertake the assessment and identification of case that be close but need to be reopen or where other line of inquiry need to be follow up the hon gentleman will know that the national crime agency already do immensely important work through operation stovewood around south yorkshire and through its work on online child abuse we need to bring all the different programme of work close together involve both the national crime agency and the new centre for public protection that we be set up which will be about set new standard across the country and roll out the national operating model that all force can then follow commend the home secretary for the dignified way in which she give her statement associate myself with her apology to the victim and survivor of sexual exploitation and groom gang for past failure welcome the government have accept the recommendation of baroness casey rapid audit and the announcement of national criminal operation to pursue and convict perpetrator justice for victim of these horrific crime must always be our top priority west yorkshire police have take proactive approach to secure justice for victim as recently as january this year eight man be give jail sentence of nearly year for multiple sexual offence against two child in keighley in the will she join in commend the work of west yorkshire police in bring the perpetrator of those vile crime to justice my hon friend be right to highlight the work of west yorkshire police they have do pioneer work to find new way to identify victim who may be at risk and to summon evidence where there be repeat miss case and they have be forensic and determine in pursuit of action commend the work of the assistant chief constable learn from the work that the police have do we want to make baroness casey recommendation central part of the national criminal operation the sexual exploitation of vulnerable child in this country be stain upon our society and the victim want not just the truth out but transparency with that in mind will the home secretary confirm whether the government ask baroness casey to change any element of her report yes or no this be baroness casey independent report the whole point about ask somebody like baroness casey to do an independent report be that we know that they will come to their own conclusion not anybody else as the hon gentleman will see the report have baroness casey forthright style and conclusion in her evidence tomorrow at the home affairs committee think she will make it clear that these be her conclusion pay tribute to victim survivor and campaigner be year old and it have take be that age for to be able to talk about some of the abuse that happen when be child as one of the countless victim live with the impact of groom sexual and psychological abuse find it gall to watch tory and reform members who never once lift no you do not one finger lift order you be talk through the chair please ask quick question as there remain colleague who hope to contribute find it gall that those member have appoint themselves as defender of abused people for political gain do the home secretary agree that neither history nor the british people will be kind to the sicken political opportunism that we have see from the conservative and reform party thank my hon friend for speak out about his experience to speak out as victim of child abuse in that way be immensely difficult and think everyone should listen to what victim and survivor have to say thank he for speak out because by do so he provide strength and inspiration to other victim and survivor across the country and pay tribute to he for do so he be right that this should be something that everyone can agree on because it be about the protection of child and the tackling of serious crime hope all of we can do that with respect and together hope something else we can all agree on be our admiration for the former labour mp ann cryer who expose what be go on back in which be only five year into year long labour government and be disgracefully smear as racist for do so let we belatedly make an apology to she and thank she for her courage do thank my former honourable friend ann cryer because she do speak out and stand up for child who be be abuse it be because of that that recognise as part of the response make to the child abuse inquiry and again today that this have be historic failure over very many decade just as recognise that historic failure which everyone should recognise hope the right hon gentleman will persuade those on his front bench also to recognise the historic failure and to take some responsibility it be really sad that the leader of the opposition do not choose to respond to or join in the historic apology in which be cross party apology involve the former home secretary be really sorry that she choose not to do so today very much welcome the home secretary call national inquiry be particularly take with baroness casey first recommendation that child must be see as child be extremely concerned by the number of case she have identify that be drop because those child be see as consent to sex with their perpetrator will the home secretary reassure that those case will be open and look at immediately and that we do not have to wait for the outcome of the national inquiry can tell my hon friend that we be work with the lord chancellor on take forward this recommendation now and not wait for any further local inquiry baroness casey be really clear that the adultification of child treat they as consent to something into which they be coerce and in which they be exploit lie at the heart of lot of the institutional failure to take this crime seriously that be why we need to change the law but we also need to change attitude because some of the case that baroness casey refer to be recent and that can not go on the home secretary refer to this inquiry as national inquiry but it be not be it the inquiry term of reference and scope will exclude concern about groom and organise sexual exploitation in northern ireland whether by foreign national paramilitary group or other be that less important to this government will the legislative change increase the statutory rape age to apply across the whole united kingdom the hon and learn member will understand that home office responsibility around police and crime cover england and wales the safeguarding minister will be follow up with the devolved administration and it will be for they to decide how they want to take these issue forward include in northern ireland the lord chancellor will consult in the normal way with devolved administration on change to the law any and every instance of child sexual exploitation should shame all of we but think what so many of we find particularly horrific about the grooming gang scandal be the fact that those crime continue to be perpetrate because of failure to act by stakeholder and agency that have completely indefensible preconceive notion about the victim they be speak to as such welcome the government follow the evidence not the politic first in appoint baroness casey to conduct the review and then in ensure that we do not shy away from national inquiry when she have call for one will the home secretary ensure that the inquiry have all the power it need to compel any and every stakeholder who potentially play part in walk on by from this scandal to take part and give evidence and will she legislate where necessary so that anyone who be show to have play part in those victim not get the justice they deserve to begin with be accountable before the law my hon friend be right that those attitude towards teenage girl towards child and treat they as adult still persist baroness casey quote serious case review of case involve teenager online she be just or year old and be be draw into the most explicit and abusive chatroom and pornographic site online this be treat as somehow be the child choice even though there be evidence of exploitation and crime take place we have to ensure that we do more to protect our teenager and we will bring in the mandatory duty to report to strengthen the law in that area call dr ben spencer to ask the final question thank the home secretary for her statement and for change her mind on the need for national inquiry she have have the casey report for the past day could she lay out what evidence in that report be most persuasive in change her mind or if she reach that conclusion independent of the report which factor lead she to do so that be an important question undertake to this house in january that would look far at how to ensure that local investigation have the power they need to compel witness or evidence that be raise with we by member of this house but also by mayor to ensure that those investigation could properly get to the truth we pursue that and look at other power those in the local government act inspection power and so on all those power have complexity attach to they so we ask baroness casey to look at this issue as well as the response we get from local authority we look at that evidence but also ask baroness casey to look at it as well and make final recommendation that be why we have agree with baroness casey recommendation to have national inquiry in place iran israel conflict with permission madam deputy speaker will remind the house that the foreign office have be respond to two crisis in this past week the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer will update the house on the government extensive effort to assist those whose loved one lose their life in thursday devastate air india plane crash just nine

signpost border crossing point and we be send rapid deployment team to egypt and jordan to bolster our consular presence near the border with israel that presence have already be support british national on the ground israel and iran have close their airspace until further notice and our ability to provide support in iran be therefore extremely limited british national in the region should closely monitor our travel advice for further update the situation remain fast move we expect more strike in the day to come this be moment of grave danger for the region want to be clear the united kingdom be not involve in the strike against iran this be military action conduct by israel it should come as no surprise that israel consider the iranian nuclear programme an existential threat khamenei say in that israel be cancerous tumour that should be remove and eradicate we have always support israeli security that be why britain have seek to prevent iran obtain nuclear weapon through extensive diplomacy we agree with president trump when he say that negotiation be necessary and must lead to deal that have long be the view of the so call britain and france and germany with whom we have work so closely on this issue it be the view of all the which have back the effort of president trump envoy steve witkoff for more than two decade it have be the cross party view in this house lord cameron of chipping norton and lord hague of richmond lead diplomatic effort on this issue as do baroness may of maidenhead and the former right hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip this government have continue to pursue negotiation join france and germany in five round of talk with iran this year alone ours be hard headed realist assessment of how good to tackle this grave threat fundamentally no military action can put an end to iran nuclear capability just last week the international atomic energy agency board of governor pass non compliance resolution against iran the first such iaea finding in year the director general comprehensive report detail iran failure to declare nuclear material iran remain the only state without nuclear weapon accumulate uranium at such dangerously high level its total enriched stockpile be now time the limit in the joint comprehensive plan of action its nuclear programme be part of wide pattern of destabilising activity the government have take firm action in response when iran transfer ballistic missile for use in russia illegal war in ukraine we impose extensive sanction include against iran air and we cancel our bilateral air service agreement in the face of unacceptable islamic revolutionary guard corps threat here in the uk there have be some foiled plot since the crown prosecution service have for the first time charge iranian national under the national security act and we have place the iranian state include the irgc on the enhance tier of the new foreign influence registration scheme widen war would have grave and unpredictable consequence include for our partner in jordan and the gulf the horror of gaza worsening tension in lebanon syria and iraq rise and the houthi threat continue that be why the government firm view be as it be last october at the time of the ballistic missile attack on israel that further escalation in the middle east be not in britain interest or in the interest of israel iran or the region there be hundred of thousand of british national live in the region and with iran major oil producer and with oil flow through the strait of hormuz account for fifth of total world oil consumption escalate conflict pose real risk for the global economy as missile rain down israel have right to defend itself and its citizen but our priority now be de escalation our message to both israel and iran be clear step back show restraint and do not get pull ever deeply into catastrophic conflict the consequence of which no one can control the prime minister chair cobra to

neighbour and sovereign palestinian state as part of two state solution diplomacy be indispensable to each of those goal britain will keep press all side to choose diplomatic path out of this crisis commend this statement to the house call the shadow foreign secretary these be deeply dangerous time and as the foreign secretary have say last week iaea report make it abundantly clear that iran nuclear programme have grow its stockpile of uranium have pass kg and be enrich to purity which have be widely note as level unprecedented for state without nuclear weapon and as be beyond the amount need for any civilian use the iaea director general have say that iran action and its failure to co operate have lead to significant reduction in the agency ability to verify whether its nuclear programme be entirely peaceful we share those concern and the reason why iran must never obtain nuclear weapon be clear the iranian regime be prolific state sponsor of terrorism with state intention of annihilate the world only jewish state give the concern and the clear threat that iran pose not only to israel but to wide regional stability israel have the right to act in self defence to degrade iran nuclear infrastructure as well as pose threat to israel iran pose direct threat to the united kingdom and our interest the minister for the middle east state in write parliamentary answer in april that iran nuclear programme have never be more advanced and threaten international peace and security early this month the strategic defence review state that iran escalate nuclear programme present risk to international security and the global non proliferation architecture with that in mind can the foreign secretary tell we what discussion he have have with the iaea and give we his assessment of how close iran be to have nuclear weapon capability that could strike israel and our interest in the region give the report from the iaea early this week what direct bilateral discussion do government ministers have with their israeli counterpart on this matter prior to the action that be undertake last week the foreign secretary have speak about the conversation he have have since

example what discussion have he have with our friend in bahrain in the light of the comprehensive security integration and prosperity agreement and with jordan in the light of the previous airspace violation by iran be those discussion purely diplomatic or do they cover defence and military planning last week on june the minister for the middle east say during his statement that the government be in contact with the israeli government that day as that be after the iaea report be publish on june can the foreign secretary say whether the nuclear threat from iran and the iaea assessment be discuss or be they discuss other matter we also know from recent statement by the minister for the middle east that relation between this government and israel have become strained since last july what message do the foreign secretary have for all those who be concerned that constructive dialogue and diplomacy with israel be not take place on british national in israel and the wide region what effort be under way to expeditiously help those who want to return to the uk although the foreign secretary can not give operational detail to the house can he confirm whether contingency plan for the evacuation of british personnel and asset from iran have be update recently at the will the prime minister have substantive bilateral discussion with president trump on this matter iran strike on israel be indiscriminately target civilian and the whole house should condemn iran for do this the uk have previously support israel defend it from missile and drone attack have the uk offer military intelligence and other form of assistance to our israeli ally to counter the attack from iran the german chancellor have offer that and be provide assistance to israel have the uk make such an offer too it be right that uk military capability increase in the region over the weekend can the foreign secretary tell the house whether he be prepared to tackle any retaliation from iran and its proxy include the houthis although iran nuclear capability have be degrade we know that it be in regular contact with china and russia on nuclear issue and have be for some time have the foreign secretary assess whether russia and china may have be involve in support iran nuclear programme to get it to where it be today be he concerned that they will support iran with material and expertise so that it can rebuild its capability follow israel action and be he look at apply new sanction to constrain iran ability to rebuild advance and accelerate its nuclear ambition turn to the direct threat that iran pose to the uk the foreign secretary have rightly mention the plot foil the recent arrest and put iran on the enhance tier of firs can he give an assurance about the work take place across government include with the home office the police counter terrorism operation and the intelligence service to tackle any retaliation that iran the irgc and those act on its behalf might direct towards we have the threat risk level be reassess and be extra support be provide to secure synagogue school and other part of the jewish community in the uk finally we all want to see peace and stability in the region where iran be responsible for so much of the bloodshed that be now take place so can the foreign secretary update the house on the ongoing step be take to secure the return of the hostage from hamas captivity on the work to get more aid into gaza and on the effort to bring about sustainable ceasefire be very grateful to the shadow foreign secretary for her remark for the cross party support that sense in they and for her question which will certainly endeavour to answer the shadow foreign secretary ask about our contact with the iaea can confirm speak to director general grossi just few day ago certainly before the action last week and discuss his report she ask what the late be on that she will know that the assessment be that the enriched uranium stockpile be now stand at kg which be more than time the limit in the joint comprehensive plan of action with the total stockpile consider to be nine significant quantity of highly enriched uranium the shadow foreign secretary ask what co ordination we have do give that information and want to reassure she that have be in close touch and work in concert with my french and german colleague over this period with the three of we co ordinate our work across our political director but also as foreign ministers in our messaging to the iranian regime can also confirm to she that we will be speak to the iranian regime again in the come hour to raise those concern and heighten what say about the need for diplomacy at this time the shadow foreign secretary quite properly ask about our long stand relationship with bahrain and can confirm that the minister for the middle east have speak to bahrain she ask about our long stand relationship with jordan and can confirm that have speak to foreign minister safadi in the last few day we continue to co ordinate with our jordanian friend and to offer they whatever support we can at this time the shadow foreign secretary obviously ask about our ongoing relationship with israel she will know that our relationship with israel remain complex and intense one as she would expect have speak to foreign minister on numerous occasion and of course speak to he again on saturday when he be in bunker and separate from his family offer he condolence as hon member would expect the united kingdom and israel co ordinate and work together in such time we have disagreement of course we have discuss that over the dispatch box particularly about the humanitarian situation in gaza but we recognise that as we speak there be many israelis in their bunker there have be casualty over this last period and over people injure there be sense of trauma compound trauma in israel and want to reassure the shadow foreign secretary that we recognise that the prime minister be of course discuss these issue with president trump at this time and the meeting be go on we as speak also want to reassure the shadow foreign secretary about our contact with hostage meet hostage family just today and undertake to raise that issue again in this place they ask to ensure that with this crisis we do not take our eye off the situation in gaza that be why make it part of my statement the shadow foreign secretary quite rightly ask about state threat from the iranian regime and the irgc refer she to the work of jon hall who have find gap in our legislative framework in relation to how we deal with these state threat be pleased about the arrest that have be make recently but we will be come forward with the appropriate legislation to deal with the state threat from the irgc in the come month call the chair of the foreign affairs committee it be completely understandable that israel feel threaten by bellicose neighbour with uranium mine and nuclear programme but the rest of the world be unanimous in say that the way to deal with iran be through discussion negotiation and nuclear agreement there once be such deal thank to the extraordinary effort of baroness cathy ashton among other but that deal be derail by president trump egg on by israel now belatedly even president trump have come to the view that the solution have to be nuclear agreement with iran secure through discussion and diplomacy yet in the middle of that israel have decide that the solution be regional war do the foreign secretary agree that britain must remain firm with the rest of the world in urge both israel and iran to step back from conflict military action can predict only one thing it will not stop the iranian nuclear programme but it will ensure the death of innocent victim on both side my right hon friend be right to put on record our thank to former eu high representative baroness ashton for all her work to get the jcpoa agreement the previous government and successive leader of the conservative party also work to secure that agreement it be hugely important that we get back to diplomacy it be right to say though that the assessment of the iaea be that there have be deception from the iranian regime how do you account for have stockpile that be time over what they should be if you be stick to the agreement that be why we must come together yes call for restraint but we do need diplomatic action iran can not have nuclear capability full stop call the liberal democrat spokesperson be grateful to the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement and to he ministers and official from the department for their effort to support british citizen in the region people across the uk have watch with horror as war have break out between israel and iran as we consider the uk response let begin with key principle on which hope the house will agree the state of israel have right to exist and to defend itself in line with international law we stand against iran state goal to wipe out the state of israel and its use of the islamic revolutionary guard corps to support global terrorism and foster regional instability will the foreign secretary go far to protect uk resident include iranian and jewish community from irgc sponsor terrorist action on our soil and finally proscribe the irgc iran ambition to create nuclear weapon be grave risk to the uk interest and israel survival successive government have be right to seek to contain that risk through diplomatic mean however the netanyahu government unilateral military action which they take against the advice of ally and without forewarn have severely undermine those effort it be ill judge reckless and not the behaviour of responsible ally can the foreign secretary confirm that the prime minister will press at today summit for return to negotiation with the uk include alongside the us iran have now retaliate with its own strike and may look to respond far include by threaten the asset of other state in the region can the foreign secretary confirm that the sole purpose of uk military deployment will be to protect our asset personnel and citizen and that he will not allow we to be draw into the conflict between israel and iran what specific step be the foreign secretary take to ensure that while the focus be on this crisis we do not lose sight of the need to secure the unconditional release of the hostage hold by hamas and to maintain scrutiny of the extreme action of the netanyahu government towards palestinians in gaza east jerusalem and the west bank and in order to protect the possibility of two state solution will the uk government hee the call of all liberal democrat mps for the immediate recognition of palestine be grateful to the hon gentleman for his remark and the tone with which he make they because in matter of war it be always important that this house can speak with one voice on proscription refer he to the work of jon hall and remind he that we be deal with state threat to be absolutely clear no country in the world be deploy more state threat across the world than iran that be why it be important to look at that issue specifically he have find gap in our architecture we be look at those gap and we will come forward with our plan shortly the hon gentleman rightly talk about the important work of negotiation and diplomacy and what sit behind that it be absolutely right that we continue to work with france and germany reassure he that that work have continue and be continue alongside parallel track if you like the work of president trump envoy steve witkoff we applaud that work and that effort to get to negotiate diplomatic solution but it be solution that will require iran give up its nuclear capability it will involve iran get serious about what those centrifuge under mountain be really for we be very serious about that that be what we be insistent on and why we say there would be snapback and we would impose very severe sanction that those sanction would hit iran once again if we do not see compliance the hon gentleman put on record his view on gaza we have have those exchange many time across the chamber welcome the work of the foreign secretary and the diplomatic action that have take place so far israel unprovoked attack on iran have open yet another dangerous front and risk drag the entire region into wide war with devastating consequence for ordinary people across the middle east people who have already bear decade of conflict and intervention give that israel claim have be challenge even by us intelligence assessment can the foreign secretary assure the house that no uk military support whether direct or indirect will be give without the clear and explicit consent of this house and that the government have learn the hard lesson of iraq and libya and will not repeat they say to my hon friend categorically that the uk be not involve in israel strike we do have an important regional role we have uk asset in cyprus bahrain and qatar and we have an important role in operation shader where we be deal with terrible threat to we and our ally from daesh and other we have important relationship in the gulf and the wide region that be why the defence secretary have as precautionary step send further military aid to the area until the people of iran rise up and overthrow the dreadful mullah regime it be obviously true what the foreign secretary say when he say that no military action can put an end to iran nuclear ambition because even if its capacity be entirely destroy iran could start rebuild it have say that though it be true that it be possible to contain those ambition by knock back iran capacity repeatedly until such time as it no long wish to acquire nuclear weapon advise the foreign secretary to think carefully about the question of diplomacy alone contain those ambition because one day we might wake up and find that successful nuclear test have be carry out by iran be always prepared to take friendly advice from the right hon gentleman this be very serious threat we know that the jcpoa have be breach president trump have be pretty clear in his expectation as have be pretty clear with the iranian foreign minister recognise that if iran be to take the off ramp it must get serious in the come day about its obligation to the international community and about end that nuclear capability as always civilian be pay the heavy price there be casualty on october with at least hostage since there have be casualty in gaza this

saudi arabia and france on the two state solution have now be delay what be we do to get that back on track and how will we progress that solution recognise that my hon friend have long be champion of these issue he be right that the french alongside the saudi arabians take the decision to postpone the conference which think be the right decision as my hon friend will understand many partner particularly arab partner and partner in the levant want to be in their country at this time there be lot of diplomacy he will have hear the list of country have be speak to we must focus our effort both on ensure that ceasefire in israel and gaza and on deal with iran nuclear capability rise order urge colleague to keep their question short and the foreign secretary to keep his answer short do our close ally the united states agree with this position on the situation if not what do we differ on refer the hon gentleman to the remark make by secretary rubio on the outbreak of this new war and to the statement make by donald trump in which he clearly indicate an off ramp for iran if it get serious about diplomacy and accept the olive branch that he extend through steve witkoff ealing have long have big iranian diaspora in when england do not qualify in the world cup and iran do lot of my classmate be support the latter now they be my adult constituent and they have be catch up in all this could my right hon friend tell what step he be take to ensure the safe passage of our constituent back home include one of my constituent who need to resume her cancer treatment and want urgently to come back to england let just put on the record the huge admiration that be sure many across this house have for what be formerly know as persia and the great history of the iranian people how remarkable they be and how awful it be that they be suffer under this horrendous regime unfortunately as my hon friend know the airspace over iran be close at the moment we have advise against travel to iran for many many year because of our concern however our embassy staff will do all they can to support british national call the father of the house the foreign secretary know that many of we have be prepare to speak up again and again on behalf of suffer palestinians and be critical friend of israel but will he agree that on this occasion we must stand shoulder to shoulder with our israeli ally the fact be iran be death cult and death cult like the nazis or iran can not be appease simply through diplomacy iran be cock snook at we it be inch away from nuclear bomb be sure he be go to make this absolutely clear but will the foreign secretary therefore stand shoulder to shoulder with israel and our american ally in proclaim the right of israel to exist at all absolutely thank you painful lesson of israeli and indeed jewish history be that when someone say that they want to destroy they we must believe they the iranian regime have make its intention to destroy israel clear for decade now we will all be familiar with the term never again which come out of the concentration camp of europe do the secretary of state agree that this be one of those moment where we can say that never again be now be grateful to my hon friend who have work on these issue for many year long before he come to this place we recognise the threat that israel be face and we also recognise the tremendous threat to not just israel and the region if iran be to get nuclear weapon and what it would mean for all of we who have work so hard against nuclear proliferation as where iran lead other would come in its wake we must stop that happen thank the foreign secretary for his statement today although we clearly have difference with the netanyahu regime israel be close ally and friend of the united kingdom iran be terrorist support state hezbollah hamas the houthis assad that be destabilise the region reject the iaea and international proposal to prevent nuclear proliferation and limit uranium enrichment and sponsor terrorist action on the street of britain do the foreign secretary not feel that israel be now do the world dirty work on behalf of we all the right hon gentleman bring his usual eloquence to these matter agree with he save for his initial remark would not call it the israel regime it be democracy with all the up and down and fault of any democracy of course recognise that this be an existential threat for israel and its people which be why it be important that we ask for restraint at this time because we do not want to see regional escalation that be why it be important that diplomacy prevail the iranian regime threaten peace and security around the world it destabilise the middle east through its terrorist proxy hamas hezbollah and the houthis it support russia invasion of ukraine and it be swear to wipe israel off the face of the earth it must never be allow to have nuclear bomb do the foreign secretary agree that that aim should be achieve through diplomacy and that all the world effort must be place on tehran to back down sign deal and end this conflict yes do welcome the foreign secretary statement the iranian regime be malignant international force who know how many british life have be lose to its sponsorship of international terrorism the iranians have explicitly state threat towards our asset and our people in the middle east how much confidence do the foreign secretary have in our ability to mitigate those threat have huge confidence in our force protection measure remind the hon gentleman that we have important military and intelligence asset in the region and bilateral defence relationship with jordan saudi arabia oman the uae qatar bahrain kuwait iraq lebanon egypt and of course israel be concerned about my constituent natasha joshua and jemma who be stick in israel after travel there for wedding they send desperate message say that they be worried about their safety and be face daily cascade of missile they have register their presence with the foreign office have hear what the foreign secretary have say today but could ask he to publicly reassure their family in my constituency that he be do all he can to bring british national home to safety for iranian dual national british national who be in iran as say casualty just over the last two day and injury this be of course terrifying time as people hide in their home that be why we have embassy staff work around the clock and we of course offer our full support notwithstanding that the airspace be currently close have be contact by significant number of constituent who be currently strand in israel unable to leave because of the lack of flight to the united kingdom this include constituent with significant medical need urge the foreign secretary to far strengthen the foreign office offer do welcome the advice it be now provide on route back to the uk although note that it have take some time for that to happen what contingency plan be the foreign office and wide government undertaking for repatriation should the situation deteriorate far and that be require and be they register detail of uk national in israel to that end reassure the right hon gentleman that we be ask all uk national in israel to register their presence so that we know that they be there and can update they in what be very fast move situation also reassure he that we have send rapid force of diplomat to the border to facilitate exit as he will understand the airspace be close so there be no way of leave by commercial flight but there be route particularly out of jordan and we will do all we can to facilitate that the chancellor confirm yesterday that uk military asset could potentially be use to help defend israel we be send military aircraft to the middle east and the prime minister have not rule out they be use to help israel the minister for the armed forces recently confirm in response to write question that the uk be train israel defence forces personnel on uk base training course do the foreign secretary acknowledge that through bolster israel military in this way we be actively demonstrate our support for one side in this conflict and do he therefore accept that this undermine our call for diplomatic solution and de escalation it be important to state that the uk do not participate and be not participate in israeli strike but we do have proper role to play in regional security my hon friend would not expect to comment on operational defence and intelligence matter except to pray in aid the defence bilateral relationship that we have in the region the reality be that there be long history of diplomacy be use as cover to reach the ultimate aim of what country want to do for example russia sign the intermediate range nuclear force treaty while constantly build hundred of nuclear weapon make that treaty worthless want to put it on the record that israel have my absolute full support in the action that it be take it be do the world dirty work be the foreign secretary and his right hon friend the defence secretary in the middle of work out how we ensure that the strait of hormuz stay open for vital international trade be grateful to the right hon member for put square the economic interest that we have at this time and highlight why diplomacy be so important against that backdrop the price of oil have jump to barrel and some be predict it go up to barrel that would certainly be the case if the strait of hormuz be block that be why this be so delicate let we be under no doubt that this affect british people at the pump and that there would be massive inflationary growth if that be to happen the death of palestinians iranians and israelis this weekend show why we must all push for peace and stop this from spiral out of control do the foreign secretary support as do nuclear free middle east if so what step be the government take to also address israel vast nuclear arsenal which be think to include at least nuclear bomb and which let we not forget one israeli minister say should be use against the people of gaza what be the foreign secretary do about israel refusal to sign up to the nuclear non proliferation treaty and to co operate with the international atomic energy agency have to say to the hon member the story of israel nuclear ability go back some long way to the remember study this many year ago we work with israel and we remain country that do not want to see nuclear proliferation we will do everything we can to ensure that other do not get nuclear capability in the region let we be clear there be no good guy in this conflict the concept of pre emptive self defence do not exist in international law and nor should it israel decision unilaterally to retaliate first have make the region indeed the world much more dangerous and unstable place to what extent do the foreign secretary believe that the impunity that israel have enjoy for previous act of aggression and war crime be factor in netanyahu decision to retaliate first we have have very serious debate in this house so far that recognise the serious threat that iran nuclear capability pose to the global community and the existential threat that the israeli people be face have be absolutely clear that diplomacy be the way donald trump be urge path back to diplomacy the uk be of course not involve but we have to be mindful about the many people in both israel and iran who be hide in their bunker fear the loss of their life be sure the whole house be behind the diplomatic effort of the prime minister and the government to avoid any further escalation of this conflict and thank my right hon friend for the reassurance he have give about not take his eye off the horror that continue to unfold in gaza can he give guarantee today that if there be to be an escalation that would drag the uk into any conflict vote in this house would be hold first before our armed force be deploy as this conflict escalate our message to both israel and iran be very clear de escalation and restraint all our thought be of course with the british citizen catch up in this horrible and alarming exchange of ordnance the foreign secretary say he be keep his eye on gaza but be not quite sure what that mean it be certainly the case that the eye of the world have be draw to the footage that have emerge as the missile have fly footage of young child shoot and bleed out their life in the sand of gaza as he say people be hospitalise over the weekend or shoot dead while beg for food just this morning people be kill while queue for food or attempt to obtain food from the new american sponsor distribution system what comfort should all the bereaved family in gaza take from the fact that he be keep his eye on this situation today in my office be with hostage family wonderful woman who lose her husband be there with her daughter ask to keep gaza at the forefront of my mind and to raise it in the chamber this afternoon that be why there be an extensive part of my speech on it have speak to all partner in the region and will very shortly speak again to prime minister mustafa we be absolutely clear that aid need to get in that hostage need to get out and that we want to see ceasefire will continue to talk and work particularly with our american partner and our partner in qatar to bring about that ceasefire have spend nearly year in this chamber watch our country plead with the israeli government to de escalate in gaza they have not strong word and desperate plea have not work be now the time to recognise the state of palestine as we promise in our manifesto be now the time to extend last week welcome sanction to other member of netanyahu regime include the prime minister himself if not now when understand my hon friend strength of feeling on palestinian recognition she will know we have always be clear that there be role for recognition as part of process and we will continue to work with ally in the region and in europe to bring about the process that will bring about recognition and the two state that we hold dear rise order we have only another minute to go so long question be just take away time from other colleague thank the foreign secretary for his statement and welcome in particular the measure about bolster our consular support he have also make reference to our asset and the hundred of thousand of british citizen in the wide region what reassurance can he give we that their wellbeing be be think about and that preparation be be make should the conflict escalate far let put on record my huge gratitude and respect for our diplomatic staff in israel and iran and across the region and for their family and child who provide they with such support to be absolutely clear on monday last week we have tabletop exercise in whitehall on iran which chair there be contingency plan none of we could have envisage two crisis at the same time this one and india which the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer will talk about shortly but our staff be stand ready know that my right hon friend will be work tirelessly and use all his diplomatic skill and those of his office to resolve this new immediate crisis but as other have say how will he balance that with get aid in permanent ceasefire get hostage out and recognition balance it we must because those be the issue that we be currently deal with we remain determined to press for what we want to see in gaza and to stand up for those we be hugely concerned about in the west bank my hon friend will have see the statement make last week in relation to that as well as be absolutely clear about iran intent and capability at this time and what we must do to stop that agree with the foreign secretary that nuclear armed iran be not in israel national security interest or in the security interest of other country in the region or indeed of this country which have receive direct threat from the current iranian regime some uk national be live on raf akrotiri along with cypriot and other also work on base some civilian most in uniform what reassurance can he give those on the base that they be safe from iranian threat the right hon member will know that work with partner we have capability that can ensure that our people be as safe as they need to be he be right to reference raf akrotiri the work of our colleague in cyprus bahrain and qatar be hugely important at this time when the un nuclear watchdog say that iran be close in on the ability to develop up to nine nuclear weapon worry do the foreign secretary agree that it be in our national interest that iran never acquire those nuclear weapon yes we all watch in horror as the conflict between israel and iran escalate today we have hear strong call in the house for the uk to be prevail voice of restraint and diplomacy in this fragile and volatile time while everyone in the chamber recognise the brutal nature of the iranian regime the focus must be on de escalation so be concerned to hear about raf jet be send to the middle east will the foreign secretary make it clear that the uk will play no part in any aggression will he explicitly rule out any further military support for the israeli government this be precautionary measure the government would be irresponsible if we do not account for all possibility at this time the failure to get transparent information from the united nations special commission and the united nations monitoring verification and inspection commission cause untold damage year ago what discussion have my right hon friend the foreign secretary have with director general grossi at the international atomic energy agency to ensure that there be real transparency and real information on which we can base any action my hon friend will be pleased to hear that speak to the director general at the beginning of last week reassure he of our full support and thank he for all his work that be ensure common understanding of what iran be do and why we have to act do the foreign secretary agree that just as russia be run by an authoritarian regime that want to destroy its democratic neighbour ukraine and have carry out attack on british soil so iran be run by an authoritarian regime that be out to destroy its democratic neighbour and have also carry out attack on british soil be it not the case therefore that for the same reason we stand with ukraine we need to stand with israel now the right hon gentleman put it well we should also mention what those in iran be do to destabilise neighbouring country yemen syria lebanon and iraq with their proxy we absolutely have to keep our guard up in relation to iran my constituent will be extremely concerned by the development in the region so thank my right hon friend for his statement and the effort he be make to encourage de escalation will he assure that this escalate conflict will not undermine the uk effort to end the war in gaza free the hostage and lift all restriction to humanitarian aid in palestine yes will do all that can it be report that the israeli government plan to kill the leader of iran over the weekend as history show attempt to collapse regime with nothing to put in its place risk create power vacuum and state collapse they also risk create further wave of refugee and instability in the energy market what assessment have the foreign secretary make of those report and the wide implication that such strategy would have on the uk remain hugely concerned about the appalling human right record of the iranian regime but who run iran must quite properly be matter for the people of iran do my right hon friend agree that it be right that the uk as part of the international community come together to urge all side to show restraint through diplomacy to prevent iran acquire nuclear weapon and that it be also right that our focus be not divert from israel continue assault on gaza and the rest of occupy palestine and from secure the release of the hostage back to their family every colleague have speak to over the last few day have emphasise diplomacy and de escalation reassure my hon friend of that will the foreign secretary confirm that the state of israel have declare policy on its nuclear weapon of no first use and that there be no evidence that it have ever misuse or threaten to misuse its nuclear weapon in any irresponsible way whatsoever do he agree moreover that in international law there be the right of pre emptive military action and it be hard to imagine how that would not apply in this case give iran determination to destroy the state of israel the hon gentleman bring tremendous experience to these matter but he will understand that it be right and appropriate that leave that to the international lawyer the nuclear ambition of bloodthirsty terrorist sponsor regime in tehran pose real threat to world peace but do the foreign secretary agree that israel own conduct as an increasingly rogue state when it come to international law endanger not just israeli citizen but the palestinian citizen of gaza as we have see over the weekend and make the case for palestinian state more urgent not less israel have be raise its concern about iran for year it be an existential threat and one that we recognise which be why we have be work in concert with our partner in france and germany on this issue for so long and it have remain cross party issue this be obviously dangerous and perilous time and we need to do everything we can to bring about ceasefire between israel and iran can the foreign secretary assure we that no british weapon or component be be use to bomb iran which could be use as pretext for say that britain be directly involve what assurance have he have from the government of israel that they will not use or even consider use in any way the nuclear weapon that they possess we have the most robust export licensing regime in the world and be proud of that that be matter that this house vote on just few year ago under the last government and the right hon gentleman will know that we make decision to restrict arm sale to israel that could be use in gaza also refer he to the statement that have make about iran nuclear intent the work of the iaea the huge global concern and the un resolution that the uk do so much to secure last report june vol correction thank the foreign secretary for his statement and for the government calm leadership on these ever change and seriously concern matter give our close maritime connection can he update the house on his discussion with our gulf ally and partner can reassure my hon friend that have speak to partner in jordan saudi arabia oman uae qatar iraq lebanon and israel and be in touch of course with our friend in egypt over this last period and will continue to do so at this time of intense diplomacy we know that iran have the ballistic missile to hit europe let alone israel or other part of the middle east last week the iaea report that iran be within whisker of produce atomic weapon in the absence of diplomatic effort and the failure to introduce the snapback mechanism israel have right to react to protect itself will the foreign secretary now look at the diplomatic effort to introduce the snapback mechanism and to impose sanction on iran to ensure that it can not ever obtain nuclear weapon yes will thank the foreign secretary for his commitment to de escalation and particularly thank my hon friend the minister for the middle east who have work so hard over the last few day could the foreign secretary say little more about our commitment to our long stand friend and ally in the region particularly country such as bahrain be grateful to my hon friend for ask that question because this be very tense time if you be in jordan the uae saudi arabia bahrain or cyprus for that reason it be hugely important that the uk meet its obligation and that be why the defence secretary make the decision he do to deploy certain asset into the region of course we should uphold the right of every state to live in peace but in what way be the uk military involve in this we have just hear that idf soldier have be train on uk soil be this the same idf that have be engage in atrocity include the murder of uk aid worker in gaza the uk of course provide military course for our ally but we always emphasise in all those course the critical importance of international humanitarian law it be important that we work with our ally to meet the amazing standard of our own armed service and be sure the hon gentleman would not want we to depart from that thank my right hon friend for his statement and for make so clear what the uk government action be however it be very clear that the suffering in palestine will continue if not accelerate give the situation pertain in the middle east so what action can be take to try to ensure that aid get into that beleaguered area also what effort can be make to ensure that the recognition of palestine be keep firmly on the diplomatic table my hon friend will know that recognition have certainly be an issue that many colleague around the world have be speak about just in the last few week reassure she that be discuss the aid issue just today with hostage family who be worried of course about the aid available to those who remain under the ground in gaza israel be democracy pluralistic society and an ally in contrast the unhappy and ignoble regime in tehran be theocracy that want to wipe israel from the map that foment terrorism around the globe and that suppress its own people to the extent that even dance be crime be not the good use of british military asset in the eastern mediterranean to try to do something to stop the rain of hypersonic missile and drone on civilian area in israel it be hugely important that we do all we can believe the good way forward be diplomatic because attempt to do this militarily be afraid can not be achieve and think that be widely understand thank the foreign secretary for his statement his reassurance that gaza will not be forget and for have be really quick to come out and ask for de escalation and negotiate settlement nobody want to see nuclear iran not least the people of iran who be pay for this investment by the iranian regime but netanyahu justify the bombing raid by say that iran be close to have bomb and that it could be year or just month away be netanyahu correct call to mind the work of the iaea and refer my hon friend to the resolution of the un security council just last week all of which confirm iran intent and its report june vol correction last week this house be unite in support the long overdue recognition of palestinian state and we urge the minister to advocate for that at the united nations conference in saudi that have now go up in smoke we believe that the us iran nuclear peace negotiation be come close to fruition so do the minister share my concern that netanyahu government may be seek to create further instability in the region to block progression for peace and the recognition of the palestinian state and to distract from the genocide in gaza do not believe that that sit behind the action that we be see at this time do believe that the way forward be de escalation and diplomacy full scale war between israel and iran be clearly in no one interest but neither be nuclear armed iran so what be the government realistic proposal to return to diplomatic solution as soon as possible and to get iran to give up its nuclear weapon programme how realistic be it that iran will engage in such an effort can confirm to my hon friend that along with my colleague in france and germany expect to be engage with iran on this very issue in the come hour the foreign secretary have say and just repeat that no military threat can prevent the iranians from acquire nuclear weapon but surely that be not correct give the danger to we all from iran which the foreign secretary acknowledge in his statement and its continue attempt to increase its ability to enrich uranium will he very clearly agree with that israel be right to strike the nuclear site the phrase that have use about no military endeavour be able to achieve this without diplomacy have be use by the us and by the israelis themselves while deplore the alleged israeli war crime in gaza that should not cloud our view of the iranian regime as british diplomat cover syria see how the iranian regime be directly complicit in the torture and murder of hundred of thousand of syrian civilian be british soldier in iraq in and the british lance corporal brodie gillon be kill by the iranians few month before arrive there have be too many catastrophic british foreign policy decision in the middle east this century so commend the foreign secretary for his commitment to realist and hard headed approach do he agree that the first question for any policy choice should be where do it all end be grateful that the hon gentleman though new to this house bring so much experience agree with his sentiment my constituent greg contact this afternoon he be worried about his year old daughter who be in tel aviv on her own what reassurance can the foreign secretary give to my constituent that we will repatriate british citizen as quickly as possible would first urge the hon member constituent to register his daughter presence to recognise that we be surge staff to the region and that the way out at the moment be through jordan and to reach out to staff the hon member can reach out on the hotline if that be what his constituent so wish may take the foreign secretary back and ask that he clarify the nature of the israeli military personnel training on british soil and whether those involve be participate in operation in gaza if so how do that align with the uk international legal obligation give that israel face proceeding stand accuse of genocide at the international court of justice give that its leadership have arrest warrant issue against it at the international criminal court and give that this government have also move to sanction senior israeli official as say before this be an academic course non combat we have extremely high standard in this country and it be important that we share they although in the instance that he raise this be few than ten people give the uk long stand friendship with israel what assessment have the foreign secretary make of the increase risk to our military personnel in the country in the wide region we be at the high level of force protection at this time because of the ongoing conflict and the danger that exist and it be why we emphasise de escalation and restraint despotic middle eastern dictatorship rogue state terrorist state perilously close to achieve weapon of mass destruction so serious that it could disrupt the entire region hon and right hon member as well as the public listen at home may hear echo of in that description of current event with talk of regime change again in the air what will the foreign secretary do to personally talk back the israeli authority in jerusalem because what they be do at the moment strike as provide the iranian regime with the good possible propaganda tool they could have the hon member be right to emphasise in his word degree of caution he will have hear what say in the house this afternoon which form the bedrock of the diplomacy that our official be exercise in israel in iran and across the wide region support the foreign secretary in his call for de escalation in april last year the raf participate in the shooting down of drone that iran fire at israel will the foreign secretary comment on why the uk act to defend israel from drone attack at that time but do not do so at the weekend each military situation be different there be particular context at that time of ballistic missile come in and particular request we have the asset that could support and we obviously make those assessment as the hon gentleman would expect with our regional ally depend on the circumstance and the context concur with the foreign secretary view that this can only be resolve through diplomacy and that that be the only way we will get resolution know he be learn friend fellow colleague at the bar he will understand international law do he agree that the caroline principle that would allow israel to conduct that strike be not engaged do he not smell rat with the timing of what be happen at this dispatch box speak as foreign secretary not as lapsed member of the bar who qualify in thank the secretary of state for his statement the role of the irgc in life in iran over the year have be human right abuse religious freedom abuse and gender abuse with act of global extremism and terrorism often have their root and support in iran the war in israel be prime example of that anyone who pretend that iran with its nuclear potential be in any way an innocent bystander be be deliberately dishonest will the foreign secretary commit again to work with ally such as the us to minimise bloodshed and ensure that israel be able to remain safe and free from all attack yes will the hon gentleman be right to bring to mind the human right record in iran remind the house that just three year ago iran arrest people execute many and many die all because young woman mahsa amini do not cover herself up she die in prison

and anonymously with professional well resource team and have range of appropriate sanction and mechanism at its disposal the icgs work alongside the independent expert panel which determine appeal and sanction for case that have be bring against member of parliament these arrangement ensure complaint be investigate fairly objectively and to high standard the icgs have be an important driver in establish high standard and improve culture in parliament and we should all support it thank the icgs for its continued work and in particular the contribution of its director thea walton who will be step down from her role later this year last year parliament publish the finding of an independent review into the effectiveness of the icgs conduct by paul kernaghan the review broadly praise the icgs performance with kernaghan be clear the icgs be make difference to standard in parliament and have demonstrate its ability to hold people to account for unacceptable behaviour he say that the icgs be something the parliamentary community should take pride in the review find that the scheme have continue to take positive step to improve timeliness and the quality of its service of course there be always more work to be do it should rightly have the ambition to be the gold standard in workplace grievance scheme in total the review make recommendation of those eight have already be deliver and further eight will be take forward should the motion before the house be agree work on the remain recommendation be under way these be recommendation from an independent review of the independent grievance scheme of this house they really should not be contentious kernaghan first recommendation be to consolidate the various policy and procedure document into one policy document and one procedure document and that the exist icgs assurance group should become permanent icgs assurance board be look through the document and the opposition amendment two of the amendment that they have put forward talk about the size of the icgs assurance board and in particular add two member be it the feeling from the evaluation of the independent process that the board be actually the right size and that we do not need those amendment certainly do not think that we need the amendment the assurance board be make up of representative of both houses the hr department and other appropriate people which be as it should be it also include member of this house who think will be contribute shortly and who be also member of the house of commons commission the make up of the assurance board as propose be right make declaration of interest max in my parliamentary office be one of many trade union rep across this house in fact he be so very good at what he do that hon and right hon member sign an early day motion in the last parliament recognise his service what consideration have be give to representation of the union of house staff and mps staff on the icgs assurance board either as permanent member or in how the board engage with the union in this place put on record my thank to max ken and many other who have do great work represent those who work in this house whether it be for an mp or as house staff the role that the trade union play be absolutely important and their role in this process should be recognise both the house staff and members staff trade union be represent on the icgs stakeholder group and the icgs have an obligation to consult with that stakeholder group before any proposal be bring to the assurance board put on record that hope the icgs continue to do that very closely because the trade union provide an invaluable voice in the operation of the icgs and that should continue the assurance board will scrutinise the day to day performance of the icgs and ensure that investigation be timely and of high quality it will also have responsibility for update the icgs procedure document but only that document thank the leader of the house for bring forward this motion she be absolutely right that no one should have any doubt about the reason for it and no one should have any opposition to it understand that there will not be any opposition to it that be what be tell will she outline very quickly the process for those who have grievance or complaint whether for member or staff so that staff will know all their right it be important that we advertise this service the hon gentleman be absolutely right to do that any member of staff any member of parliament or anybody work in the broad parliamentary community who have be subject to bullying harassment or sexual misconduct should get in touch there be helpline and there be well advertise way of get in touch with the icgs not just to make complaint but to get advice about whether complaint be in scope and can be take forward as say early the icgs have range of mean it do not always involve full investigation with sanction the icgs might often come to some resolution and there be other mean through which any such behaviour could be resolve thank the hon gentleman for raise that point because it be important to be absolutely clear with the house the policy framework of the icgs remain matter for this house that include the definition parameter obligation and key right and permission of the scheme as well as its scope have lay in the library and attach to the motion on the order paper letter from the icgs that set out the difference between policy and procedure because know that be of concern to people colleague may want an update on couple of other recommendation from the kernaghan review that be not matter for the motion today recommendation which ask that political party work more closely with the icgs when deal with complaint through memorandum of understanding be be take forward by the modernisation committee with the co operation of the political party and thank all those concerned for that the house have also take forward recommendation on behaviour training as of the end of march out of new and return mp have attend behaviour training take together the recommendation from the kernaghan review will improve icgs performance and accountability provide great clarity about where complaint should go and how they should be deal with and speed up necessary change to its day to day procedure in total they will improve behaviour and culture in this place this be an important moment for the house to come together hope on cross party basis to show that we stand behind the icgs what it stand for and the work it do and to show that we will improve and take forward the independent recommendation to keep improve its work be disappointed that opposition front benchers have break with year of consensus on this matter to oppose some of the change propose which come from an independent reviewer see that the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope be not in his place despite his amendment be select his amendment which be support by member on the conservative front bench undermine the integrity of the kernaghan review recommendation and can not support they hope the shadow leader of the house will take the opportunity to distance himself from those amendment the reputation of parliament be low with poor trust in politic and politician and it be for all of we to turn the page on that era the safety of those who work on the estate be paramount be clear as be sure everybody be clear that there be no place for bullying harassment or sexual harassment in parliament those who perpetrate it should be accountable and sanction where necessary commend these recommendation to the house and call on all member from all party to support these improvement call the shadow leader of the house will speak to the motion and specifically to the amendment in my name on the order paper as the leader of the house have say successive administrations in collaboration with the house have support across this chamber the development of the independent complaints and grievance scheme it be initiate in under the then conservative government and it have always be develop on collaborative and cross party basis in that context it be surprising disappointing and pity that the government should table motion on the business of the house when it have not be agree in that collaborative and cross party way indeed they be whip their own member that be highly unusual for motion on the business of the house our position have always be that these matter should be work through together through the usual channel and with other senior body of the house in spirit of consensus in that spirit will not press the amendment in my name to vote be very concerned that the amendment table by opposition front benchers would fly in the face of the body independence so be glad to hear that the right hon gentleman will not be push it to vote will he confirm whether his party support an independent process and the icgs if his party be in government would it make change to the scheme or even scrap it be very grateful to the hon lady for the question of course it be conservative body in the first instance develop on cross party basis as far as be aware there be no desire in my party to make it anything other than continuously independent body to suppress and prevent the abuse that occur before it be bring into being abuse with which we be all familiar in many way the icgs have not be without its problem it be in the nature of the house deliberation and the secrecy and privacy associate with these thing that we do not always hear about those problem but broadly speak it have be successful that mean however that in the context of the point of conflict between my side of the house and those on the leader of the house side there be no problem that the motion as draft seek to address and cure let explain in more detail the motion frame the issue as supposedly not one of policy but of procedure as it set out the assurance board have many member it be not simply compose of parliamentarian it include the clerk assistants of both houses members of both houses but on nominated basis rather than elect the parliamentary commissioner for standards lay member of the house of lords conduct committee and member of the human resource team of both houses the proposal before we be that this body should be able to set rule for member of this house without the house itself have any say in the matter so this be not about the nature of the board it be about the question of what say the house have over rule that be be set for everyone affect by the icgs but for member of this house in particular it be nonsense to suggest that lay motion before the house as we have suggest would be difficult or need to involve any delay our position be extremely simple there should be motion before the house to approve or disapprove any decision take by the assurance board such motion can be lay before the house in very short period of time literally in day or two and perhaps even overnight in some circumstance there can be no proper suggestion of delay in the implementation of decision make by the assurance board and therefore no reason at least in my judgment and that of my colleague why this should not be matter for the house to decide it be extremely surprising that the right hon gentleman be take this position give that his party be generally associate with deregulation and remove bureaucracy do he not agree that the proposal he be describe would create additional bureaucracy around an independent organisation no that be not true the motion of this house be not traditionally regard as form of bureaucracy in fact in many way they cut through bureaucracy because they allow we to get to democratically ratify decision very quickly and transparently the trouble come when decision be make without that transparency simplicity and speed of action which be what we be oppose to as have say the present proposal draw distinction between policy and procedure and would mandate the assurance board to act on its own behalf in matter of procedure of course the board contain only one member of the house of commons and as have say that person be nominate rather than elect by the house in other word the assurance board potentially have wide range and coercive power which be to be exercise almost entirely by people who be outside any direct framework of democratic accountability it potentially have the power to overturn decision that be ultimately make by an mp constituent at the ballot box the house have rightly be concerned about the exercise of such power for at least year the motion too draw distinction between policy and procedure of course contrary to the suggestion that have be make procedure include important substantive matter indeed paul kernaghan review set out an illustrative table of potential change which include change whether somebody may be accompany to an icgs interview as have point out this be an issue of power as well as procedure the assurance board have the ability to empower people who be under review by the icgs to bring another person along to an interview or to prevent they from do so in turn this reflect tacit or explicit policy decision about what may be fair or just under the circumstance it be not simply matter of procedure mr kernaghan review also include as an illustration of what he call procedure change the timing of when the parliamentary commissioner for standards be notify of misconduct complaint whether that be before or after an initial assessment of course that too reflect tacit policy judgment about what just process would be such tacit policy judgment show that there be no hard and fast distinction to be draw between policy and procedure and underline that these be not matter for official for unelected people but for member of this house act through this house remind the house that the icgs set rule not merely for member of parliament but for more than passholder and even although this be slightly unclear and in my judgment have not properly be resolve for tourist and visitor to the palace of westminster it be not accountable to any other body today decision to reject amendment course we be not move that amendment so that will be the decision will be one off decision to give up power of scrutiny and it will be hard if not impossible to reverse that once those power be yield this be happen at time when more and more decision be be take by people who be not accountable in any direct genuinely democratic way through the emergence of what people have often think of as kind of bureaucratic or legal sludge that be absolutely deplorable all that we in the conservative party have say be that any decision of this type that be take by people who be not member of parliament should be place before this house in line with its constitutional status and the bill of rights it have always be our procedure in this house not to recognise superior let alone bureaucratic or non democratically elect superior and we should not do so on this occasion should note for the record that be proud to serve on the modernisation committee and in my previous role before come to this place give evidence to paul kernaghan be listen to the right hon gentleman carefully and be struggle slightly to understand his argument point to what might be the late version of the constitution of the conservative party can not be sure about that because unlike the labour party the conservative party do not regularly publish its constitution online be look at version from the section deal with ethic disciplinary investigation and so on say that the govern committee of the conservative party have empower an independent ethic and integrity committee to determine matter of conduct and whether rule have be break the committee be make up of host of independent kc and the chair of the committee this go to the point that he be make because paragraph say that the committee will be the master of its own procedure if that principle be good enough for the conservative party why should it not apply to we in this house do not know in what capacity the hon gentleman give evidence to paul kernaghan but that be an extraordinarily misconceive idea this house be democratically elect chamber and it have be the constitutional doctrine of the united kingdom for hundred of year that it should have no superior that be what we be contest now what may or may not be the case in some other body that the hon gentleman have drag into this conversation in way that rather breach the spirit of this cross party discussion be completely irrelevant be surprised that you have allow that point to be make madam deputy speaker since it be so obviously irrelevant to these discussion that body be not the legislative body democratically elect by the people of this country declare an interest be member of the house of commons commission which have nominate as member of the independent complaint and grievance scheme advisory group so be member of the group that we be discuss when be first elect attend the training on the icgs along with my colleague from the parliamentary intake and be deeply sober by some of the appalling behaviour hear about example of why the icgs have to be bring in be very grateful that the icgs be in place and know that my staff and other member of the parliamentary community be also grateful for this independent process through which people can raise their complaint and grievance fundamentally disagree with the shadow leader of the house the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman in his characterisation of the scheme and disagree with the way that the power of the advisory group have be characterise at no point do the advisory group have chance to make any particular judgment about individual as the leader of the house set out the advisory board govern the procedure that establish how the scheme should operate through its independent investigator without an independent complaint and grievance scheme for this parliamentary community we would be far poor in this day and age when trust and confidence in politician be at an all time low it be vital that we be open to scrutiny and that we attract all possible talent into the parliamentary community that will happen only if people feel safe to work here we must have confidence that an independent scheme be available to everybody who choose to work here so that they can safely do their job hope that everybody support this motion understand that there will not be division and welcome this opportunity to celebrate the positive work do in this area by the leader of the house it be regrettable that all the work she have put into try to encourage cross party support for this measure be not recognise by the shadow leader of the house his characterisation of that discussion be not representative of what actually take place but look forward to there be more support for the motion from other member of this house perhaps from other party who recognise how vital this independent scheme be for the whole parliamentary community call the liberal democrat spokesperson be pleased to support this motion which as the leader of the house say have come about as result of the kernaghan review an independent review of the icgs publish just last year the review recommendation include the creation of an icgs policy framework and the formalisation of the icgs assurance group into an assurance board with responsibility for the creation of and future change to an icgs process document the motion be design to implement those recommendation and be happy to support it the public be understandably feed up with what many perceive as accept poor behaviour from those elect to represent they the icgs be design to help restore trust by ensure that poor behaviour be deal with swiftly and appropriately but that can not happen if mp be constantly mark their own homework if it be think that there be attempt to manipulate the system or to wriggle out of tight spot for political gain we will have no chance of regain the trust that have be erode particularly over recent year that be why be so disappointed to see the amendment that have be table after so many year of trust be erode we need to find way to win that trust back and that be what this scheme do let go through the amendment to explain what mean amendment would among other thing remove the right to make collective complaint make it hard for complainant with the same issue to support each other in come forward it would also prevent the icgs from accept person complaint if it be substantially the same as complaint they have previously withdraw that would worry as do not find it hard to imagine scenario in which complainant be how shall put to withdraw their complaint perhaps follow promise of improved behaviour but then feel the need and have the courage to raise the issue again that amendment would prevent they from be able to come forward again amendment and appear to be rather blatant attempt to stack the membership of the assurance board so that it can be politically manipulated amendment trash the recommendation from the kernaghan review that the icgs assurance board should be able to approve icgs procedure the kernaghan review clearly recommend that the assurance board should be able to create and make change to icgs procedure that be to speed up process that the kernaghan review find to be unduly cumbersome and impact by political consideration be just try to get my head around the amendment be the hon member suggest that we avoid these amendment because we want to ensure that there can not be political influence over the decision be make such that as she say those who have commit these terrible act somehow get away with it indeed thank the hon gentleman for his intervention because completely agree unfortunately what he suggest be what some of these amendment be design to do and that be why can not support they they be an attack on and blatant attempt to manipulate the system and that be totally wrong in short fully support this motion and do not support any of the amendment encourage member from all part of the house to do the same intend to speak briefly and draw the house attention to my role as chair of the parliamentary group for the gmb the union that represent the large number of worker on the parliamentary estate and to my declaration to that effect in the register of members financial interests parliament be on the whole more professional safe and more sober place to work than it once be such progress however be no excuse for complacency inappropriate and predatory behaviour can occur anywhere but the risk factor be high here and pay tribute to all the workplace representative who have work quietly down the year to raise standard and challenge poor practice in this place welcome the step outline in the motion to clarify and strengthen the icgs and also wish to comment briefly on the opposition amendment the shadow leader of the house say that amendment will not be move but we do not hear about amendment which be in the name of back bench mp but be co sign by the shadow deputy chief whip the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey if have understand the amendment correctly it would strike out the scope for collective complaint and it would block the investigation of complaint if police investigation have not result in conviction even though the standard of proof be different for the two thing the amendment would also as far as can tell prevent the reinvestigation of complaint if respondent succeed in persuade or pressurise complainant into withdraw that point be make powerfully by the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman amendment could provide cover for abuse be it agree that be plain and apparent and it be matter of deep regret that it appear to have some degree of sponsorship from the opposition while do not wish to depart today from the recommendation of the kernaghan report will raise some matter on workforce representation we have already hear that the workforce representative in this place will continue to be consult and that be welcome can the leader of the house confirm whether workforce representative will be able to attend meeting of the assurance board in an observer capacity it would also be good to hear whether there will be scope for direct representation of those workforce voice on the assurance board that would improve its functioning know that she recently meet gmb rep to discuss those same concern and hope that she can comment far tonight finally some people provide support to parliamentarian they all deserve to work in modern environment secure in the knowledge that there be robust and independent process provide accountability and redress if they be mistreat the politicisation of those process in recent year be deeply regrettable and hope that cross party support for they can be swiftly restore call the chair of the standards committee may begin by welcome the government motion to put the assurance board on proper footing and to introduce clear policy framework under which the icgs will operate as some colleague have say the icgs be an extremely important parliamentary workplace scheme cover all member of the parliamentary community more than people unusually for body set up only six year ago by former leader of the house andrea leadsom it have undergo number of review which have highlight concern about the operation of the scheme and make recommendation to this house the most recent be the kernaghan review from which today government motion have its genesis the motion will set up in permanent form an assurance board to oversee the working of the icgs welcome the hon member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake on to that new assurance board on permanent footing why be we here today the icgs have experience number of concern process issue since it be set up particularly in respect of the quality of its investigation and the excessive time delay in the processing of those investigation if complainant and respondent be to trust the icgs it be of paramount importance for the assurance board to ensure that the issue encounter with the investigatory process be resolve and that complainant and respondent be subject to process with credible and importantly timely outcome as be sure all member agree it be not acceptable to complainant and respondent that in what be an internal workplace process they must sometimes wait for year for an outcome on for instance bully the committee on standards be specifically prohibit from involvement in individual icgs case preserve the independence of those investigation be vital to the success of the investigation and to the confidence of those who seek the aid of the icgs and those who be investigate under the scheme however the icgs be part of wide standard landscape within the house and the committee on standards have useful voice in highlight how the scheme be operate and in comment on policy in the standard landscape report produce shortly before the last general election our predecessor some of whom remain member of the committee particularly the lay member note that the committee have not have time to consider fully the recommendation of the kernaghan review in paragraph of that report the previous standards committee recommend to the house that the new committee which now chair should continue to consider the analysis and recommendation contain in the review as chair of the committee can inform the house that the committee have since have discussion about the work of the icgs with its outgoing director thea walton thank she for the work that she have do and that it be due to discuss that work far next week owe to the pressure of other work notably the complex inquiry that we have undertake at the request of the modernisation committee and the leader of the house into outside interest and employment we have not have time to consider fully all mr kernaghan recommendation and their implementation but we will continue to make that focus of our work during the current parliament member may have note that the propose new assurance board would contain member of the house of lords conduct committee but not member of the standards committee in the commons dame laura cox in her report on the bullying and harassment of commons staff recommend that process to determine such complaint should be entirely independent of member of parliament and that be the course that the house adopt the house of lords be responsible for its own process and its committee retain great role than this house committee in these matter let emphasise that it be absolutely proper for mp not to be involve in determine complaint but there may be scope for involvement in the policy framework surround complaint have not seek to amend the motion today as have say welcome it but give that involvement in policy do not equate to interference in complaint and nor should it it may be worth revisit in future whether since the lords committee will be represent this house committee on standards ought to be represent as well it might also be worth revisit whether valuable member voice and by member mean not just member of parliament but lay member of the committee beyond the house of commons commission might also be useful do not expect the leader of the house to respond to that suggestion today because it be proper for the committee on standards to consider this matter fully as recommend and as approve by the house once it have have the opportunity to do so it may well revert with further recommendation on how today motion might be enhance as we go forward together on cross party basis seek to ensure that we have the good parliamentary workplace scheme with the appropriate parliamentary stakeholder include in this welcome assurance board let end by acknowledge what some other member have say about trade union only few hour ago unite parliamentary staff branch email all mps about this very point think that the point that have make about the committee on standards sit well with the parliamentary staff branch own view on ensure that all relevant parliamentary stakeholder be include in this welcome assurance board thank all member for participate in the debate and for the spirit in which they have do so particularly thank the chair of the standards committee the hon member for south leicestershire alberto costa for his work and that of his committee in this space and indeed many other space they do huge service to the house in uphold standard and ensure that we be operate under the very good behaviour requirement at all time also join he in thank andrea leadsom who have great deal of respect for for her initial work in set up the icgs the chair of the committee be right to say that there have be concern especially when the scheme be first set up about timeliness about some of the process and about the quality of some of that work as the kernaghan review find that be improve significantly and step have be take but want to make it clear that the motion will accelerate progress in ensure that process be as effective as they can be expect the standards committee to take keen interest in the work involve the icgs as part of its remit and look forward to any further recommendation that it wish to make about the make up of the assurance board or indeed any other aspect of its operation want to make it clear and the shadow leader of the house the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman refer to this that the policy of the icgs remain matter for the house that include the definition of what might be deem bullying harassment or sexual misconduct the parameter and scope of the scheme at all time the obligation on people who make complaint and on for instance witness the right to make collective complaint the right to receive draft assessment report and the right of decision make body to reject report those all remain matter of policy and not procedure in respect of which the house will retain right my right hon friend have say that scope be an issue that the modernisation committee be look at and that it form part of policy rather than procedure can she give an indication of when the outcome of that consideration might be come forward so that the kernaghan recommendation can be take forward far the issue of scope be cover in the kernaghan review kernaghan make it clear that the scope of the icgs in when case involve any two or more member of the parliamentary community perhaps there have be time when that scope have be unintentionally narrow operationally what the modernisation committee be consider be recommendation which relate to memorandum of understanding between the political party and the icgs in relation to how they deal with complaint think we can all agree that when complaint be within the scope of the icgs they should go to the icgs and not to political party which unfortunately have show themselves not able to deal with such complaint in the same way that be not just matter for the modernisation committee it be matter for the political party as well and we be make progress in that regard particularly with the labour party which be keen to engage with the issue will not detain colleague much long but will pick up on few point that have be raise thank my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake for her brilliant contribution and for all the work that she be do on the house of commons commission and the assurance board as ever thank my colleague on the commission and the modernisation committee the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman who make an excellent contribution on why the amendment be gutte amendment which we should not support in response to my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield laurence turner put on record my thank to the trade union rep who operate in this house they should absolutely be involve through the stakeholder group in formal consultation about any change to procedure after this debate will approach the icgs to ask it to consider allow the trade union to attend meeting of the assurance board in the same capacity in which they come to the house of commons commission to make representation because that will be important finally want to take on the argument make by the shadow leader of the house first these be not my proposal they be not government proposal this be motion on the business of the house in my name because that be how such motion get to the floor of the house these proposal be put forward by an independent review to which all political party and all member of this house have the opportunity to contribute of an independent grievance scheme which have rightly improve behaviour and standard they be not my proposal they be independent proposal this body will not be set the rule that be just wrong it will be look at procedure and at how they can be streamline and make more effective as have just say the rule that is the policy will continue to be set by this house it be about time we move on from the age old argument that member of this house have right to behave however they want and the only time they be accountable for that be at the ballot box five year later that be the argument that the shadow leader of the house be propose be sorry but we put that argument to bed long time ago as think the chair of the committee on standards agree if colleague cross party support the icgs and the improvement in behaviour and culture that it have bring to this house and if they want to see that body become more effective and have more timely and quality investigation they really need to support today motion as other have say we all have duty to ensure that this be workplace where people can work safely and securely free from bullying harassment and bad behaviour amendment to have be select for separate decision however understand that no member wish to move they so will move straight to the main question question put and agree to resolve that this house note the report of the house of commons commission entitle independent complaints and grievance scheme policy framework

coldharbour lane from the site of the labour exchange in my constituency member of the windrush generation have help to sustain our nhs from its inception not only in london but right across the country thank my constituency neighbour for make such powerful opening speech do she recognise the valuable contribution of the windrush generation staff at king college hospital in her constituency and equally the valuable contribution and powerful statue of mary seacole at st thomas hospital in my constituency that overlook this parliament of course in our two borough of lambeth and southwark the contribution of the windrush generation be extraordinary it be demonstrate most powerfully in the statue that my hon friend mention the life of windrush passenger and of other from the caribbean

image to their love one harry photo poignantly capture the hope dream and achievement of people in the process of make new life woman in her nurse uniform family dress in their sunday well show off their prized possession and the first image of new baby or new spouse however as we remember those story with affection our commemoration of windrush day must avoid any sentimentality the contribution of the windrush pioneer be make in context of widespread racism the clear and ugly illustration of which be find on sign on the door of boarding house state no irish no black no which in many situation run much deep often result in daily discrimination and humiliation an egregious example be the appalling and still unaddresse scandal of black child be deem emotionally subnormal in the and and be place in special school where they be deny an education and make to feel inferior my hon friend be make very powerful speech she talk about the experience of black child in education and could remind she of my constituent eric huntley whom serendipitously bump into at the weekend he and his wife jessica who live at coldershaw road in west ealing establish the bogle publications bookshop back in the and they also establish the black parents movement which be to help child who be stick in such school and be not be give the education they be entitle to do she agree that we still need to continue that work to make sure that black child in our school be treat fairly and get the education they deserve pay tribute to my hon friend constituent who like so many of the windrush generation demonstrate their resilience by take initiative to circumnavigate the racism to which they be subject we still live with that racism and discrimination today and we can never be complacent about that we must continue to address all the issue that still need to be deal with in the and lot of young black child be identify as educationally subnormal and be send to such school even though they be not educationally subnormal do my hon friend believe that their descendant and the people affect by that really need to be give an apology to acknowledge what they experience during that time thank my hon friend for all the work she be do on this issue as have say believe this be an unaddressed issue on which there be still work to do in that vein it be devastating to read the word of john carpenter which have share before in this house who travel on the windrush age speak in he say they tell you it be the mother country you all welcome you all british when you come here you realise you foreigner and that all there be to it despite the hardship and injustice they endure the windrush passenger and those who follow they settle in the uk and put down root use the pardner hand community saving scheme to buy property to circumvent the racist landlord and to establish business and church sam king become postal worker be elect to southwark council and become the first black mayor of the borough it be very brave achievement since he face threat from the national front which be active in southwark at that time sam be also instrumental in establish the notting hill carnival and the west indian gazette he later establish the windrush foundation with arthur torrington who still run it in my constituency the windrush generation help to forge the brixton we know today in do so they make huge contribution to community where everyone be welcome where difference be not fear but celebrate and where we be not stranger but friend and neighbour to mark the anniversary of the arrival of the empire windrush talented young people from brixton design beautiful logo which be base on the pattern of human dna the windrush generation and subsequent migrant who have come to this country from all over the commonwealth spark the emergence of modern multicultural britain they be part of we and part of the uk century dna the windrush generation make an extraordinary and enduring contribution because the windrush generation continue to endure will my hon friend give way yes on that point about the expat who come over from the caribbean and what they endure do my hon friend agree that we sometimes fail to recognise the strength and the resilience of the windrush generation which often get overlook thank my hon friend for intervene and help make sense of sentence in my note that do not quite work absolutely agree with my hon friend that the windrush generation make an extraordinary and enduring contribution and show immense resilience but they continue to endure racism and injustice in journalist amelia gentleman expose what become know as the windrush scandal the systematic denial of citizenship right to british citizen who have come to the uk from across the commonwealth in the decade after the second world war which see they deport or deny entry to the uk unable to work or claim their pension and refuse healthcare and housing thank my hon friend for make fantastic speech and for secure this debate it do seem sometimes quite unfashionable in this day and age to look at the discrimination that that community have endure for so many decade and not to see it as structural racism in other word there be thread from colonialism empire and slavery all the way through to windrush and what we still experience to this day would she comment on that issue will come on to the wide implication of the scandal which think speak to the issue my hon friend highlight the windrush scandal be the most egregious breach of trust the windrush compensation scheme be poorly set up by the previous government justice have be far too slow and sadly many victim of the scandal have die still wait for redress it be very move to attend with my hon friend and constituency neighbour the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi the windrush national vigil on windrush square on april lead by bishop dr desmond jaddoo to remember the victim comparative analysis by king college london of the compensation scheme compare with other redress scheme include the post office horizon scheme and the infected blood scandal scheme have demonstrate that the windrush compensation scheme have much low success rate for applicant more complex initial eligibility requirement higher require standard of proof an inaccessible application process an absence of funding for independent legal representation for applicant decision making that lack independence and process that be inaccessible it be vital that change be make so that victim of the windrush scandal can have confidence in the compensation scheme that be important because the impact of the scandal be experience not only by the victim themselves but across the windrush generation as whole and for subsequent generation who live with the emotional weight and the economic cost of what their love one have endure and whose trust in british institution and the government have be fractured as consequence my hon friend be make an incredibly powerful speech do she share not just my tribute to amelia gentleman for the work she do to uncover what happen with the windrush scandal as well as people like colin mcfarlane and the justice windrush generation campaign but my horror at the evidence we have see this week that those give compensation to date have not actually be give the same amount as those in other comparable scandal do she agree that we must right that wrong from this place absolutely agree with my hon friend this be question of trust and question of basic fairness there can not be any excuse for lack of clarity across compensation scheme deal with similar structural injustice for which the state be responsible there be more work to do to ensure that such scandal can never happen again this mean reflect on the cause of the windrush scandal in future policy and legislative decision for example we must make sure that the introduction of visas allow no scope for anyone who be legitimately in the uk to be wrongly deny their status because they can not access document online it also mean ensure that we understand our own past the government have commission professor becky francis to undertake the curriculum and assessment review and hope she will be think about how subject such as history and geography can be teach through the prism of an accurate understanding of our past so that through prism of migration to our country whether like people come from town with viking name and norman church or whether their family arrive in the uk in more recent time they can locate their own story in our history and understand that there be no we and they we be nation that have always be form and sustain by people who have come from overseas to make their home on these island and it mean resource properly the organisation that be the custodian of history include the national windrush museum and the black cultural archives in my constituency the bca be establish in by len garrison who have come to the uk from jamaica as child in and become great educationalist in our city the bca have an extensive archive document the history of black people in the uk from the african roman emperor station at hadrian wall septimius severus to black georgians the windrush generation and much much more it be national resource that be critical to our understanding as society and vital for the sense of place and belong for many black british people the bca need stable core funding from the government commensurate with its national role to enable it to do the work of outreach and interpretation and to secure it for the long term mention very briefly the important and ambitious campaign lead by patrick vernon to retrieve the anchor of the empire windrush from its current resting place in the mediterranean sea so that it can be restore as memorial and as tool for the education of young generation in prepare for this debate have be in touch with many people who have campaign and continue to campaign for windrush justice they have differ view about the role of celebration on windrush day know there be some who be concerned that celebration undermine the fight for justice and that they can not celebrate until justice have be do and understand that perspective but there be other who passionately believe that assertively celebrate the windrush generation and all they have contribute and achieve give visibility to the community be part of the fight for justice that celebration sustain their campaigning and it be also important for health and wellbeing be look forward to join the brixton immortals domino club celebration on saturday and the big caribbean lunch on sunday organise by ros griffiths both to be hold on windrush square in my constituency finally want to consider the wide importance of fully address the windrush scandal and all its implication as my hon friend the member for norwich south clive lewis highlight the windrush scandal happen as consequence of structural injustice and it happen as consequence of our history windrush must not be compartmentalised because if we do that we can not be sure that such scandal will not be repeat mention the extraordinary role of member of the windrush generation and their descendant in our nhs which continue to this day our nhs today in king college hospital in my constituency be also sustain by nurse from the philippines and south india who be ask to come by our hospital because we need their skill in our healthcare system we can not rest until we be sure that they or any other group will not face the horrific injustice of discrimination base on racism and ignorance that be embed in law and policy welcome very much the personal commitment of my hon friend the minister to windrush justice be pleased to attend the windrush summit last week at the home office it be credit to the approach my hon friend have take and the work she have do that so many people who have campaign for windrush justice feel able to attend an event in the department that have do they such wrong know that many of the attendee would not have think that possible just few month ago welcome the minister commitment to implement all the recommendation of wendy williams lesson learn review and the imminent appointment of windrush commissioner thank she for all the work she be do to listen engage and take meaningful step to restore trust and confidence know that she understand that there be much more still to do and look forward to continue to work with she on behalf of my constituent to secure the depth and breadth of the change we need thank my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes for secure this important debate she have long be friend to the windrush community and their descendant and have long play major role in celebrate and commemorate their contribution to this country be proud to speak in this debate as the first black mp for liverpool be proud of my african and irish heritage many member might not know that the ss ormonde dock in liverpool the year before the empire windrush make her final destination at tilbury in june the windrush generation come to britain as citizen invite by enoch powell we should remember to rebuild broken nation after the war in liverpool they settle mostly in the south of the city build vibrant community and contribute to our culture in many different way from music to food to football and to the unique scouse spirit they include lord woodbine trinidadian who help the beatles to achieve fame but who sadly be write out of history they work in the shipyard the hospital the bus and the school against the daily struggle and common racism they build our city and claim it as their home today we honour their courage and celebrate the legacy they build in so do we reject again the disgraceful island of stranger narrative that have rear its ugly head recently evoke the shadow of enoch powell as he whip up hatred against the windrush generation and other migrant he invite to this country today be reminder that our diversity be the good of we for the sacrifice these immigrant make to better our country we all owe they debt with that in mind want to use the opportunity of this debate to call for swifter action to fix the windrush compensation scheme the windrush scandal be national disgrace it be deliberate and inevitable outcome of the tories hostile environment policy and nightmare for so many who have come to this country as child citizen who have work their whole life in service to our country and have always pay their taxis the injustice these people still face be deeply feel they be deny access to employment healthcare and other service often become homeless and be even detain and remove from the country they have call home for decade the scandal have have chilling effect on the entire community and many now fear come forward to access service in case they face repercussion to date the scheme have be incredibly slow and bureaucratic datum from this time last year show that claim be make for compensation only of which have receive payment the government have recently make more funding available for grassroots organisation to support claim through the windrush scheme but we still need to go so much far and fast we need to adapt the recommendation make by the williams review rebuild trust and relation with the black caribbean community and consider the implication of our current immigration policy which risk continuation of the hostile environment today we reaffirm our fight against hostile immigration policy and celebrate our diversity as strength congratulate my constituency neighbour and hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes on secure this vital debate the legacy of windrush and the plight of the windrush generation be matter very dear to my hon friend and her constituent as it be to and my constituent not least because her constituency be home to windrush square which sit on the edge of my constituency and to which we both have the pleasure of make numerous visit throughout the year most recently have the pleasure of join my hon friend and neighbour along with our other neighbour and hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi at the windrush national vigil organise by the windrush national organisation this event bring together community member for moment of reflection remembrance and solidarity for the windrush generation and their descendant and provide an opportunity to acknowledge the profound contribution they have make to the fabric of our society it be that aspect want to focus on before come to the windrush scandal and compensation scheme have speak before in this chamber about the role the windrush generation play in not only rebuild our nation but transform our society and culture my constituency of clapham and brixton hill be completely reshape by the windrush generation with legacy that be still evident in the people the culture the music the art the cuisine and in so many other way beyond rebuild our city and enrich our culture the windrush generation play crucial role in shape and sustain the public service that we continue to rely on every single day they be the nurse midwife and doctor who form the backbone of our nhs often work long hour in difficult condition to care for the sick and vulnerable they be the bus driver and train operator who keep our transport network run ensure that britain economy keep go they be the teacher who educate generation of child instill in they the value of hard work and perseverance they serve in our armed force fight for country that do not always recognise they as equal their contribution be not just significant they be indispensable without they britain would not be the country it be today we in this house often speak of the value of tolerance diversity resilience and community what we call british value the windrush generation embody those value through their courage determination and unwavering belief in well future but they be not always treat with those same value in mind their influence run through the fabric of our nation and we must ensure that their contribution be not just remember but celebrate honour and uphold for generation to come we have to celebrate they but we must also understand and remember that the windrush generation be not always treat with the dignity and respect that they deserve and that have to be as much part of our commemoration as anything else those who travel across ocean to come to britain do so think they be come to mother country that would welcome they with open arm instead they be meet with hostility discrimination and barrier to opportunity they be deny housing turn away from job for which they be over qualified and often make to feel unwelcome in the very nation they have come to help rebuild many of they and their descendant face similar treatment during the appalling windrush scandal it be very much scandal of the previous government make the mother of the house my right hon friend the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott recently give lecture in this very building as part of the windrush summit remember the immigration legislation that cause all the problem and lead to the windrush scandal unfold remember the mother of the house stand in this house and warn the home secretary at the time that if the government pass the legislation it would affect people they have not intend it to affect people who look different to number of people across this country she be point to the black community and say that the legislation would be apply in way that would cause this scandal and it do remember when the scandal be bring to the fore remember the news at the time and the people come forward with individual case pay tribute to the mother of the house because it be she who lead the first urgent question on the issue and it be she who continually bring the home secretary and the prime minister to the dispatch box to apologise repeatedly until one of they ultimately pay the price with her job and until certain guarantee be make and we start with the review the previous government take some step towards recompense people for how they have be treat and that be important but for so many include it never feel as though there be genuine remorse for the pain humiliation and torment inflict on the windrush generation it never feel as though the government at the time truly care be pleased that that seem to have change the minister for migration and citizenship be the first government minister to visit windrush square and join we at the vigil in april it do not go unnoticed that this token of respect for the windrush generation be one that no previous government minister have ever display be so pleased that the government have now take step to re establish the home office windrush unit which will focus on the action need to ensure that the windrush scandal be never repeat be also pleased that the home office be recruit windrush commissioner hope the minister can update the house on the progress of that appointment most importantly the minister have stress that the government be commit to fundamental reset for the windrush generation hope that the minister will outline clearly what step the government be take to bring about that reset unfortunately it do not seem from the current immigration legislation go through this house as if lesson have be learn from windrush one thing the mother of the house mention in her recent lecture be that we should be careful not to romanticise the issue of the windrush generation because the scandal continue windrush day be great but justice would be well the windrush monument be great but justice would be even well the funding be give to community organisation it be not much but it be some to push these issue be great but in comparison to the compensation that should be pay it be not enough and again justice would be well while it be nice that the grant and bit of support be go ahead and that we talk about the windrush generation more the home office must not think that that be substitute for the justice that the windrush generation have continually be deny the home office must not think that we do not notice that far too many have die before regularise their status and before receive penny of justice it have not go unnoticed and it must be resolve the windrush generation deserve nothing short of our respect and gratitude for the role they have play in british society hope that the government will begin to lay the groundwork to demonstrate that and not just with pomp and platitude but with the justice that they have be deny for far too long it be an honour to speak in the debate and to mark windrush day it be day of reflection recognition and pride in huddersfield we be proud of our rich diverse community shape in no small part by those who come here as part of the windrush generation and their descendant family make their home in our town and have work in our hospital on our bus and in our textile mill and factory they have help to build not only our local economy but the very fabric of our community and establish number of domino club in the town too they include many people from carriacou in grenada we have one of the large diaspora outside grenada as well as community from jamaica and st lucia their contribution continue to shape the cultural and civic life of huddersfield today windrush day give we chance to honour that legacy but it must also remain call to action especially when so many of those who give so much continue to be deny justice for this year commemoration in huddersfield there will be powerful new documentary series by kirklees local tv as part of its groundbreake windrush wise word project the documentary capture the story of caribbean descendant preserve their live experience for future generation and shin light on the contribution and challenge face by our windrush community and their descendant event like the deighton carnival provide an incredible local celebration of african caribbean culture and continue to showcase the vibrancy pride and legacy of our community in huddersfield venn street be once home to legendary sound system that put huddersfield at the heart of the uk reggae scene in the gregory isaacs jimmy cliff and desmond dekker all play at venn street more often than not artist would come to huddersfield direct from jamaica though some might do one show in birmingham or london it be vital that we celebrate those story but we must also confront the ongoing injustice that many still face previously raise in the house the case of constituent who have be struggle to access the windrush compensation scheme like many he do not have access to support or legal aid the process can be complicated confusing and deeply frustrating for those seek justice sadly his experience be not unique across the country many eligible individual still do not know that they can apply and other be deter by the scheme complexity some be navigate ill health or grief but be expect to work through layer of bureaucracy to get the redress that they be owe welcome the minister response to my question in the chamber and the subsequent assistance offer to my constituent know that she be committed to get this right the labour government have make it clear that the treatment of the windrush generation be profound injustice we must do everything in our power to ensure that everyone affect be treat with dignity and can access the support and compensation they deserve have learn lot about my hon friend constituency from her speech she mention the difficulty that victim of the windrush scandal have have in access support and get the compensation that they deserve in fact many of they have be afraid to go to the authority because it be those same authority that treat they that way in the first place do she welcome the million that the new labour government have put into the advocacy support group which will help small local advocacy group and community group to assist people in access the compensation that they deserve do welcome that be about to turn to the subject funding outreach in place like huddersfield that funding will be important we must ensure that local organisation can play their part because they know good who to reach out to but they must have institutional support we must also embed cultural change in the home office so that these injustice never happen again the windrush generation do not just arrive in britain they help to shape it they make our nhs possible they raise their family in our town and city and they contribute to the growth of our economy they have contribute so much to huddersfield the town live in they have endure discrimination and hardship yet they have stand proud contribute with dignity and determination as we mark windrush day this year let we move beyond word let we match our tribute with action and ensure that justice be deliver not delay pay tribute to my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes for her powerful introduction to the debate she reference area of her constituency that know like the back of my hand because they be where grow up grow up in brixton there be thing that recognise from an early age recognise that the place be special and unique recognise that in the midst of all the chaos it seem to work well recognise that it embrace so many people from so many different community think about people with my heritage from nigeria mix and interact with the irish portuguese west indian spanish latin american and white community all those different community be mix in the melting pot that we know and love as brixton it be really important and such testament to see windrush square unveil in the heart of brixton it be place that give so many people sense of belong and somewhere to commemorate and celebrate our vital windrush community sunday windrush day be another chance for we to celebrate and recognise the contribution of the windrush generation to our community and to the whole of our country as my hon friend the member for huddersfield harpreet uppal just say last year have the honour of welcome the now prime minister and foreign secretary to the windrush celebration in oval in my constituency not too far from here at that event my hon friend the members for dulwich and west norwood and for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro other constituency neighbour and meet the pioneer of the windrush generation who have build the community that grow up in around brixton these community give we the strength and resilience to face challenge and belief that we could make change when we work together windrush day be source of pride in the community that have be build through that hard work and determination as much as windrush day be celebration we must not lose sight of the challenge that this generation have go through too often these community have be build in the hard fire of adversity and nothing represent that more than the windrush scandal it see many member of the windrush generation people who have be in this country for decade be deny the most basic right this lead to people lose their home and their job and even be deny medical treatment can you imagine the scandal some of they must have know that their grandmother or grandfather have work in those same hospital at least people end up be wrongly deport from this country that they call home disgracefully as we have hear many of those who be victim of the scandal be still wait to receive compensation the independent report last year that at least people have die wait for compensation follow this windrush debate the government must work to speed up the compensation scheme as know my hon friend the minister be do they must reach out to people who understandably do not feel comfortable engage with the government and the home office urge the government to ensure that the windrush victim have the right legal support so that they feel able to get the money that they deserve the windrush scandal do not have its root in the it start in the discrimination and racism that the windrush generation experience when they first arrive in the uk it start when some of they arrive by train at waterloo station in my constituency the station be home to the national windrush monument which be unveil on june by prince william and catherine the statue depict man woman and young child with their suitcase in their sunday good that be what the windrush generation do they dress up in their sunday good to come to this country to help serve it the statue be design by basil watson urge member who have not visit it to do so on the side of the statue there be poem by professor laura serrant entitle you call and we come relive that call to action the call to duty that many of the windrush generation rightly answer want to mention the mary seacole statue think back to early june when be pace up and down the maternity ward of st thomas hospital try to get my son to come out he be almost two week overdue look down from the eighth floor and see that statue of mary seacole think about the many woman from the windrush generation who have commit so many hard year to work for our nhs through the year mary seacole appeal member of the community raise vital fund to ensure that the statue be erect it be formally open by another great pioneer and child of the windrush baroness floella benjamin who sit in the other place another statue in my constituency be the bronze woman at stockwell war memorial just by the roundabout accord to record it be the first statute depict black woman it be erect in and have the honour of attend the unveiling as councillor it depict woman hold child in the air it show the power of the windrush which run through my constituency and many other as hon member have highlight we can not again make the same mistake that happen during the windrush scandal while we have make progress we know that racism have not completely disappear from our society we need to ask ourselves how it can be right that we still see health and race inequality in our nhs and how it can be right that some of our black and minority ethnic community continue to live in bad quality accommodation we must not treat the windrush scandal in isolation and we must not as government make the same decision in our policymaking that lead to the windrush scandal in the first place urge the government to be extremely careful when they carry out their review of citizenship later this year we must not put arbitrary barrier in the way of those arrive in our country we must not say to people who work day in day out as our nurse and our carer job that essentially keep this country go that they have less of right to become citizen do that will entrench further inequality in our country it will deny people who pay taxis and help run our public service say in how those service be run that can not be the aim of this government and we must never introduce hostile policy like those that lead to the windrush scandal in the first place thank my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes for open this timely debate she make fantastic speech and hon friend for their contribution want to touch on the story that windrush tell of this country story be important the story we tell ourselves define we as country it be right that we celebrate the windrush generation and their contribution but as other speaker have say there be dark side to this story do not want to be too negative but want to touch on some of that dark side because it be important and instructive give where we find ourselves as country and world would not be stand here today as black member of parliament if one of my ancestor in africa have not be abduct and put on slave ship for generation after that my ancestor be beat and make to work in the most terrible condition to make money for someone in this country or for their slave master in the caribbean yet because of those ancestor stand here today history be complicated think we can agree on that but that do not mean that we should not try to unpick it look around at my colleague must say that it be politically fashionable in some quarter to say that many of we be recipient of dei diversity equality and inclusion policy that we have be gift our place and that anyone who come from the black community be woman or have tendency or sexuality that be not see as the norm have be gift their position anyone who understand the labour party selection process will know that be not the case in fact many of we face double whammy we be both work class and black it take lot to get into this place and yet we be here and we be not go anywhere remember back in when the conservatives who be here on the government benches under boris johnson produce the disgraceful race report think they want to forget that would be interested to hear what the shadow minister the hon member for gordon and buchan harriet cross think about that report now it say that structural racism do not exist it be figment of our collective imagination we have effectively be dream about it for year and there be no link between empire slavery and the racism that stretch from that all the way to the windrush scandal and beyond indeed that notion of outsider of foreigner figure in much of our immigration debate to this very day what be racism it be hierarchy of worth we see it all around the world in conflict if you be from this part of the world with this ethnicity your worth be this much but if that be your ethnicity your worth be that much and you can take that much suffering and if you up here you do need to suffer you part of the elite that be what racism be hierarchy of suffering we can not forget that it be real and allow people to tell we that our history be something in which only good thing happen where thing be shiny and nice and that we have an empire to help and develop the rest of the world remember when be go on the itv breakfast programme and have to have chat with the producer beforehand he say clive you do realise that the railway in india have help india to get into the century and to industrialise the british build those railway reply you know you right but that be why it so complicated do you think for second that the british build the railway in india for the benefit of the indians the answer be no they build they to extract vast wealth from india and it just so happen that the indians can now use that railway network to industrialise and make themselves rich history be complicated will finish with this there be movement around the world in germany in europe and dare say it in the united states whose president believe that genocide be happen in south africa really he believe that and he be come here for state visit all around the world there be an attack on history on good history good history be complicated it tell complicated story about this country and its past have serve this country know full well its history in empire know full well its history in slavery have serve it because love this country wart and all do not need to tell myself story about this country be perfect in the past and only do thing for the good love it wart and all because it have give and my family friend and community so many opportunity my dad be welcome to this country by my mother english family the trade union movement welcome he our history be complex the labour party be complex the country be complex history be complex let we never forget that as we go forwards we must understand that history be complex for reason because and this move we be all human being and human being be complex themselves that be why our history be complex and that be what we need to understand as we move forward talk about windrush celebrate windrush day and pass legislation in this place about black people about immigration and about asylum seeker let we remember our complex history and try to do well in the future it be always pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for norwich south clive lewis history be write by the person hold the pen that do not necessarily mean that it be the history of what happen at the time it be tell through specific lens thank my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes for instigate this important debate on windrush my brent east constituency be one of the most diverse constituency in europe on that point as this be the first time have speak in the chamber today send my condolence to everyone affect by the plane crash in india as many of my constituent have be ultimately what affect one affect we all the windrush ship bring people from jamaica trinidad st lucia grenada and barbados as my hon friend the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy say many serve in the british armed force in world war two so they be owe something by their mother country will talk bit about my mum my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi talk about people come over in their sunday good if we look at those picture we can see how crisp and sharp their suit be with shirt that be sparkle white they be proud so proud we have our play out clothe our school clothe and our church clothe and never the three do meet we be teach an inherent sense of pride in ourselves we be not allow to eat on the street because that would give the impression that we do not have food at home we be not allow to carry clothe in plastic bag because they call that scandal bag in jamaica so we have to have proper cloth bag we be teach so much we wash every day which might seem like weird thing to say now but my parent would tell that they have only wash once week because they have to go to wash house we have to wash every single day we also wash our meat and our chicken before we season it and the seasoning be more than salt and pepper salt and pepper be an accompaniment what be bring from the caribbean be more than some people appreciate because it be now take for grant when we go to other west indian people home we would find lot of thing in common like hand crochet doily on the chair and on the table my mum use to crochet little duck and dip they in dye so they have little red beak it be so inventive nowadays we would pay fortune for that skill all our clothe be bespoke would be embarrassed that my mum make my clothe but now would love my mum to make my clothe to measure now have grow up realise that the thing that we be teach to be almost ashamed of when we come here be actually very special very unique and grand the reason we would find the same picture frame in west indian people home be that there be only one photographer who would take picture of black people and frame they picture of wedding kind of look the same then because there be only one place that would do that for the west indian community that be how west indian people be treat in place that they call the motherland the windrush scandal be about not just the loss of employment the loss of access to benefit homelessness and the loss of access to housing or the loss of access to healthcare and education as my hon friend the member for liverpool riverside kim johnson say the system be deliberately structure to make sure that black people do not progress by label they as educationally subnormal to stop their ability to work and earn it stop people buy their house or send their child to college which lot of west indian people have do the reason only people have claim be that there be lot of shame that come with that the west indian community be very proud community that be why we have to instil labour value from labour government in how we readdress what have happen to the windrush generation it have be an absolute scandal around plus people have be affect by this issue and some will die some have die and some will die before they see justice we must speed up progress the scheme be not light touch design as the then government say it be it be something like page and although they say that people do not need lawyer they do because it be so complex be ashamed that not one back bench member of his majesty opposition have come to this debate this be not niche debate this be debate about hundred of thousand of people who come to this country to rebuild it who be invite here and opposition members have not even have the decency to come here and contribute and they be the cause of the scandal and injustice will end as begin martin luther king say that what affect one affect we all because that be the interrelated structure of society we be all intertwine in life journey and as racism be increase in some part of the country and people be try to divide we hope that we remember on jo cox day that we have more in common thank my hon friend for their speech and story from their constituent they have be incredibly insightful as well as heartbreaking but that be exactly why we be here be sincerely grateful to my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes for give we the opportunity to bring the house together to honour the windrush generation and those whose courage resilience and extraordinary contribution help rebuild post war britain let we be clear they answer call they work hard and graft and they help to shape the very fabric of the country we know today we see example of that generation legacy in wolverhampton embody in the life and work of so many people like professor mel chevannes an inspirational role model who when elect in as the city first african caribbean councillor go on to chair the social service committee and later become the first african caribbean chair of the royal wolverhampton nhs trust her leadership her service and her example not only open door but shattered glass ceiling this weekend wolverhampton will pay lasting tribute to professor chevannes with the unveiling of bronze bust permanent reminder of the power of representation and the endure contribution of the windrush generation to our public life today be not only about celebration it be also about justice because for too many the windrush story include real pain the windrush scandal inflict deep harm on people who have every right to live here people who build their life here and serve our community but be betray by system that refuse to see their humanity we see that pain in the story of the late paulette wilson wolverhampton resident and cook who once work in parliament in this very house paulette come to britain as child and spend more than year here but in she receive letter declare she an illegal immigrant she be make homeless her benefit be stop and in she be detain and send to heathrow for deportation to country she have not see in half century with the swift action of my predecessor my hon friend the member for wycombe emma reynolds who be paulette mp at that time work alongside the refugee and migrant centre in wolverhampton and with paulette strong determination she fight back and she win she be grant leave to remain but more than that she choose to speak out become voice for so many other who have suffer in silence her courage help expose the systematic injustice at the heart of the windrush scandal and force change in plaque be proudly place at the wolverhampton heritage centre once the office where enoch powell write his divisive river of blood speech but now thriving symbol of african caribbean heritage and real community spirit welcome the fact that this labour government be forge ahead to deliver justice launch million advocacy fund re establish the windrush unit significantly reduce the time take to allocate claim and begin the recruitment of windrush commissioner to ensure victim voice remain at the heart of government policy windrush should not just be chapter in our history it have to be call for action to challenge we to build country ground in fairness shape by justice and define by true sense of belong for all commend the courage and resilience of paulette and all our windrush generation the thousand of other who face this rogue injustice and hope that such atrocity can never happen again call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party there have be some incredibly powerful speech this evening and feel really lucky to be participate in the debate there be lot to celebrate but there be an awful lot to be really angry about as well we owe an enormous amount to the caribbean and broad black british community for their contribution to our society not least the windrush generation key role in build the nhs and in my own region the black caribbean community role in profoundly shape greater manchester cultural landscape and social fabric in louise da cocodia become manchester first senior nursing officer have come from jamaica in confront with relentless racism in her role she channel her experience into activism become key anti racist campaigner and her legacy

simone today the chuck gallery in central manchester continue that legacy by showcase and celebrate afro caribbean and african art it work to foster great understanding and appreciation of caribbean artistic perspective here in the uk far too many people life be still blight by prejudice discrimination and inequality racism be still far too prevalent in our society we all have responsibility to recognise that reality but also to recognise the role that we can play in challenge that injustice be proud that the lib dems be commit to fight for racial equality and that mean unequivocally condemn racism in all its form and tackle injustice wherever we see it in her opening very powerful remark the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes rightly lay out that the previous government fail to deliver the justice that windrush victim so deeply deserve the government dither and delay on implement the recommendation of wendy williams lesson learn review liberal democrats will keep push the government the windrush generation make huge contribution to the life and the economy of the uk but want to pay tribute to the hong kong community in my constituency of wokingham and across the united kingdom who be sure will make the same contribution to the uk be deeply concerned that the government be pile uncertainty and worry on british hongkongers through their reform to indefinite leave to remain these people who be live here in britain already fear retribution from china do my hon friend agree that the government should have their back and maintain the five year pathway for british national overseas status holder be very grateful to my hon friend for raise the huge contribution of hongkongers in his constituency have ask the minister before about some of the change the government propose to the time period for indefinite leave to remain the minister have answer that consultation be under way and be sure that she will talk about that in her closing remark feel that we need to value the contribution make by those who be new arrival in our country and agree with my hon friend comment the liberal democrats will keep push the government to right the wrong force on to the windrush generation include by urgently implement the lesson learn review in full and make the compensation scheme independent of the home office like the hon member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy hope very much that the minister be in position to update the house on the progress be make on right those wrong and deliver justice the lib dems have long push for the implementation of comprehensive race equality strategy which would include provision aim at reduce the disproportionately high and utterly shameful maternal mortality rate for black woman and for eliminate racial disparity in maternal health as other right hon and hon member have mention this evening want to have point on the record as it be very important to do so be talk to the parliamentary private secretary beforehand and talk to the minister early on on behalf of windrush people who get their status in northern ireland will say that the windrush scheme for northern ireland enable people to work and remain and to have equality with the rest of we put on record our thank for that scheme because those in northern ireland who come through the windrush scheme be enable to help our country and northern ireland be well place because of the culture history and interaction and social action that they bring be grateful to the hon gentleman for his comment each successive generation that arrive on these shore as people have do for millennia have add to our rich cultural and social fabric he be absolutely right to highlight his part of the world and the impact that people have have in his community on the thing that we should also look at will say that we should end the disproportionate use of stop and search we should also look very carefully at the use of live facial recognition which be most likely to wrongly identify black man and woman in so many way we be hold this debate because of the tireless campaign of many of the windrush generation not least the liberal democrat peer my noble friend baroness floella benjamin floella journey be emblematic of the windrush generation she arrive in britain from trinidad in at the age of accompany by three of her sibling her childhood be mark by persistent racism she recall every day as battle where she be either ignore or subject to verbal abuse during house viewing neighbour call the police accuse her family of steal furniture from what would soon be their own home floella of course be not alone many child of her generation endure those indignity in silence shoulder the burden of rejection by cling to the hope that life would one day improve leave school at she charter an extraordinary path first as an actress then as presenter writer independent producer and always tireless advocate for the care education and welfare of child worldwide today she chair the windrush commemoration committee which be charge with establish lasting tribute to the windrush generation and its descendant among the committee notable achievement be the unveiling of the national windrush monument at waterloo station which be design by celebrate jamaican artist basil watson as mention early by the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi the monument stand as powerful symbol of the immense hardship and equally immense contribution of the windrush generation to british life floella voice remain powerful one hold the government to account to ensure that the windrush generation receive the recognition and justice that it so rightly deserve believe it be floella who first propose the idea of windrush day as national celebration of the moment when caribbean community come to rebuild britain in the face of adversity it be thank to her determination that we be able to mark this occasion and speak of it today as well as be the giver of the good hug in parliament she be celebrated author use her experience to educate future generation with her writing it be right that we

and west norwood helen hayes for bring the debate before the house give member chance to speak about their and their constituent experience of and with the windrush generation as note by the then prime minister clement attlee in letter to mps those first arrival on the windrush be expect to make genuine contribution to address the uk post war labour shortage the story of the windrush generation that follow be both troubling and inspirational with many account of exceptional resilience and the overcoming of adversity want to be very clear it be important that we acknowledge when the state fail its citizen the treatment of some windrush citizen be an unacceptable failure that successive government must own that be why the previous conservative government apologise unreservedly and take decisive action it be critical that the last government establish the compensation scheme over million be grant in compensation to those affect with over million have be pay out and that figure continue to rise as more claim be settle under this government do the shadow minister believe that the windrush scandal be an aberration few bad apple over few decade or be the cause structural racism think that windrush and other scandal that have plague our society be stain on the uk whether the cause be as the hon member say few bad apple or any other reason the fact remain that we have to take action to address the issue that be create we must ensure that those who be affect be compensate that those who be affect and can not be compensate be recognise and that measure be put in place so that it can not happen again that be what be interested in be not here in the last parliament that be not an excuse but all can do be my very good to ensure that injustice be not repeat in future as be say the compensation scheme have pay over million and that figure continue to rise we hope the government will continue to ensure that those settlement be pay however as we look forward to this year windrush day while we must reflect on and learn from past injustice we should also reflect on and honour the contribution of this remarkable generation the noble baroness lady benjamin who chair the windrush commemoration committee speak in parliamentary debate about the importance of celebrate the positive aspect of windrush day while for some that name will forever be associate with scandal welcome the effort of community and member of the windrush generation to reclaim it in positive light many campaigner want the term windrush to represent not the scandal but the vast and very many contribution make to the uk by this generation as his majesty the king note when meet member of the community on the anniversary of the ship arrival this be an indomitable generation he say history be thankfully and finally begin to accord rightful place to those man and woman of the windrush generation critical element of that recognition be commemoration and as we have hear we should be grateful for the work of basil watson whose magnificent national windrush monument stand as powerful tribute to the community as the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi reflect its location at waterloo mean that thousand of people pass it every day constant reminder to those depart or arrive at the station when the decision be make to locate that monument at waterloo official say that the decision be take because it be where thousand of windrush pioneer first arrive in london before start new life across the uk for many member of the windrush generation waterloo be not the end of journey but the beginning of new life in this country and of the many contribution that they would go on to make former minister at the ministry of housing communities and local government capture the essence of the monument basil watson sculpture perfectly capture the spirit of windrush in it we see the strength hope and expectation of those who arrive with little and yet give so much of course that statue while symbolic be only one part of the broad support provide as member will recall in the previous government launch fund to support community lead initiative celebrate windrush day that funding be intend to enable project across england to commemorate the windrush generation and their descendant it form part of wide effort to recognise the windrush generation last contribution to british society and be pleased to see that the funding continue in with project support under the current grant scheme understand that the government have dedicate million in funding towards honour the windrush legacy in addition while the government have vital role to play the anniversary also see wide range of private contribution from event and exhibition to documentary article and much more it should also be recognise that drama and tv have way of enrich the windrush story think of probably my favourite programme it be perhaps the hon lady favourite the midwife which show the drama of the windrush scheme through the people in that programme what they endure and what they have give to society do she recognise that drama and tv also can tell the story of windrush in great way thank the hon member for that television drama and even radio and other non visual mean can show the story in lot well light than anyone make contribution at this dispatch box or in this chamber see these thing in real life in colour and out in the street be the way to bring they to life and to make sure that we recognise every day how the community be completely entwine in our society the anniversary in few year time will be another opportunity to commemorate the endure impact of this generation and to encourage further work from those in the creative industry who play such vital role in shape the public consciousness although today have be choose as an appropriate moment to hold this debate in advance of windrush day on june commemoration need not be limit to anniversary or milestone be confident that those involve will continue to highlight and educate other about the vital role that individual play their resilience and their ability to overcome adversity more broadly today allow we to reflect on the windrush generation contribution to our institution industry and importantly our community it be worth remember that hmt empire windrush be transport dozen of caribbean passenger who have serve as raf airmen many return from leave and other rejoin the service many more from this generation and their descendant would go on to serve our country in our armed force that be in addition to the countless individual of the windrush generation who help build and sustain the nhs particularly when post war uk have an acute workforce shortage that be not to mention the enormous contribution across so many other field include science education social work business and countless other acknowledge the government ongoing work to address the injustice that occur in the home office there be still claim to be resolve and payment to be make and challenge remain in overcome the consequence of past error we can not change the past but we can ensure that the scheme establish by the previous government continue to deliver for every eligible person welcome the fact that patrick vernon and baroness benjamin and other campaign for windrush day it have give we all the opportunity to focus on the story of those who come to this country and contribute so much share how they come to britain how they be shape by it and how they have help shape it in turn that be vital as such thank member for share their experience and those of their constituent in the debate call the minister start by thank my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes for secure this debate and all member who have speak in an incredibly powerful and move discussion that include my hon friend the members for ealing southall deirdre costigan for liverpool riverside kim johnson for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy for huddersfield harpreet uppal for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi for norwich south clive lewis and for brent east dawn butler also thank the shadow spokespeople who make powerful contribution will try to refer later in my speech to number of the point that have be raise but let first thank my hon friend the member for wolverhampton north east mrs brackenridge for her story about professor chevannes and paulette wilson which like so many story tell during the debate be very powerful also want to acknowledge basil watson wonderful sculpture and the story that it tell to all who come and go through waterloo station when my hon friend the member for brent east speak about her mother think we all recognise little bit of her mother in all our mother and be sure that her pride in her mother would have be reflect very much in her mother pride in she and her contribution this sunday mark year since the empire windrush arrive at tilbury along with the thousand of other who come to the united kingdom from the caribbean and country across the commonwealth in the and they become know as the windrush generation they and their child and grandchild have enrich our society in myriad way and we owe they an enormous debt of gratitude on windrush day we celebrate they and their extraordinary achievement and contribution to our economy community society and culture but we also acknowledge the appalling and humiliating treatment to which many member of the windrush generation be subject owe to the action of past government let say clearly and without equivocation that the home office windrush scandal be travesty that cause untold pain and suffering there have be much talk about right the wrong but word alone be not enough and this government be back up our promise with action we promise reset when we be in opposition and since the general election we have seek to strengthen engagement with victim their family community and stakeholder organisation have regularly meet many organisation include the windrush national organisation pay tribute to bishop desmond jadoo and be honour to join very powerful vigil with some of my hon friend in april and windrush defenders legal from london to manchester and from cardiff to edinburgh have hear victim describe how their life be turn upside down about the trauma they go through and about the impact that the scandal be still have on their life as we have seek to embed culture of listen and learning throughout the department we have work to improve training and standard as well as publish the report the historical root of the windrush scandal last september be clear about the fact that the lesson we learn should inform our way of work across government in april the home secretary and be honour to host the windrush cymru elders for special screening in the home office with professor uzo iwobi and race council cymru of the bafta nominate film windrush cymru last week we be proud to host the first day of the national windrush museum annual summit lead by dr les johnson and denize ledeatte powerful summit address the theme of reframe windrush and justice for new britain we will very soon announce the appointment of new independent windrush commissioner underline this government unwavere determination to ensure that the voice of the windrush generation be hear their experience be acknowledge and proper compensation be deliver we be committed to improve the windrush compensation scheme to ensure that those to whom compensation be due receive the support that they deserve quickly in opposition we frequently hear that the application process be too complicated with insufficient support for those wish to make claim the government be determined to ensure that the victim of the home office windrush scandal be hear that justice be speed up and that the compensation scheme be run efficiently and effectively we have already make change to the casework process reduce wait time for the allocation of claim from four month to under six week in april we launch million advocacy support fund to provide dedicated help from trusted community organisation when victim apply for compensation however we recognise that there be much more to be do which be why ministers be continue to engage with community group on improvement to the compensation scheme and we will ask the windrush commissioner to recommend any further change that they believe be require want to address two point that be make in the debate the first be about people who unfortunately pass away after submit claim we be aware of about claimant in these very difficult circumstance the team continue to work closely with their appoint representative who be usually member of the family to ensure that claim continue and be conclude as quickly as possible we prioritise those claim where we be notify that individual be suffer from critical or life limit illness and official be review the current exclusion in the rule on compensation for private and occupational pension we be work at pace to consider option for how we can compensate for these loss and work closely with the government actuary department to support this critical work the windrush story have resonance for we all and for community across the country be pleased to tell the house that this government have support this year commemoration through the windrush day grant scheme which be chair by paulette simpson and work with my noble friend in the other place the minister for faith and communities we be fund project to celebrate and commemorate the windrush and to educate people about it we be fund the national windrush museum to collect and preserve precious asset for future generation and as great educational resource for school researcher and the wide public my hon friend the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy talk about the government give little bit of money for this and that be really pleased to hear about the windrush museum will the minister consider set up an emancipation educational trust so that we can have building where we can talk not only about the injustice of windrush but about the injustice of people be enslave thank my hon friend for her comment and be very happy to talk about these issue far she will know that the migration museum document history through some very powerful exhibition it be so important that windrush day event be happen across the country with community festival live music workshop talk film and so much more and be look forward to mark windrush day this weekend both with the caribbean african health network in manchester and at the big caribbean lunch in brixton where hope to join my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes in windrush square pay tribute to the work of ros griffiths and the friend of windrush square base in my hon friend constituency in this debate and those in recent year we have hear the powerful and vivid account of people experience since the include on the anniversary on which his majesty the king describe those who step off the empire windrush at tilbury in as pioneer which be exactly what they be through their hard work sacrifice togetherness and unbreakable spirit they endure against backdrop of racism and discrimination that we know exist at the time but more than that they thrive on the railway road and construction site in our armed force factory and fledgling nhs and in so many other sector they help britain get back on its foot they help rebuild this country its infrastructure and our public service however windrush be not merely prosaic story of service render at time of national need it be so much more than that it be story of community that become indelibly etch into the very fabric of our social tapestry and story of art music literature language and cultural enrichment put simply it be the story of british life be change for the well to wrap up again thank all member who have speak also pay tribute to those who have be mention in the debate include baroness benjamin and my right hon friend the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott who in this house and the other have arguably do more than any other to advance the windrush cause and highlight its importance to our national identity this debate have be powerful and poignant reminder of the countless way that this country have be strengthen by the windrush generation and their descendant and the enormous debt of gratitude that we owe they their contribution span every facet of our society put simply britain would not be britain without they and under this government they will always get the respect thank and support that they deserve thank all hon member who have contribute to the debate we have hear from many different area of our country from yorkshire merseyside manchester east anglia and the west midland and we have of course have great representation from north and especially south london we have have powerful contribution pay tribute reflect thoughtfully on the complexity of our history and speak about the injustice that the windrush generation have endure although this have be very consensual debate it be disappointing that there be so little recognition from the shadow minister the hon member for gordon and buchan harriet cross of the fault of the windrush compensation scheme for many of my constituent engage with the scheme have truly be nightmare because the threshold of proof be so high and the process so complicated thank the minister again for her commitment to engage with windrush campaigner and to put right the wrong of the past finally wish everyone who be celebrate this weekend joyful and meaningful celebration that acknowledge and celebrate the windrush generation give strength to our community and create friendship acceptance and togetherness make less space for racism and injustice my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler mention our dear friend jo cox who be murder by right wing racist nine year ago today and whose voice we still miss in this place end with jo word we have far more in common than that which divide we official report june vol if we can live out that truth we can continue to make the progress that our community need to see question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider windrush day business without debate scottish affairs order that stephen flynn be discharge from the scottish affairs committee and dave doogan be elmore on behalf of the committee of selection animal experiment medical research motion make and question propose that this house do now kitchen before start must declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on phase out animal experiment in medical research this issue be very important to and to many of my constituent who contact about this matter recognise that there be many view on this topic on both side of this debate but it be clear that the scientific evidence for end these procedure become strong by the day be also member of the labour animal welfare society and must also declare that interest many people may not be aware that five animal be use in research every minute of every day in the uk non technical summary of animal experiment licence grant between january and march show that over million animal be approve for use across project include beagle and there be further licence for invasive brain surgery on monkey many specie be use include dog cat rat horse mouse zebra fish and chicken many may be surprise by that list but the simple message be that animal experiment be fail patient and will say bit more about that later recently lead petition debate in westminster hall on immediately ban the use of dog in scientific and regulatory procedure this petition now have over signature which think be great demonstration of public opinion on this issue during that debate quote from debate in the other place in on the protection of dogs bill in which it be state that experiment on dog might be discontinue yet century later we be still here debate this issue recently meet researcher at glasgow university who be work to develop animal free research method they tell that one challenge they face be lack of dedicated funding do my hon friend agree that if we be to transition to more humane testing the government must consider make more research funding available agree with my hon friend move towards animal free research will take some time which be why we refer to phase out the funding structure particularly relate to academic research have to shift thank she for her intervention commend the hon lady for secure this debate and for lead the petitions committee debate in westminster hall this afternoon speak to she beforehand do she recognise that there have be world lead innovation in anti tumour necrosis factor treatment for arthritis and that have have life change impact across the world on those with auto immune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis crohn and colitis that would not have be possible without limited research on animal research on animal must be consider as an option give that people with those disease now at least have the opportunity for well life due to the medication perfect because of it as say this be about phase out animal experiment in research hope that the example of scientific experimentation the hon gentleman have give would be possible without animal research in year to come the use of animal in research raise serious question about animal welfare particularly in procedure that cause pain distress or even death do my hon friend agree that advance in technology be make the transition away from animal testing more feasible in vitro technique use human cell and tissue computer modelling and organ on chip technology provide promise human relevant alternative these method can offer fast more cost effective and more ethically sound result than traditional animal test fully agree with everything my hon friend say it be important to note that only of the uk public feel it be acceptable to use dog for medical research with that in mind ban the use of dog in medical research could be our first step towards fully phase out research on animal we should be encourage to follow in the footstep of other country such as the usa which have recently publish road map with the aim of make animal test the exception rather than the norm for pre clinical safety toxicity testing over the next three to five year my hon friend mention the usa commit to road map believe the eu have also do so and be look to phase out animal testing entirely through its road map which be due to be publish in do she agree that the uk government could commit to something similar road map that give activist and other confidence in our direction of travel fully agree with my hon friend congratulate my hon friend on secure the debate like she be member of the labour animal welfare society will she pay tribute to the work of animal free research uk which have do lot of work on this issue and the campaign on herbie law which be propose framework that would set deadline of for phase out animal experiment in medical research in the uk and ensure support for scientist make the transition thank my hon friend for his intervention and fully agree with everything he have say will speak about those matter bit later to achieve those aim we must consider several thing there need to be serious shift in funding towards non animal method the all party parliamentary group on human relevant science estimate that human relevant non animal method funding represent between and of total biomedical research funding in the uk and of the total public expenditure on that need to shift considerably the cosmetic brand lush be one of the group work to fill this funding gap with prize fund that support initiative to end or replace animal testing recent winner range from organ on chip technology that emulate the human liver development in in silico model to predict cellular process at molecular level and research group improve multi material bioprinting platform for create human organ on chip model these non animal method can be far more relevant and accurate to human body compare with testing on other specie give the success of the cosmetic industry phase out this proven approach could be replicate and provide legislative blueprint for the next step in the medical sector in march complete marketing ban on all endpoint for animal testing on cosmetic be introduce on the day of the ban introduction in the european commission confirm that between and total of million be invest in research into alternative to animal testing in the eu reflect major investment envisage for use well beyond the cosmetic industry do my hon friend agree that funding for computer modelling and artificial intelligence opportunity be vital for this sector especially as we look to reduce cruelty in animal testing could not agree more with my hon friend it be worth question the quality of care for animal use in animal experiment answer to write parliamentary question indicate that only one licence application have be reject over the past seven year indicate that licence to conduct animal experiment be rarely refuse applicant be also allow to adjust and resubmit licence application to enable they to be grant for the past four year application have mean number of iteration before they be grant accord to animal free research group that support scientist to transition from animal base to human specific medical research and provide expertise in this area animal be involve in breach of animal use licence condition in breach include non compliance adverse welfare outcome failure to provide adequate care and failure to provide food and water in some case for up to six day an estimated of drug fail in human clinical trial even though they have pass pre clinical test include animal test we already know that our body be very different to those of other specie and that animal be not reliable testing method simple example be the number of food that be poisonous to animal but not to human such as chocolate which be poisonous to dog one example of that failure be the case of sepsis condition that kill people in the uk every year researcher rely on test on mouse yet hundred of drug that have pass test on mouse have go on to fail in human trial demonstrate the unsurprising fact that sepsis in human be different to sepsis in mouse researcher from stanford and harvard have show that the genetic response to inflammation in mouse be profoundly different from those in human so why do we continue to undertake this horrific testing could describe the process of induce sepsis in mouse have actually write it out for this debate but it be extremely distressing and many would find it very upsetting suggest that any member interested in find out what define severe animal experiment should look it up it be indeed truly horrific many other disease model have history of poor translatability in human such as sepsis as we have just hear or type diabete which could be prime candidate for phase in more human relevant model an example from many year ago be thalidomide which be test and test on mouse and cause no problem whatsoever however when take by pregnant woman many baby be bear without limb and with other problem when that drug be test on mouse it have no impact whatsoever on the baby mouse when they be bear to use diabete as an example rodent differ from human on every tier of glucose regulation yet they be still use in experiment rather than relevant human base method the labour manifesto commit the government to partner with scientist industry and civil society to phase out animal in medical testing science be motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now kitchen science be show we that non animal method be effective more relevant and more accurate to the human body innovative technology know as new approach methodology can effectively and safely replace animal experiment to achieve this there be critical need for robust timetable to be introduce look forward to hear the minister update on the road map that will get we there thank my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell for open this important debate and thank all hon member for their contribution we appreciate that the use of animal in medical research stir the strong emotional instinct of many people across the uk include many colleague here the day when we can finally bring an end to animal testing can not come soon enough sadly however that day be not here yet phase out animal testing have to be do in lockstep with the development of safe accurate and validate alternative the reality be that the technology be not yet advanced enough for alternative method to completely replace the use of animal consequently the carefully regulate use of animal remain necessary to protect human and the wide environment animal testing continue to be require by international agreement which all global medicine regulator follow include the uk medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency such testing be regulate through the animals scientific procedures act know as aspa the act specify that animal can only be use in science for specific limited purpose where there be no alternative where the number of animal use be the minimum need to achieve the scientific benefit and where the potential harm to the animal be limit to the absolute minimum this be know as the three replacement reduction and refinement the system also include three tier system of licensing that license each establishment project and individual involve in perform regulated procedure involve animal new technology include ai as refer to by colleague do offer potentially revolutionary way to create alternative technology that be why our manifesto commit we to partner with scientist industry and civil society as we work towards the phasing out of animal testing as the first step we will publish strategy later this year lay out how the government will support the development validation and uptake of alternative method and official be work on this as we speak the strategy will set out how we will create research and innovation system that replace animal with alternative method wherever possible and that place the uk at the forefront of international effort to drive this agenda be proud to say that the uk be already world lead in the development of alternative method and we be keen to utilise this technology as much as possible do the minister know whether there will be timeline for that strategy be there likely to be date and milestone that we be work towards or just generic description of the direction of travel the road map will set out how we can get to place where we can phase out animal testing can not set out date and what the road map will include but huge amount of investment be go into many of the project that have be mention hopefully that will all be include in the road map as colleague have say where other nation be develop new way to phase out animal testing we will look into those and see where we can replicate they we be closely follow development in europe and the us and we work closely with both the food and drug administration and our european colleague on this matter currently the government support the development and dissemination of the three through uk research and innovation that be primarily achieve through funding of the which work nationally and internationally to drive the uptake of alternative technology and to ensure that advance be reflect in policy practice and regulation on animal testing since its launch in it have commit over million through its research innovation and early career award to provide new three approach for scientist in academia and industry to use that be only part of our support many ukri programme include research on organoid cell behaviour and ai may eventually lead to the development of non animal testing method but they be not categorise as such because they be basic research at the moment the government have also provide more than million of funding for seven centre of excellence for regulatory science and innovation to help drive advancement in healthcare the in silico cersi lead by the university of manchester aim to support the use of computational technique to test and develop medical product to be clear we want to replace the use of animal in scientific procedure with alternative where we can but for now the carefully regulate use of animal in scientific research remain necessary if we be to protect human and the wide environment thank hon member once again for their insightful contribution to the debate look forward to we work together go forward question put and agree to house adjourn
