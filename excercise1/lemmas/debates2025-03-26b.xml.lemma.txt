local trust waiting list in my hon friend area be down and he be do great job for his community we have already deliver million extra appointment that we promise because of the record investment in the budget the conservatives can not have it both way if they welcome nhs investment they can not criticise raise the money to pay for it call the leader of the opposition in minute we will hear the chancellor emergency budget even the home secretary husband call it an emergency budget as she scramble to fix the mess she make last october but first let we turn to another government minister who be make mess of her brief the education member ah why do labour mps vote against ban phone in school last week because it be completely unnecessary have teenage child almost every school ban phone in school they do it already we need to concentrate on what be really important here which be get to the content that child should not be access would genuinely like to work across the house on that because there be huge amount of work to do but the battle be not with school already ban phone the battle an important emerge battle be to work together to ensure that the content that child be access wherever they be be suitable for their age we can look at the content but if the ban be unnecessary why have the government start review just last week the education secretary describe ban as gimmick yet teacher and headteacher say that the evidence already show that school that ban phone get well result the prime minister be wrong not all school do this only one in school be smartphone free will he turn on this we need to ensure that all school do this but the vast majority do it be really important that we focus on the battle we need to have with mobile phone which be the content that child be able to access we need to ensure that that content be control wherever they be it be question of have the right battle on the right issue not waste time on this when almost all school be already ban mobile phone be surprised that the prime minister would say that his own government evidence say that phone disrupt nearly half of gcse class every single day discipline be the no issue in many school under the conservatives school become twice as likely to be good or outstanding after go through our behaviour programme so why do the education secretary abolish that programme the right hon lady talk about the record of the last government under their watch third of child start school without appropriate level development such as not be able to use knife and fork quarter leave primary school without the require standard of reading writing and math and one in five child be regularly absent that be why we be push up standard with more information from ofsted transparency for parent and more intervention where school need it the prime minister be not answer the question about discipline in school because he do not care about discipline in school everything he do be ideological and his decision be cost school so much the national insurance hike mean that every state school in the country have to pay more for teacher the education secretary promise to compensate school in full for the job tax why have it not happen it be labour that introduce academy and push up standard this be not ideological be parent of two teenage child both of whom go to state school so be invest in this and it matter hugely to there be nothing ideological about it that be why we be drive up standard as we always have do the prime minister do not answer the question about compensate school for the job tax which be cost school lot of money the ceo of the united learning group say that the grant that they be give be short some school will face shortfall of up to can he guarantee that no teacher will lose their job as result of his job tax it be this government who put record amount into our school at the budget just as we put record amount into our nhs and public service which be utterly fail under the last government yet again the right hon lady want all the benefit the nhs but she can not say how she be go to pay for it that be what get we into the mess in the first place the whole house will have hear that the prime minister could not guarantee that teacher job be safe not only be he tax school but he be lower standard he talk about our record so will tell he what our record be under the conservatives english school shoot up the international league table while standard fall at school in labour run wales academy freedom lead to the big improvement of standard in generation but the education secretary be attack they with her reform can the prime minister point to any evidence at all that these discredit academy reform will improve school standard yes take the example of school go into academy the vast majority of school be already academy therefore we need to think again about what we do about fail school that be already academy we need to go on to the next chapter the conservatives never take the big decision that be why we end up with their record open border which the right hon lady be cheerleader for crashed economy mortgage through the roof the nhs on its knee and hollow out armed force what have we get already under this government two million extra nhs appointment breakfast club include one in her constituency record number of people who should not be here be return and fully fund increase in defence spending that be the difference labour government make recently visit harlow college and see the work it be do train the bricklayer and electrician of the future do the prime minister agree that the work of further education college like harlow be vital for the house building that we need for future generation what will his government do to support harlow next generation my hon friend be great champion for his constituent we be invest million in training up to more skilled house builder to support the next generation and deliver million new home we be create technical excellence college and investing in stansted airport create job nearby which will create more opportunity for young people in harlow call the leader of the liberal democrats the british drama adolescence have shine much need spotlight on the enormous damage be do by social medium to the mind of many of our young people especially teenage boy we have argue that social medium giant should be much more toughly regulated and pay more tax so that we can defend our young people from this harm we have have disturbing report that the government be consider scrap the digital service tax and water down britain online safety legislation to appease president trump and his co president elon musk will the prime minister categorically rule out both those thing and make it clear that he will guarantee that british law on tax and social medium will be write in this house and not the white house yes of course as the right hon gentleman well know online safety be important and important new measure be come in the next few month under the act we need to see whether we can go far on this issue because there be concern about whether the measure go far enough but will the law be make in this place of course they will be grateful for the prime minister reply on the social media law but he do not answer the point on the digital service tax we will come back to that move on after president trump national security adviser accidentally add journalist to group chat that be discuss military action in yemen and give all the concern that we share about president trump relationship with vladimir putin and jd vance insult disdain for britain and our armed force will the prime minister order an urgent review into the security of the intelligence that we share with the united states we work with the united states on daily basis think that the right hon gentleman would like to think of himself as reasonable and when he be not jump in windermere quite serious but unpick our relation with the us on defence and security be neither responsible nor serious medina from lyminge in my constituency be register blind she recently tell how she have be fail by the break social security system leave behind by the conservatives she face great difficulty get support from access to work which be essential across my constituency and be not help to find pay employment it be so important that disabled people who want to work be support to do so what be the prime minister message to medina and other like she who have be abandon and shut out of employment for far too long every person should have the right to work and we will always protect the most severely disabled and those with lifelong health condition we need to support medina and the other like she who can and want to work that be why we be invest billion in personalised and tailor employment programme and introduce the right to try work guarantee the conservative party preside over fail system that do not help they and then blame they we will never do that those who know well know that do not talk of this often but for half of my adult life be physically disabled when first walk through the door of this chamber do so with crutch on my right arm to support my body weight know how it feel right now in scotland some of child live in poverty have disabled person in their household can the prime minister explain to actually no can he explain to those child how the labour party make mum and dad poorer will lift they out of poverty be grateful to the right hon member for share his personal experience of this he be right to do so my family have live with disability for many year as well so understand the human element we need to give support to those who need it we need to help those who want to work into work and we need to be clear that those who can work should work in england we inherit fail system that could not be defend but it be also fail in scotland the right hon member focus on young people and young scot that be of they be not in employment education or training that be terrible almost scot be economically inactive due to temporary or long term illness what we be do be take the step to help people into work with billion of employment support the scottish government have record funding under the budget what be they go to do to help the young scot who be be fail by their government the wrexham and flintshire investment zone be one of the flagship example of how when the government talk about kick start economic growth they mean it this million plan will breathe new life into the local economy and create good local job mean that young people in wrexham will be able to find more opportunity on their doorstep will the prime minister join in welcome this important development for north wales and the potential that it will unlock it be really important that we unleash the economic potential of north wales include by kick start the investment zone which be back by major business like airbus and jcb to leverage billion of private investment invest million to benefit aerospace worker at broughton where meet the fantastic young worker and secure billion of investment in shotton mill secure job on deeside we put record amount of money into the welsh government at the budget decision that be oppose by plaid shale gas wells for what reason the government have order that the uk two shale gas well be permanently seal the right hon member ask about shale gas there be very real economic and environmental consequence to fracke and community have clearly say no be sorry but that answer have nothing to do with my question which be to ask why the government be order the permanent sealing of britain only two shale gas well the government be perfectly entitle on environmental ground not to exploit such well in normal condition but do the prime minister not recognise that take decision now to concrete these thing over so that future government can not use they in desperate situation such as an international conflict where other source of power be cut off from we be an extremely irresponsible and reckless thing to do the right hon member know that there be real consequence of fracke as have set out what we need to do to secure our independence and the next generation of job and to low bill be move at speed to renewable energy that be why be pleased that record investment be come into renewable energy so that tyrant like putin can not put his boot on our throat if the conservative party do not want to support that investment they should say so engagement will the prime minister join in thank colleague from across the house and the excellent clerks and staff who have spend the last few month work on the terminally ill adult end of life bill committee do he agree that if the law be to change on assist dying it be extremely important to implement that change as soon as it be safe and practicable to do so congratulate all colleague work on the bill and take part in the debate it be an important issue on which there be different view across the house and within party the bill be matter for the house but it be the government role to ensure that every piece of legislation that pass through parliament be effective and workable so we will continue to work with my hon friend as the bill promoter to do that in the same way that we do for every private member bill that pass second reading if parliament choose to pass the bill the government will implement it in way that be safe and practicable acorns child hospice provide compassionate care to very young cancer patient and their family across bromsgrove and the village yet it face staggering increase in national insurance contribution as result of choice make by this government with no exemption for hospice and no uplift in non capital funding this mean that the charity will have to draw on charitable donation make by the public which will affect frontline service this be not right so will the prime minister take this opportunity to right that wrong and exempt hospice from this tax we be invest million in adult and child hospice to improve facility equipment and accommodation as well as million in funding through the child hospice grant interruption conservative members cry and moaning would have lot more value if they start their question with an apology for crash the economy in the first place road in burton and uttoxeter and across staffordshire be litter with pothole local people be fork out thousand because of the conservatives neglect and incompetence despite this labour government give tory staffordshire county council million to get the job do do the prime minister agree that the people of staffordshire deserve well than road with more dimple than staffordshire oatcake my hon friend be right pothole be real nuisance if somebody be use their car or van for work and they hit pothole they be look at

billion invest across the country on top of that every council must now publish how many pothole it have fill so that we can show that we be make progress and deliver something that do not happen under the last government when he be director of public prosecutions do not think the right hon and learn gentleman would have sit comfortably in the cabinet of prime minister cameron but incredibly in scotland we have situation in which the head of prosecution the lord advocate do sit in cabinet this situation have be throw into sharp focus lately by police probe into the finance of the snp and have be throw far into focus because although not personally involved the lord advocate ultimately sit at the head of the investigation into former first minister nicola sturgeon who face potential criminal charge this situation have be create by the snp who will not fix it do it sit with this house to amend the situation this be really important issue and labour in scotland have be clear that it would separate that role that be the right thing to do for the reason that have just be articulate it be the obvious thing to do and obviously it be what we do in england and wales there have be call for review of this issue since but the snp have not act fast on those call it really do need to bring forward proposal now to deal with this problem which have be sit there for very long time join the prime minister in welcome the delegation from bring kids back which be try to return the ten of thousand of child abduct by vladimir putin in an act of pure evil the prime minister will be

full spending review in june will then return to the house in the autumn to deliver budget in line with our commitment to deliver just one major fiscal event year let now turn to the obr forecast want to thank richard hughes and his team for their dedicated work the increase global uncertainty have have two consequence first on our public finance and secondly on our economy will take each in turn in the autumn set out our new fiscal rule that would guide this government these fiscal rule be non negotiable they be the embodiment of this government unwavering commitment to bring stability to our economy and to ensure security for work people because the british people have see what happen when government borrow beyond their mean the mini budget deliver by the conservatives result in high bill high rent and high mortgage and it be not the wealthy who suffer most when they crash the economy it be ordinary work people they continue to feel the effect two and half year later of the damage that the conservatives do let be clear there be nothing progressive there be nothing labour about work people pay the price for economic irresponsibility the british people put their trust in this labour government because they know that we they know that would never take risk with the public finance and would never do anything to put household finance in danger we must earn that trust every single day set out two rule at the budget the first be our stability rule which ensure that public spending be under control balance the current budget by so that day to day spending be meet by tax receipt the second be our investment rule to drive growth in the economy ensure that net financial debt fall by the end of the forecast period while enable we to invest alongside business turn first to the stability rule the obr forecast show that before the step that will take in this statement the current budget would have be in deficit by billion in have be project to be in surplus by billion in the autumn as the uk alongside our international peer like france and germany have see the cost of borrow rise during this period of heighten uncertainty in global market as result of the step that be take today can confirm that have restore in full our headroom against the stability rule move from deficit of billion in and billion in to surplus of billion in billion in and billion in that compare with the headroom leave by the previous government of just billion that mean that we be continue to meet the stability rule two year early build resilience to shock in this more uncertain world the obr forecast that the investment rule would also be meet two year early with net financial debt of of gdp in and in before fall to in to in and then to in provide headroom of billion in the final year of the forecast broadly unchanged from the autumn forecast after the last government double the national after they double the national debt debt interest payment now stand at billion this year that be more than we allocate to defence the home office and the ministry of justice combine that be the legacy of the conservative party the responsible choice be to reduce our level of debt and borrowing in the year ahead so that we can spend more on the priority of work people and that be exactly what this government will do say that our fiscal rule be non negotiable and mean it will always deliver economic stability and will always put work people first say it at the election say it at the budget and say it again today let now set out the step that the government have take at the budget we protect work people by keep our promise not to raise their rate of national insurance income tax or vat at the same time we begin to rebuild our public service after the conservatives leave billion black hole in our public finance our be the right choice the right choice for stability and the right choice for renewal fund by the decision that we take on tax as promise in the autumn this statement do not contain any further tax increase but when work people be pay their taxis while still struggle with the cost of living it can not be right that other be still evade what they rightly owe in tax in the budget deliver the most ambitious package of measure we have ever see to cut down on tax evasion raise billion per year by the end of the forecast today go far continue our investment in cut edge technology invest in hmrc capacity to crack down on tax avoidance and set out plan to increase the number of tax fraudster charge every year by these change raise furth billion take the total revenue raise from reduce tax evasion under this labour government to billion these figure be verify by the office for budget responsibility and to thank my hon friend the exchequer secretary for his continued work in this area last week my right hon friend the secretary of state for work and pensions set out this government plan to reform the welfare system the labour party be the party of work we believe that if you can work you should work but if you can not work you should be properly support this government inherit broken system more than people every day be qualify for personal independence payment one in eight young people be not in employment education or training if we do nothing we be write off an entire generation that can not be right and we will not stand for it it be waste of their potential and it be waste of their future and we will change it as my right hon friend say in her statement last week the final costing will be subject to the obr assessment today the obr have say that it estimate that the package will save billion in the welfare budget reflect its judgment on behavioural effect and wide factor this also reflect final adjustment to the overall package consistent with the secretary of state statement last week and the government pathway to work green paper the universal credit standard allowance will increase from per week in to per week by while the universal credit health element will be cut for new claimant by around and then freeze on top of that we be invest billion to provide guarantee personalised employment support to help people back into work and million to support the department for work and pensions and our jobcentre to deliver these change effectively and fairly take total saving from the package to billion while spend on disability and sickness benefit will continue to rise these plan mean that welfare spending as share of gdp will fall between and the end of the forecast period which be very different from what we inherit from the conservative party we be reform our welfare system make it more sustainable protect the most vulnerable and most importantly support more people back into secure work and lift they out of poverty at the budget fix the foundation of our economy to deliver on the promise of change that work have already begin there be some million extra appointment in our nhs waiting

fully protect can also confirm our approach to capital investment in the autumn budget announce billion of additional capital spending to crowd in investment from the private sector in order to fix our crumble infrastructure and create job in every corner of our country today be not cut capital spending as the conservative party do time and again because that choke off growth and leave our school roof literally crumble that be the wrong choice it be the irresponsible choice it be the tory choice today be instead increase capital spending by an average of billion per year compare with in the autumn to drive growth in our economy and to deliver in full our vital commitment on defence this government will ensure that every pound we spend will deliver for the british people by increase productivity drive growth in our economy and improve our frontline public service let turn to the impact of increase uncertainty on our economy to deliver economic stability we must work closely with

britain future today can confirm to the house that the obr have upgrade its growth forecast next year and every single year thereafter with gdp growth of in in in and in by the end of the forecast our economy will be large compare with the obr forecast at the time of the budget that be the difference that this labour government be make this be not just about line on graph it be about improve people

that real household disposable income will now grow this year at almost twice the rate expect in the autumn compare with the forecast in the final budget deliver by the conservatives and after take inflation into account the obr say today that household will be on average more than year well off under this labour government that will mean more money in the pocket of work people and high living standard promise by this labour government deliver by this labour government and oppose by the party opposite the world be change we can see that and we can feel it change world demand government who be on the side of work people act in their interest act in the national interest not retreat from challenge and not step back it demand government with the courage to step up to secure britain future and to seize the opportunity that be out there and before we be impatient for change the british people be impatient for change after year of failure and we be begin to see change happen our plan for

britain building will drive growth in our economy and put more money in people pocket there be no quick fix but we have take the right choice return stability to our economy after year of mismanagement by the party opposite and deliver security for our country and security for work people that be what drive this government that be what drive as chancellor and that be what drive the choice have set out today commend this statement to the house call the shadow chancellor at the last budget the right hon lady say that she would bring stability to the public finance but this statement more appropriately refer to as an emergency budget have bring she to order rightly want to hear the chancellor and now want to hear the shadow chancellor interruption do not need any help this emergency budget have bring the right hon lady to cold hard reckoning she have become fond recently of talk about the world have change and indeed it have this country be grow at the fast rate in the only about year ago just as the oecd the bank of england and other forecaster include we learn today the obr have state growth have be halve for this year it have be cut in two as consequence of the decision and the choice that the right hon lady have make on her watch inflation be down to on target under conservative government on the very day of the last general election we be now tell that this year we will be run at twice the level as be forecast under we in that will mean price bear down on household and on business right across the country because of her choice the obr also say that unemployment will be rise this year next year and the year after in fact across the forecast period it will not decline at all so much for the right hon lady back to work plan we have already see what it mean when it come to control borrowing under this chancellor she have come forward now with plan to squeeze spending later on in the forecast period and she have of course tell the obr that these be the element of spending restraint to which she will stick but what do the market think give her track record and the fact that she have fail to control spending and borrowing to date what do the right hon lady think the market will make of her late promise of course the right hon lady say that none of this be her fault it be the war in ukraine it be president trump it be tariff it be president putin it be the conservatives it be her legacy it be anyone but she what the british people know however be that this be consequence of her choice she be the architect of her own misfortune it be the right hon lady who talk down the economy so that business survey and confidence crash through the floor it be the right hon lady who confect the billion black hole smokescreen that be only ever there to cover up for the fact that she and the prime minister renege on their promise to the british people during the last general election and black hole that the office for budget responsibility itself ironically at the government behest have say it will not legitimise she choose to be reckless with sliver of headroom against her fiddled target she borrow and spend and tax as if it be the little wonder that the chancellor have tank the economy little wonder that we have an emergency budget all because of her choice the chancellor like to tour the television studio and tell everyone that they should be thankful that she will not be ramp up taxis in this emergency budget as she do before but that will be cold comfort to the million up and down the country who be wait in fear and trepidation for the start of the new tax year buckle under the burden of tax that will rise to the high tax burden on her watch in the history of our country may ask the right hon lady whether when she reply she will give that much need reassurance particularly to business that she will not be ramp up taxis still far in the autumn even basic economist know that if you tax something you get less of it you do not need to have work at the bank of england for year to know that so what do the chancellor tax she tax job and wealth creation she have destroy livelihood business have be clobber big and small small company the backbone of our economy and enterprise have be crush on the altar of her ineptitude the chartered institute of personnel and development have tell we that third of the business affect will shed labour with morrison lose job tesco and sainsbury no wonder the federation of small businesses have say that outside the pandemic business confidence have be leave at its low level on record however it be not just business it be charity it be gps it be pharmacy it be those who transport child with special educational need and it be hospice care for the sick and the dying in this house the labour party have the opportunity yesterday and last week to stop that but they vote our amendment down and we will never let their constituent forget it if you ramp up taxis mr speaker and if you ramp up borrowing and spending without any commensurate improvement in productivity it lead to grow inflation and inflation have be increase on this government watch it mean that interest rate stay high for long the chancellor have just trumpet the fact that there have be three interest rate cut since the labour party come to office she know full well that there would have be more than that have she she know full well that interest rate be high for long because of the choice that she make this have lead to servicing cost for our national debt run at twice the defence budget and today we have learn from the obr that debt interest be to increase still far and none of this money will be spend on public service it will be go down the drain the real black hole be not the one that the chancellor invent it be the one that the chancellor create be not the central problem that this chancellor be gambler even with her fiddled fiscal target she leave way too little headroom be not the truth that while the right hon lady say of the last budget that it be once in parliament reset she roll the dice on wafer thin margin and she lose reckless with her finger cross she fiddle the target and she miss they interruption order be not sure about the language be use think there be well and more constructive word that the shadow chancellor would prefer to use in future may just point out that all the chancellor fiscal headroom disappear not just some of it in fact she go underwater to the tune of billion reel from one fiscal event to the next be not way to run the public finance and break your fiscal rule to the extent that the right hon lady have in just six month be public humiliation may now focus briefly on defence spending we on this side of the house welcome the fact that the government will reach of gdp by as we press they to do and we note the step stone along the way that the right hon lady have just announce but we should go far than that the target should be bring forward to this parliament so may ask the right hon lady give the geopolitical tension that she have raise what provision she have make in her headroom in her fiscal plan for increase defence spending more quickly in this parliament if that prove necessary may also ask she this would she scrap the absurd chagos deal and put that money behind our armed force the economy be in perilous state but there be different way there be different choice on tax and spending and borrowing and on productivity and on welfare let just say few word about welfare it be the privilege of my life to serve as the secretary of state for work and pensions and when it come to welfare reform with that privilege come deep responsibility the responsibility for welfare reform to be properly think through with very clear know that labour member do not like it because it be an alien idea to their party so that we could be fair to the taxpayer but equally fair to the many people up and down the country some of whom be highly vulnerable that be an approach on our watch that lead to million of saving across the forecast period and few people go on to long term sickness and disability benefit as direct consequence we would have go far much far and we set out clear plan in our manifesto to do exactly that but those in the party opposite rush their change they have no plan there be not single mention of the personal independence payment in the labour party manifesto and when they get into office the labour government pussyfoot around and dither why because it be deeply divisive within their rank and file then suddenly when the chancellor decide that she have run out of money out go the word to find some saving in welfare to scrabble around to yank every lever possible then there be the spectacle frankly of what the obr have say about the simply shambolic change that be announce only last week by the secretary of state for work and pensions we have go from incompetence to chaos there have be more change to this policy than there be at the last minute to the right hon lady linkedin profile the result be the bad of all world wholly inadequate level of saving on welfare with welfare cost spiral ever higher and change that be likely to harm many vulnerable people may ask the right hon lady when the secretary of state for work and pensions come to the house last week with these change she do not provide an impact assessment but be this because the obr have not sign off the number be it because the department do not have enough time to produce one or be it only provide today as many of we suspect because this be think to be good time to bury bad news the forecast for growth be down the forecast for borrowing cost and inflation be up and business confidence have be smash into million piece this chancellor be constantly try to blame force beyond her control the right response be not to duck responsibility but to build resilient economy the right hon lady would have we believe that that be what she be do but how can we believe this chancellor how can we trust this chancellor she be the chancellor who say she would not increase borrowing but she do she say she would not change her fiscal rule but she do she say she would not put up national insurance but she do she say she would not cut the winter fuel payment but she do she say she would not tax farmer but she do and she say she would not move to more than one fiscal event year and she just have now we be all pay the price of her broken promise today number confirm it we be poor and we be weak to govern be to choose and this chancellor have make all the wrong choice know that the shadow chancellor have not be in his role for very long but at least he be not misquote shakespeare today if this be budget it would be the leader of the opposition respond be glad that she be still in her place but know she will want to get back to her office for lunchtime steak soon the right hon gentleman talk about budgets let remind the conservative party that the only emergency budget we have see in recent year be in response to their party disastrous mini budget mini budget that crash the economy send mortgage bill spiral and leave billion black hole in our nation finance conservative members may have forget about the damage that they do to our country but the british people never will as always the shadow chancellor talk lot but he do not offer single alternative he say he oppose our tax rise but he can not tell we whether he would cut the nhs to reverse they he say he want economic growth but conservative members abstain on the very planning reform that the obr have say will kick start growth mr speaker you do not change the country by abstain or by sit on the fence you change the country by lead and by take action and that be what this government be do the shadow chancellor say he want business to trade but he do not want we to talk to the second large economy in the world or indeed our big trading partner in the european union he simply be not serious four month into the job and he have get no clue the right hon gentleman want to talk about growth but he do not say anything about the fact that the obr have upgrade growth next year and every single year after he talk about pensioner but he forget that it be his party policy to scrap the triple lock which we be protect and which will mean the state pension rise next month by over he talk about wage but he forget the fact that we be boost wage by boost the national living wage from next month the shadow chancellor say nothing about living standard or this morning fall in inflation because the last parliament be the bad on record and the obr have today revise up its forecast for family finance work people be always well off with labour the right hon gentleman be learn something because at least this time he have ask couple of question so let respond to they he ask what the market should make of this what the market should see be that when have be test with deterioration in the headroom we have restore that headroom in full that be one of the choice that make he say that it be sliver of headroom well it be more headroom than inherit from the conservative party when be leave with sliver of headroom rebuilt it after the last government erode it that be the difference that we have make while they leave the public finance and the public service in mess we wipe the slate clean which mean that we have the flexibility now to increase defence spending as the leader of the labour party have do the conservatives have year to increase defence spending and now they lately come to the party the shadow chancellor mention welfare reform and his time at the department for work and pensions what legacy one in eight young people not in education employment or training and people day go on to personal independence payment the obr say today that welfare spending as share of gdp will now start fall far cry from what we have under the conservative party the shadow chancellor speak about employment the obr say that employment will increase that wage will increase and that living standard will increase what change after year of the conservative party the world be change and no one can be in any doubt about it but the conservative party be stick in the past divide out of touch and carping from the sideline conservative members have no plan no plan to kick start growth no plan to fix our public service and no plan to keep our country safe the only plan for change they be work on be plan to change their party leader and we can not blame they for that if the opposition have no plan let remind they about ours the minimum wage up real wage up house building up nhs investment up investment in our school up investment in our road up defence spending up and every single one of those policy be oppose by the party opposite they be oppose by the conservatives oppose by reform oppose by the snp oppose by the liberal democrats and oppose by the greens it be the anti growth coalition in action they be the blocker we be the builder secure britain future protect work people and deliver change call the chair of the treasury committee my right hon friend inherit very difficult challenge when she become chancellor of the exchequer last july and she be absolutely right that the book need to balance this be not other people money we be spend but taxpayer money our constituent hard earn money and she be right to be tough as chancellor we look forward to quiz she at the treasury committee next week and be sure she be look forward to it just as much the chancellor announce an extra billion year in capital spending and she talk about extra defence spending could she give some more detail about where she hop that extra billion year will go thank my hon friend for that question and do indeed look forward to attend the treasury committee next week be pleased to serve on the treasury committee in the past and it be pleasure to give evidence to it we will set out in the spending review my right hon friend the chief secretary will set out in the spending review the allocation of the additional capital money however be able to announce today the billion for defence from next year as well as the billion as downpayment to build the affordable and social housing that we need those be two example of the priority of this government to get britain building and to secure our national security call the liberal democrat spokesperson the people of this country be cry out for change but they feel they be just get more of the same of course it be the conservative party that wreck the public finance but we be eight month into the new government and people be leave wonder where be the change that be promise the chancellor say that the world be change so why will she not change course with it the chancellor say she want dash for growth but with her national insurance job tax she shoot herself in the foot before she even cross the start line after the government disastrous budget the government have the chance today to change direction fix our finance kick start growth and deliver small business budget the government could have scrap the job tax which will hammer our high street and instead ask the big bank social medium giant and online gambling company to pay their fair share instead the government could have change their approach to trade launch talk to boost growth through new trading deal with our european neighbour instead the government have make the wrong decision to cut public service hit disabled people and inflict more pain on our small business and high street in do so they have deliver no change and almost no growth at all after year of conservative mismanagement people can see just how broken our public service be they can not see gp they can not see dentist they be fight for an education plan and they be pick up the piece of broken social care system everything be break nothing work that be why people be impatient for the change they be promise we have to bring the welfare bill down and support more people into work that be right for people and our economy but cut support for someone who need help get dress and wash in the morning be not just wrong it do absolutely nothing to support that person into work if anything it do the exact opposite it will also have knock on impact for the entitlement of their family carer too will the chancellor come clean about this if the government be serious about cut welfare spending they must get serious about fix health and social care will the chancellor speed up the social care review and ensure that it conclude no later than the end of this year in the chancellor quest to slim down the civil service wonder why she have not look at the mountain of red tape create by the previous government terrible trade deal with europe whopping billion extra piece of paper have have to be complete by business since brexit enough to wrap around the world time if we manage to cut the red tape we can give british business tailwind deliver far more growth than be currently predict increase the fiscal headroom to deal with global headwind and free up precious time and money in our civil service that would be real change business be promise change too today statement should have be small business budget we liberal democrats have repeatedly raise the alarm about the impending damage of the national insurance job tax big business rate bill and change to relief for family farm and family business those change will be hammer blow to small and family business leave community face the prospect of an epidemic of board up shopfront they will be hammer blow to community health and care provider who stop our nhs from fall over this be not the change that be promise instead say again that the chancellor should look again at much fairer way to raise the tax revenue our public service desperately need by reform capital gain tax more fairly and ask the big bank the social medium giant and the online gambling company to pay their fair share know the chancellor must contend with president trump trade war which be cause global economic turmoil but our response to trump bullying can not be to cower in the corner and just hope that he be nice to we we can not sit on our hand while british steel be hit with trump tariff we liberal democrats warmly welcome the chancellor move to raise defence spending to of gdp but instead of cut the aid budget which abandon the world poor and damage our soft power she should be cover the cost by raise the digital service tax hand the tab to elon musk and trump other billionaire backer at the very least can the chancellor categorically rule out any reduction in the tech tax in an attempt to appease the white house especially when disabled people in britain face eye watering cut to conclude have series of question will the chancellor recognise that cut public service that be already stretch be false economy will she accept that try to bring down the welfare bill without fix health and social care be road to nowhere will she listen to the warning of small and family business that her job tax will do more harm than good will she look at the fairer way of raise revenue that we liberal democrats have put forward and will she take the bold action we need to grow our economy by rebuild our broken trading relationship with europe the public be promise change where on earth be it the hon lady say where be the change let tell she more money into our nhs with million additional appointment and waiting list fall five month in row roll out breakfast club in primary school from april this year increase defence spending to protect we in more uncertain world additional support for carer the living wage up the employment rights bill and so much more that be the difference we have make in nine month and we have only just get start the hon lady talk about trade we believe in free trade we be an open trading economy and we benefit from trade link around the world include with our single big trading partner the united states of america it be right that we work with our ally in the united states to ensure that that free and open trade continue that be in our national interest and this government will always act in our national interest at the same time there will as the hon lady know be summit between the uk and the eu in may where we will look to re set our relationship so we can see more free trade and the well flow of trade especially for our small business to be able to export around europe the hon lady talk about welfare she have not admit that there be single problem in the welfare system as it exist today be not willing and this party be not willing to write off one in eight young people who be not in education employment or training it be why for example we announce this week with my right hon friend the secretary of state for education an additional training place to train people up in the construction industry of the future and billion package of personalised target support because there be many disabled people the hon lady know this who be desperate to work but be not get the support and be deny support by the previous government that be why we have say there will be additional support for the most sick and disabled and that personal support for get people back into work that be the right approach so that we have protection for those who need it work for those who can and sustainable system that be here for generation into the future want to take on the hon lady main point she want all the money for public service but she do not want to raise the taxis to pay for they at the moment we spend billion year in interest on government debt it seem that she would just like more of that debt she say that people can not see gp or dentist how do she and the opposition party think that we pay for those thing they can not object to the tax increase and support the money we have invest in our public service to say otherwise be afraid be fairytale and the magic money tree it just do not add up the difference on the labour benches be that we will put money into our public service explain where it come from and ensure that the public finance be on firm footing that be the difference between our party and the opposition party young people in my constituency and indeed across the country have have an incredibly difficult time grow up austerity see their further education budget cut by then there be pandemic and now war in europe will the chancellor please set out how her plan to get britain building again will help my young constituent get the good non graduate job they need in loughborough shepshed and the village my hon friend speak powerfully on behalf of his constituent in loughborough the million additional home the government be build will ensure that family in loughborough have chance of get on the housing ladder and that young people in loughborough will have the opportunity to help build those home that be the difference we be make more job pay decent wage and more home for our family hope the chancellor next wednesday in front of the treasury committee will reiterate her commitment not to come back with more tax increase on page five of the obr report paragraph state while the government planning reform deliver modest boost to the level of potential output of per cent in its cumulative growth between and be still percentage point low than we project in october and the level of productivity be over per cent low would like to know what the chancellor think about that and can she confirm that the employment rights bill have not be evaluate by the obr the key point in what the right hon gentleman say be that cumulative growth be low from to the end of the forecast of course this government do not come into power in we come into power in july the obr number show that the economy be big because of the change we have make it be just difference in the date look forward to come to the treasury committee next week and be sure will take more question from the right hon gentleman then the chancellor have rightly champion economic stability in stark contrast to the previous government indeed in stark contrast to the previous five chancellor yet as she have say the world be become more unstable and that global instability feed through to rapid change in official projection which can constrain our room for action can the chancellor reaffirm to we that she will keep her focus on fiscal stability despite these challenge to meet the long term mission of this government to defend our country improve living standard and protect the most vulnerable in our society my hon friend be absolutely right that her constituent all our constituent depend on economic stability it ensure that they know how much they will pay on their rent and mortgage it ensure that they be not catch out when they go to the shop by price constantly rise that be why as government we have say that the no thing we need to achieve in order to grow our economy be economic stability which be why be so pleased that the bank of england have be able to cut interest rate three time since the general election and the obr have forecast that inflation will fall rapidly to next year and then in the year after that school face huge rise in cost imminently due to the rise in national insurance contribution headteacher have be reassure by the government that school would be recompense with money to cover these cost yet sir robert pattinson academy in my constituency great school find itself short will the chancellor commit to ensure that sir robert pattinson and indeed all the school in my constituency be give enough money to cover her job tax public service include school have be compensate for the increase in national insurance but be happy for the hon lady to get in touch with or the education secretary to set out the case of that school the only reason we have be able to put record investment into our school be because of the stability we have return to the economy include the tax increase that we have to bring forward last year in order to provide that extra money for our public service include the school in the hon lady constituency recognise the difficulty that my right hon friend be face with the fiscal challenge and so on that she inherit also support the reform that my right hon friend the work and pensions secretary have set out however all the evidence point to the fact that the cut to health and disability benefit will lead to increase poverty include severe poverty and worsen health condition how will make people sicker and poor help to drive our economy up and get people into job as my hon friend know we set out in the green paper that we be consult on premium payment for the most severely sick and disabled because as government we believe that those who need support should get it like my hon friend recognise that there be many people who be sick and disabled however there be also many young people who could be work but be write off by the previous government and that be why we be put record investment into help those people to get back into work with guarantee personalised target support someone be half as likely to be in poverty if they move from welfare into work we be determined to lift people out of poverty by ensure that there be good job that pay decent wage and with security guarantee through the employment rights bill the obr say that the information it receive on the package of welfare cut be late contain insufficient detail and that the estimate be highly uncertain and it will now have to certify they in the next forecast can the chancellor confirm whether that mean the government will have to go far with even deep cut to welfare than they have so far announce the obr have not take into account any of the package of measure to get people back into work or look at any behavioural effect of people make that switch into work it say in that document that it will spend the summer look at the entirety of the package include the effort we be make with huge package to get people back into work be confident that that personalise targeted support will get more people into work and lift they out of poverty so that they can support their family and so that the economy can benefit from their contribution fiscal responsibility under this government unlike the previous administration ensure that people be pay less and keep the cost of live down however as the labour party we have an additional social responsibility so can we look at those dwp change again of course we have to protect the most vulnerable but we be really worried about the people just above that band who be set to lose out thank my hon friend for that question and share the deep concern feel by everyone on the government benches in fact everyone in this chamber about the most sick and disabled who need support that be why we have set out in the green paper that we be consult on an additional premium payment to the most severely disabled it be also why instead of write people off and not provide the support that they need to do job that match their ability and need we be provide that personalise target support be at jobcentre last week in pudsey in my constituency where hear amazing story of work coach help people into work who be far from the labour market we want to see more of that we want to lift people out of poverty and help they to achieve their potential at the general election the chancellor promise growth and no increase in taxis but as chancellor she have deliver no growth and record increase in taxis now the office for budget responsibility be halve her growth forecast this year with cumulatively half percent less over the forecast period more worryingly it be forecast more than reduction in productivity growth why do she think that be have huge respect for the hon lady but that question do not do her justice as say to the right hon member for salisbury john glen early with the starting point of cumulative growth be low however the general election do not take place in it take place in the economy be big at the end of this parliament than the obr forecast previously those be the number and the fact and that be the difference that this labour government be make also congratulate the chancellor on her excellent statement which address the challenge the previous government leave she with in order to drive growth across the uk new heavy and light rail infrastructure be badly need what work be the chancellor do to develop new model of funding to deliver those important project thank my hon friend for that question one of the reason we have put an additional billion into capital spending over the forecast period be to invest in the infrastructure that our country need include transport infrastructure which know my hon friend as chair of the transport committee have keen interest in she be absolutely right we do need to look more at how we can leverage in private sector funding for whole range of project include the low thames crossing declare an interest as an alumnus of london business school the chancellor will recall that in november when she come to the treasury committee ask she to look at london business school paper on use specific public on defence spending to boost economic growth be delighted to hear that the treasury do evaluate that paper by professor paolo surico as part of the spring statement and have listen to and the liberal democrats do the chancellor agree that use defence spending focus on public be one way to not only keep we safe but raise productivity and boost economic growth thank the hon gentleman for his question and look forward to take more question from he at the treasury committee next week when visit defence company or meet our armed force they tell about the amazing ability of new technology and innovation to help they to well do their job and keep our country safe as we invest more in defence and get to of gdp it be absolutely right as have set out today that more of that money be use for innovation and new technology congratulate my right hon friend on grasp the challenge and opportunity that this new world present we with those opportunity will mean that in my constituency of glasgow south west there will be more investment in the defence sector which be timely because after year of snp government one in six people in my constituency be economically inactive do she agree that this investment will finally raise their ambition and their pay packet unlike the snp labour support investment and job in the defence sector in scotland which in turn support people in glasgow south west and across scotland there will be more good job for young people more job pay decent wage that will keep our country safe that be what this party believe in it be shame that the snp believe in something entirely different cloud hang over the economy in northern lincolnshire at the moment with potentially significant job loss at the scunthorpe steelwork in view of that can the chancellor assure we that funding will be available not only to look after any redundant worker but to attract new business and provide retrain for exist worker at the general election we set out our plan for steel fund as part of the national wealth fund understand the concern of hon member across the house about the future of the steel industry in this country we be able to improve the deal for tata to protect more job in south wales we want thriving steel sector right across the uk and we will continue to work with the company and the trade union to achieve just that make cut instead of tax wealth be political choice and take away the personal independence payment from so many disabled people be an especially cruel choice disabled person who can not cut up their own food without assistance can not go to the toilet without assistance and can not wash themselves without assistance will lose their personal independence payment have not the government take the easy option of cut support for disabled people rather than the braver option which would be to tax the wealthy through wealth tax there be nothing progressive nothing labour about not support people who be disabled or sick or who be young to do job that be commensurate with what they be able to do one in eight young people have be effectively write off by the conservative party and we be not willing to leave they in that position we be consult in the green paper on an additional premium to pay to the most sick and disabled people because we recognise that they need support from the state but too many people be not give the opportunity to fulfil their potential and we be not willing to carry on like that in the budget last year we get rid of the non dom tax status increase capital gain tax introduce vat on private school and change the rule on inheritance tax so do not recognise what my hon friend say the chancellor tell we that the world have change if that be true and it allow she to stick the boot into disabled people it must also be true to allow she to review her income tax rate perhaps make they commensurate with those in scotland which see the scottish economy grow in january by while the uk economy contract by she could also choose to revise the government position on re access the european union single market which would allow billion recur return with no compensation require she could impose tax on asset over million wealth tax as the hon member for leeds east richard burgon have just highlight which would allow billion recur return every year with no need for compensation if she have the disabled the waspi woman pensioner and hospice in her cross hair why can she not tap up multi millionaire for few quid the world have change and we can see that all around we which be why our defence be more important than other thing that be why it be so astonishing that the snp continue to oppose the nuclear deterrent commend the chancellor for her statement do she agree that the conservative party do not understand the link between its total failure to build house and infrastructure which our constituent desperately want and the economic constraint that we face today my hon friend speak powerfully on behalf of her constituent in birmingham we need to build the home that all our constituent be cry out for the level of home ownership decline under the previous government and we be determined to turn that around as well as to build the affordable and social house that our country need as we build those home there will be more good job for young people who take pride in their work those good job which will pay decent wage will be back by the increase in the national living wage and by our employment rights bill the transport secretary fail to stand up to the transport union the health and social care secretary fail to stand up to the health union and the work and pensions secretary fail to stand up to the back benchers of her own party the chancellor saving be predicate on get rid of whole tranche of civil servant how can we have any confidence that she or the prime minister will stand up to the civil service union today as part of the transformation fund we have set aside million next year for redundancy cost for voluntary exit settlement which show how serious we be about reduce the size of the civil service after it increase to record level under the conservative party community such as mine in barrow and furness feel very acutely the failure of the previous government as they leave we in dreadful state do the chancellor agree that it be through this government commitment to and funding in barrow and furness and our defence sector that we can transform thing on the ground which will mean that barrow can be blueprint for how the defence pound can be well spend across our constituency know that my hon friend be incredibly proud to represent barrow and furness and that her constituent be incredibly proud to work on our nuclear deterrent this government will always stand with they put in place our new plan for barrow for new job and new investment in the town so that we get value for money for taxpayer and critically ensure our country national security the chancellor be right to highlight productivity as an issue and right too to focus on skill shortage although she do not explicitly note the implicit link between they she fail however to say that her productivity ambition have be scale back and that the number of young people not in education employment or training be grow will she set out perhaps in note in the library of the house or in statement by how much she expect apprenticeship to grow year on year when be minister we reach the high level in modern time and the number be much low now we need to grow apprenticeship to build our skill and to grow productivity if she do not do that we will feel that hope exceed expectation thank the right hon gentleman for that question he speak powerfully about something that he know huge amount about let answer three part of that question first the obr have revise up our productivity in its forecast secondly we have massive problem with young people not in education employment or training it involve one in eight young people however as say in answer to previous question the obr have not take into account the impact of our back to work programme it will work on that over the summer with the dwp and the treasury because we want to make sure that we design that in way that get as many young people back into work contribute to the economy and contribute to our society we be able to announce just couple of week ago in national apprenticeship week an expansion of the apprenticeship programme particularly through foundation apprenticeship and by relax some of the math and english requirement if we want to build the home that our country need we need to get people into construction job and not say sorry you do get grade in math and english so you not welcome on the construction site that make no sense at all which be why we be reform how apprenticeship work to get more people with the skill they need so that they can contribute to their family and the economy we want those number go up our fiscal rule be design to ensure that we do not repeat the damaging austerity of the conservative party which harm my constituent so much do my right hon friend agree that it be only because of those fiscal rule that the obr have today confirm that people in paisley and renfrewshire south will be on average year well off with this labour government to ensure that people be well off we need to control inflation which be why stability be so important bring interest rate down and the bank of england have have the confidence to cut interest rate three time since the election and boost wage which we be begin to see with real wage grow at twice the rate of inflation that benefit my hon friend constituent and people up and down the country that be why we welcome the fact that today the obr have revise up real household disposable income per person by today and last week the chancellor rush through severe cut to the benefit system that will hit some of the most vulnerable in our society although we should have consider benefit reform this be ill conceive can the chancellor explain to the chamber why she be choose to balance the book of the nation on the back of some of the most vulnerable in our society have huge respect for the hon gentleman but everybody in this house and across the country can see that the welfare system be just not work one in eight young people be not in education employment or training and people be go on to personal independence payment every single day and we can not carry on like that the basic principle of this government be that people who need support should be protect that those who can work should work and will be support with personalised targeted support and that we need system that be sustainable that be what the reform set out by my right hon friend the work and pensions secretary last week deliver alongside that there will be further consultation on the green paper to make sure that those with the most severe need get the additional support that they be rightly entitle to rise order we have another minute on the statement if question be short more member will get in it be absolutely right that the opposition devastate our community and leave we with billion of pound worth of debt but it be not right that disabled people and the most vulnerable in our society should pay for it thousand of my constituent continue to be fearful about the announce welfare cut and disability organisation have warn that hundred of thousand of people will be push into poverty so say to the chancellor we must make the right political choice we must protect the most vulnerable in society and introduce wealth tax so that multimillionaire and billionaire can pay their fair share my hon friend represent the constituency that neighbour mine he know as do that there be far too many people in both our constituency in leeds and bradford who be write off there be people who be not work who be quite capable of work if they be give support people may be disabled but it do not mean that they can not work and contribute if they be give the proper support that be what the conservative party fail to do and that be what our government be determined to deliver we will work with disabled group and jobcentre include the one in pudsey where be last week to make sure that we support people to fulfil their potential and do not just write they off like the conservatives do welcome the chancellor emphasis on defence expenditure and her support for the nuclear deterrent but do she agree that by his action in ukraine putin have restart the cold war will she bear in mind that during the up to the end of the cold war we be regularly spend between and of gdp on defence that be the sort of scale that be require the right hon gentleman have long be an advocate of spend properly on defence we have set out fully fund and cost plan to get to of gdp in the next two year and to in the next parliament the world have change we can see that all around we this government will always put our national security and defence first and as the situation evolve of course so will we thank the chancellor for her statement she be absolutely right to highlight the stimulus that the employment rights bill will bring to our economy but respectfully say that the impact of the cut to welfare payment will be reduce income for some of my poor constituent that contrast with the easy ride that the very wealthy get from low margin of tax on their asset and gain than my constituent face through income tax the world indeed have change since the chancellor set her fiscal rule so will she consider put capital gain tax on an equal footing with income tax or implement wealth tax of on asset worth over million in order to improve the country finance at the budget last autumn we increase taxis by billion without ask work people to pay more we do that by abolish the non dom tax status increase the rate of capital gain tax tighten the rule around inheritance tax and yes by ask business to pay more as well we have already raise taxis to put more money into our health service reduce nhs waiting list and provide free breakfast club at primary school today spring statement show that we can grow the size of our economy through planning reform and therefore ensure more money for our public service the government no priority be growth so be so pleased that the obr have say that by the end of this parliament the economy will be big than that we inherit it from the conservatives the chancellor have claim today that she be build foundation for the economy but sadly those foundation be build on sand increase borrowing high inflation low growth job taxis and so on how will such structure stand against the economic force that will be affect the united kingdom as she have describe today specifically what proportion of the transformation fund will be available to the northern ireland executive for the important transformation of public service in northern ireland thank the right hon gentleman for his question the obr be clear that the economy at the end of this parliament will be big than it previously envisage big than the plan we inherit from the previous government and the average person with real household disposable income will see their income rise by we be already begin to deliver the change that we promise at the budget last year be able to announce the big ever settlement for scotland wales and northern ireland that continue to be the case after today spring statement reckless management of public finance lead to high cost of government borrowing as any economist will say that increase the cost of capital across the british economy put at risk and increase the cost of the essential investment in housing and infrastructure that my constituent desperately need do my right hon friend agree that that be very important reason why it be essential to manage public finance carefully unlike the last conservative government and unlike the government in scotland who be overfamiliar with emergency budgets my hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of robust fiscal rule which even in difficult economic circumstance we will continue to meet through the decision that have set out today the reason that economic stability be so important can be see in what happen in the last parliament where government borrow beyond their mean the people who lose out be not the wealthy but ordinary work people who pay more in the shop and more on their mortgage and rent this government will never repeat the mistake of liz truss and the conservatives the chancellor have create storm and be now complain about the rain she increase spending to billion she increase borrowing by billion and she increase tax by billion yet the economy shrink in january she talk about change and the abolition of nhs england in write question ask the department how much that would cost and it say that there would be some up front cost but could not specify what they would be could she tell the estimate cost of this top down change to abolish nhs england it be really difficult to understand what the conservative party want do they want to reduce the cost of admin and bureaucracy or do they want to carry on with everything the way it be we want to change thing that be why the transformation fund that set out today include million for voluntary exit scheme we want more money on the frontline not in the back office in bloated bureaucracy that be leave by the conservatives there be so much to welcome in today statement but the chancellor will be aware of serious concern regard welfare reform constituent tell last week terrified of what will happen to if can work already have thought of suicide at the prospect of these change and what they will mean for disabled people today

support to get people back into work we be determined to work with business and ensure that more people with sickness and disability can stay in work contribute to their family finance and to the wide economy do the chancellor agree that gdp as measure of growth and relative wealth be not the most relevant number to our constituent as we be live in an age of mass immigration and rise population surely what matter to our constituent be gdp per capita which have fall consistently for the past two year and be fall still should we not tell people that actually they be get poor the obr forecast that gdp per capita will increase by during this parliament have fall under the previous government if the hon gentleman ever get to clacton he can tell his constituent that welcome the chancellor

difference that this labour government be make the chancellor know that our economy have be drive to the edge over the past year with ordinary people force to bear the burden while small minority have amass extreme wealth she could change that her own back benchers be line up to argue for wealth tax why will she not do the fair and right thing and introduce tax on the very wealthy rather than

agree that the main contrast between this government and the last one be strength versus weakness they be too weak to crack down on wasteful spending to address the tax break and loophole for the wealthy and to take on the blocker in the planning system do she far agree that while the conservatives the party of vested interest seek to conserve what have fail this labour government have the strength to take the tough long term decision to build well and much fair britain today the obr have score some of our planning measure which will make the economy billion big by the end of the

into capital spending during the course of this parliament and have be able to announce an additional billion today unlike the conservative party be not willing to cut capital investment because it be absolutely crucial to grow the economy and leverage the private sector investment that we need the chancellor have make much of the government investment in defence and desire to make the country

intelligence operation centre europe and the nato intelligence fusion centre there be huge investment in site such as the alconbury weald enterprise campus and brampton cross and the potential redevelopment of ministry of defence land around raf wyton it be the perfect location for defence start up and with the arrival of several already in flight the us government be invest north of million in huntingdon alone will she make similar commitment to huntingdon and include it in her list of defence site what great pitch be sure that one of the ministers from the ministry of defence

also support we become defence industrial superpower be sure that we can work with the hon gentleman to realise those ambition for huntingdon the conservatives leave billion hole in our public finance and they continue to oppose every decision make by the chancellor to clean up their mess can the chancellor tell we how thing would look now if the conservatives have their way what it would mean for people in kettering and around the country if we have continue under the plan of the previous government be that interest rate would have remain high inflation would have remain high and growth would continue to flatline whereas the obr today have forecast that real household disposable income will rise growth will be high and living standard will be high because we have return stability to the economy and we be back the builder not the blocker interruption do not wish to interrupt the discussion on the front benches have another opportunity for the chancellor in cheltenham we have scheme that can produce job and growth and will support the defence industry the golden valley development next to gchq which will be key part of this country defence investment over the come year will the chancellor take it upon herself to work with ministers in other department who already know about that to ensure that we get the investment that we deserve and that gchq worker deserve too be proud of what gchq do to keep our country safe part of what we be do around the defence budget above the lift to be include some of the work of the security service that increasingly be crucial for our national security and defence that be on top of the as we protect defence spending it be right that we take into account gchq and other security agency as well be very happy to work with the hon

huge opportunity for scottish worker be delighted to have her visit rosyth in my constituency recently will she work to ensure continuous shipbuilding programme in this country to maximise the opportunity for scottish worker do she agree that it be utterly shameful that those worker have be ignore by the snp for the past year also will she confirm that this labour government will always value the role of shipbuilding for our economy and our national defence could not agree more with my hon friend it be just shame that there be no snp member in the chamber although there be so few of they to hear what he say perhaps my hon friend would write to the snp and ask they why they refuse to back the defence sector in the united kingdom and specifically in scotland it be estimate that in under five year there will be more than million family in receipt of disability benefit who will lose financially as result of today announcement with an average loss of per year compare to inflation be the chancellor comfortable know that she have bring despair and horror to disabled people and their family across the country we have very basic principle that people who deserve to be protect should be that those who can work should and that we need system that be sustainable we do not have any of those three thing today that be why we be reform our welfare system to give additional support for those with the high need to give personalise target and guarantee support to help people back into work and to ensure that we have system that be sustainable so that it be there for generation to come as the chancellor will know the east midland be often at the bottom of investment league table and we suffer through lack of transport planning will the chancellor outline how the extra public investment and the national wealth fund will change that and deliver for people in north east derbyshire thank my hon friend for that question people in north east derbyshire will benefit from the additional home whether they be able to buy those home rent those home or indeed build those home as we expand the number of construction apprenticeship and construct new technical excellence college they will also benefit from the increase in real household disposable income when the economy grow we want to have more money in people pocket and that be what the obr today confirm will happen pharmacy such as green end pharmacy in whitchurch in my constituency be struggle with the impending hike in employer national insurance and business rate in fact they do not know what they be be pay for nhs service this financial year let alone next will the chancellor confirm whether pharmacy first will continue beyond the end of next week be sure that the relevant health minister will be willing to meet with the hon lady to talk about that because of the investment that we put into our national health service at the budget last year more than billion of additional funding we be able to start to rebuild our nhs and reduce waiting list indeed we have do that now for five month in row as we secure britain role in change world welcome the chancellor focus on defence innovation and thank she for reference my community aldershot and farnborough we be ready to serve when it come to defence innovation too many small and medium defence business in my community struggle to get access to the banking and finance facility they need often on the basis of self impose environmental social and governance criterion will the chancellor join in welcome the investor and financial institution that have respond to the campaign that be lead with my hon friend the member for york outer mr charters call on our bank and our fund manager to broaden their approach so that we can defend our country support ukraine and fire up our industrial base be pleased to mention my hon friend constituency in my statement as the home of the british army on behalf of this government we thank the

that our fantastic defence start up have the money that they need to grow and help defend our country and our value for the final question call jim allister will the chancellor well explain how the civil service cut will translate into the devolved region and the impact on future block grant allocation be there lesson to be learn from the fact that in the northern ireland executive have voluntary exit scheme upon which it spend million and then proceed to re engage hundred of civil servant as agency worker the hon gentleman make really important point that be why we have not set number for the reduction in the size of the civil service and instead have make it an admin target we do not want the number of civil servant to fall and then the number of agency worker and consultancy to increase absolutely this government will learn from fail effort both of the uk government under the conservatives and other administrations in the past cornish language and heritage education and recognition motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about the teaching and promotion of the cornish language in educational institution to make provision about the recognition of the cornish language and cornish heritage and for connected purpose today be not just about preserve the cornish language or kernewek in cornish it be about protect cultural identity that be weave into the fabric of cornwall past present and our future cornish can be trace back year over that time cornish speaker be drive further west due to conflict and invasion from europe but it be our fisherman who keep the language alive until it fade in the century despite this cornish be officially recognise as regional language by the uk government in under part of the european charter for regional or minority language this be landmark moment affirm that cornish alongside welsh scottish gaelic irish scots and ulster scots be language to be protect and promote the uk government have commit to support those language yet cornish remain at part status while four of the other five celtic language have part protection which offer strong commitment in area such as education public life and the medium in november the european charter for regional or minority languages issue recommendation urge the uk government to take strong measure to support minority language include enhance educational provision and promote language awareness this bill would work in lockstep with those recommendation and strengthen the uk commitment to linguistic diversity recognition of kernewek be grow but it need sustained support cornwall council and the cornish national minority working group have champion its survival through initiative such as go cornish which now reach over primary school child in school include dobwalls community primary and menheniot primary school in south east cornwall yet cornish be still not formally embed in secondary or high education gcse in cornish once exist but be discontinue in the option to learn should always be available and the government own charter commitment state that minority language education should be strengthen and we must ensure that learn cornish be viable accessible option not requirement but choice for those who wish to engage with their cultural heritage teach cornish should not be an add burden for overstretched school but rather an exciting opportunity for student who wish to learn the go cornish programme prove that effective teaching can be do without increase teacher workload as it provide structured resource sound file and low administration learning model it align with ofsted cultural capital framework which encourage school to celebrate cultural tradition and history beyond school there must be provision to provide lifelong learning opportunity at present hundred of people sign up for kernewek class each year and university such as exeter and cambridge have previously offer kernewek course if welsh and gaelic can be successfully integrate into high education why not cornish language visibility in public life be crucial for its survival currently cornish do not have official status in cornwall nor be there any legislative requirement for its promotion however cornwall council have work hard since to implement strategy promote the language want to see this work and local effort strengthen by increase the use of cornish in road sign place name and public service kernewek be beautiful and expressive language reflect

understand these meaning not only improve our knowledge of the language but deepen our sense of belong and connection to cornwall history landscape and identity the media act now ensure that public service broadcaster must consider content in regional and minority language include cornish yet obstacle remain to effort to enhance visibility and normalise everyday use of the language in medium such as local radio television and online platform cornwall distinct culture be not just historical it be live and evolve support cornish in public life be not about exclude english but about embrace bilingualism as strength we have see this work successfully in wales and scotland and cornwall should not be leave behind support cornish language and heritage be not just cultural necessity it also

signage can enhance visitor experience while reinforce our local identity this be not about sell our identity it be about strengthen it the commercialisation of linguistic heritage must be do responsibly to ensure it benefit cornish people first and foremost cornwall language and culture be deeply connect to our natural environment and it be not just aesthetic it be part of our identity

the alarming rise of youth vaping while vaping be less harmful than smoke and can be an effective quit aid for adult smoker child should never vape however in the past five year youth vaping have more than double one in four to year old try vape in and that be no accident it be in part due to the deliberate branding and advertisement of vape to our child with brightly coloured packaging and entice sweet like flavour calculate strategy to hook young people on nicotine we can not afford to wait to act turn to the government amendment which seek to strengthen the bill and ensure great clarity as we create the first smokefree generation and strengthen age restriction on vape and nicotine product we want to support retailer in take appropriate step to ensure they do not sell to customer under the age of sale new clause and government amendment to to to to and be package of amendment and consequential amendment to the bill they seek to remove potential ambiguity for retailer regard the use of digital identity for verify the age of prospective customer when sell tobacco vaping and nicotine product in committee members raise concern that the list of identity document to satisfy the defence for person charge with sell product to someone under the age of sale be limited and query the inclusion of other form of physical and digital identity these amendment remove the list of physical id from the bill and instead provide power for the secretary of state and the department of health in northern ireland to specify in regulation the step that may be take to verify customer age to meet the requirement for the defence this revised approach well future proof the defence against development in identification process and provide the potential to recognise digital id as well as physical id in the context of the defence support the widespread use of digital id the amendment provide the opportunity for effective interaction with part of the data use and access bill that be currently go through parliament which include provision relate to digital verification service digital verification service provide an opportunity to securely verify age for in person and online sale we will continue to work closely with the department for science innovation and technology and other departments when develop the regulation new clause provide similar power for scottish ministers to prescribe in regulation the step that should be take to establish customer age as defence to an age of sale offence that will enable scottish ministers to respond to change in technology and consumer behaviour which may move away from the presentation of physical document the last labour government take bold action to prohibit display of tobacco product to protect child and young people from be entice into addiction and to create more supportive environment for adult seek to quit the bill go far and give power to limit the display of wide range of product include herbal smoking product cigarette paper vape and nicotine product government amendment and will alter the power in the bill for england wales and northern ireland that regulate display of product and their price so that they also cover tobacco relate device as be discuss in committee pipe heated tobacco device and bong be currently display in shop and can have the effect of promote tobacco usage the amendment will ensure that we can make regulation to stop product that facilitate the consumption of tobacco be openly display by retailer the bill ban the sale of vape nicotine product and cigarette paper from vend machine in england wales and northern ireland and restate the exist ban on tobacco vending machine we know that vend machine be use to bypass age of sale restriction and to undertake proxy purchase on behalf of people under the age of sale government amendment and be clarify amendment that make the scope of the prohibition on vend machine absolutely clear as be discuss in committee the government position be that the protection from tobacco sale from vending machines england regulations already apply where customer have coupon receipt or token purchase elsewhere that can be redeem at machine we be amend the clause so that all machine that dispense product in connection with sale be clearly capture by the ban the bill strengthen the enforcement regime to support law abide retailer while take action against those who break the rule along with introduce new fix penalty notice and new power to create licensing system the bill re enact provision on restrict premise order and restrict sale order those be exist measure that local authority trading standard in england and wales can use when deal with retailer that persistently breach restriction that ensure there be range of tool in the enforcement armoury so that trading standard officer can act quickly and effectively against rogue retailer government amendment and clarify point raise in committee by remove duplicative and unnecessary provision that would prevent business or individual from operate vend machine for the sale of tobacco vaping or nicotine product follow the issuing of restrict premise order or restricted sale order give that the bill already prohibit the use of vend machine for tobacco vaping or nicotine product there be no need for restrict premise order and restrict sale order to expressly prohibit the use of vend machine together the government amendment will improve the implementation and enforceability of measure in the bill to ensure the most effective protection for the public and commend they to the house turn to the other amendment in the group thank hon member for their scrutiny of the bill so far when wind up will try to cover the key theme that be touch on on the amendment that seek to undermine the smokefree generation be sure we will hear argument from some hon member who have be listen to the tobacco industry argument and myth about how people should be free to make their own choice would say to they that smoke kill two third of its user three quarter of people wish they have never start smoke and the majority want to quit that be not freedom of choice the tobacco industry take away that choice with addiction usually at young age on smokefree place we have be clear in england we intend to consult on extend smokefree outdoor place to outside school child playground and hospital but not to outdoor hospitality setting at this time no smoker want to harm people but with second hand smoke they do if people can smell smoke they be inhale it this be particularly important for child pregnant woman and people with pre exist health condition such as asthma or heart disease the only way to stop this harm be to stop people smoke around other while understand hon member proposal to list specific place in the bill or to add additional limit to the use of the power it be right that we consult on the detail before make regulation and have the necessary power to protect child and vulnerable people from the harm of second hand smoking be grateful to the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on smoking and health my hon friend the member for city of durham mary kelly foy and the hon member for harrow east bob blackman for their long stand support for the bill through their amendment they highlight the importance of retain focus on support for current smoker that be why we be invest an extra million for local stop smoke service this year and work to ensure that all nhs hospital offer opt out smoking cessation service into routine care hope they will be pleased that we have be able to confirm the extension of the swap to stop scheme for the come year with up to million of funding to provide free vape starter kit for smoker to use as quit aid on the group of amendment relate to vape advertising we realise that product be deliberately market at child be unacceptable which be why we have include commitment to stop vape be brand and advertise to child the government be also invest million of new funding for the come year for national trading standards to tackle underage illicit tobacco and vape and to boost the trading standard workforce by recruit new apprentice provide additional boot on the ground trading standard be really important and obviously therefore so be fix penalty notice so will the minister support amendment which would mean that any fix penalty notice sum will be retain by local authority to spend on public health thus save the nhs money as she mention early as the hon member will know there be already measure in the bill that allow some of the fine to be retain they can certainly be retain to make it cost neutral for local authority but be sure we will explore that issue later on the bill contain regulation make power on range of aspect of product requirement that already allow we to do many thing that hon member seek to achieve but look forward to listen to the contribution to today debate on the wide list of amendment and to respond to the point that be make call the opposition spokesperson it be now truth universally acknowledge that smoking be bad for one health it be the lead cause of preventable death in this country responsible for over death every year when we say that number it be easy to allow it to trip off the tongue as another statistic without really realise just how many people it represent for each of they such as my nana burton who be smoker and who die of lung cancer there be personal story of damaged health and often an early and preventable death the conservative party introduce bill base on similar premise to this one in the last parliament although the government have make significant change since to the legislation include take power that could be use to ban smoking and vaping in pub garden as well as licensing scheme for tobacco product on amendment while we have receive repeat assurance that the secretary of state intend to use the measure in the bill only to improve public health we must still examine whether the legislation be proportionate and reasonable as far as can see it give the secretary of state enormous power to extend the smokefree legislation to any place with minimal oversight and without need to provide reason there be whisper last summer that the government be consider ban smoking in pub garden before they hastily withdraw this provision in the face of public backlash if only they would withdraw more of their policy in the face of public backlash because perhaps then we would not be in the situation we be in now the bill empower the secretary of state to extend smokefree and vape free regulation to more place essentially to any place with the aim of reduce exposure to second hand smoke and promote public health however on second read the government do not accept our amendment that it should apply only to place that have provable significant risk to public health to justify such ban for that reason commend amendment once again which would restrict the secretary of state to be able to designate only open or unenclosed space outside hospital child playground nursery school college or high education premise as smokefree area those be the area the secretary of state have say he want to target and the amendment would prevent any targeting of other area such as pub garden by the back door while he claim that that be not his intention now that may not remain the case for the rest of this government time in office nor indeed for any future government that be the risk in allow these measure to stand and for those reason encourage the house to support amendment pm on new clause and amendment the new bill also give power to the secretary of state to introduce new licensing scheme for retailer sell tobacco vaping or nicotine product however we know that licensing scheme will come at cost to business and local authority that will administer they and in enforcement that do not make it the wrong thing to do but we would need to make sure that any licensing scheme be not excessively burdensome or expensive new clause and amendment would therefore require the government to consult on the new licensing scheme for tobacco sale before it come into force that would mean that the view and impact on business include small business be hear and ensure that council and trading standard have the capacity to deliver such scheme ultimately there be balance to strike between the requirement on business and public health and public consultation would ensure that the government be more likely to get that balance right on new clause another concern we have hear from those who oppose the bill be about the impact that the legislation would have on the black market his majesty revenue and customs estimate that the illicit market in tobacco duty and related vat be billion in with the tobacco duty tax gap remain broadly unchanged since while in the chartered trading standards institute estimate that staggering one in three vape product be non compliant give warning that increase the age requirement for tobacco product and prohibit more vaping could expand the black market economy far it be sensible to take precaution to tackle the issue specifically on new clause do my hon friend agree that it be inevitable that the generational smoking ban will lead to an increase in the illegal tobacco market and that that be highly regrettable consequence of the bill that be certainly significant possibility and that be the reason for move the amendment as my hon friend will understand illegal product can include smuggle and counterfeit cigarette vape with nicotine level way above the legal limit and product contain illegal and potentially dangerous ingredient they can be more harmful and may not include the appropriate labelling requirement and health warning that genuine product have to carry regardless of whether colleague support or oppose this bill as whole be sure we all agree that black market be unacceptable we have therefore put forward an amendment that would require the government to produce annual report on the rate of sale and availability of illegal tobacco and vaping product and their impact on public health and safety my hon friend have rightly take fierce line on illegal tobacco sale in lincolnshire do she acknowledge that those illegal tobacco sale be often link to serious and organised crime the shop that sell they be often link to money laundering and be usually foreign own by the way and the damage they do be extreme will she join in urge further action by government to support trading standard and the local police who be do such fine job in try to clamp down on this industrial scale crime as be usually the case find myself agree with my right hon friend and that be of course why we have table the amendment it will give we the evidence that we and the enforcement authority require to make sure that the black market be reduce do my hon friend accept that there be not risk that black market will open because significant black market in tobacco already exist in some billion cigarette be sell under duty whereas in the figure be billion reduction yet an action on smoking and health survey have find that smoking have reduce by only the black market be already here it be not new thing that will be create so the bill present an even great risk my hon friend make fair point we know the black market exist but the amendment would enable the government to understand the scale of that black market and the change in it so that regulation could be enforce more robustly on amendment as currently draft the legislation will ban all form of advertising of nicotine and non nicotine vape nicotine product and sponsorship that promote those product advert will no long be permit on poster billboard or the side of bus and sport team will be prevent from be sponsor by vape company as member of parliament and child doctor have be very concerned by the sharp increase in child addict to vaping and more recently the other nicotine product such as pouch that have begin to flood the market schoolteacher have report that child be unable to concentrate or even to complete whole lesson without visit the bathroom to vape action to tackle the rise in vaping be welcome and support step that restrict the appeal of vape to young people include through flavour and packaging however as the minister mention in her opening speech vaping can be useful smoking cessation tool for adult smoker try to quit in my view that should be their only purpose within the context of propose advertising restriction amendment would ensure that vape that be target solely as quit aid to help adult stop smoking can continue in recognition of their role in bring down smoking rate finally new clause would introduce requirement on online vaping product to operate an age verification policy as be currently the case in scotland whether someone be buy vaping product online or in store robust provision must be in place to ensure that the purchaser be of legal age and business must have robust policy in place as we have see through recent tragedy the age verification process for online sale on age restrict product have not always be effective the new clause would be an important step towards protect child from access product online that they should not be able to buy in closing the conservative party have strong record of action on tobacco control it be under conservative government that plain packaging be introduce for all tobacco product and that minimum pack size for cigarette and rolling tobacco be introduce policy that have be demonstrably effective at reduce smoking rate have personally campaign passionately on the issue of tobacco and vape for over two year and be pleased that some of my original amendment to the bill have make it beyond committee stage and be with we today be also glad to see some of the new government amendment introduce on report that be bear of debate we have in committee which have strengthen the bill our amendment be design to highlight some of the difficulty in the bill we oppose the government power grab create power to ban smoking and vape wherever they choose by regulation but without consultation or enough notice we have concern about how the bill will operate in practice especially the burden on small business and the potential for unintended consequence such as growth in the black market for tobacco product so we ask that the government seriously consider our amendment today welcome the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend the member for west lancashire ashley dalton to her role it be great pleasure to speak in the debate and to support this genuinely world lead piece of public health legislation which will help to consign smoking to the history book unless we act to help people to stay healthy the rise tide of ill health in our society threaten to overwhelm our nhs par back public health as the last government do be the definition of penny wise pound foolish it be vital that we tackle the cause of ill health not just the symptom so that we can save the taxpayer billion of pound and most importantly save life we know that prevention be well than cure as we have hear today smoking remain the single big preventable cause of ill health in our country cause death year it be responsible for one in four cancer death and it be factor in over of lung cancer case in my own constituency alone nearly people smoke they be more likely to leave the workforce due to ill health many will suffer stroke heart attack and condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on average they will lose year of life expectancy however the real tragedy be how many thousand of those smoker will have start when they be child when they do not know any well and have simply never be able to quit most smoker report wish that they have never start which be why it be incumbent on we all to support this legislation to help stop the start accord to ash in my constituency alone the cost of smoking exceed million every year include million in lose productivity million drain from the nhs and million in social care the cost of smoking to our society be enormous and that be why it be time to stub it out even today in hundred of young people day take the first drag of habit they will never manage to kick and will regret for the rest of their life be proud to lead the opposition response to the last government bill through committee in the last parliament and as say then there be no freedom in addiction it be shame that the leader of the conservative party allow her ideology to blind she from that fact when she vote against the legislation in the last parliament and against this bill in this one where the last government fail to get their tobacco and vapes bill over the line this government will get the job do be proud that the government have vastly improve on the legislation that the previous government draw up first the introduction of new licensing regime to cover tobacco and nicotine product include vape be hugely welcome that be key recommendation of the khan review in which the last government largely ignore and which retailer and the public overwhelmingly support accord to survey conduct by ash the status quo where there be no requirement to obtain licence to sell those product be major gap in enforcement particularly when we consider that the sale of alcohol be license while nicotine and tobacco be not secondly be pleased that the government be take forward an amendment table in committee during the last parliament for the introduction of on the spot fine for retailer sell product to under age people in to of the council that undertake test purchasing report that cigarette or tobacco product be sell to child who be under in at least one of their premise that prove that the current regime be not enough of deterrent the introduction of new on the spot fine which be double the amount propose by the previous government will be much easy to issue and much hard to ignore do the minister agree with that double the fine be double the deterrent thirdly commend ministers on the action they be take on vape under the last government youth vaping treble in two year an estimated one in three vape on the market be illicit and product often contain harmful chemical heavy metal or even drug gap loophole be leave to sit on the statute book for year put child at risk the promulgation of dangerous illicit vape in shop school and on our street be real concern recently in birmingham trading standard officer and the police lead raid on retailer under operation cloud when they seize nearly million worth of illicit vape tobacco and drug one raid alone the big ever in birmingham claw million worth of good out of criminal hand that show the extent of the problem of the illicit market and the incredible job that council trading standard team do to keep the public safe thank the government for get behind trading standard with million boost to support their work next year in particular welcome the new government introduction of clause to this bill to set up testing regime for vape proposal that champion in the last parliament it be shock that under the current rule unlike with tobacco there be no testing regime for vape product that mean that dodgy product can be rubber stamp by the british regulator and wind up on our shelf undermine the valuable enforcement work that trading standard do to identify and seize un notify product as testing of vape market at young people have show significant proportion of vaping product be not what they say they be some market themselves as nicotine when they be not lead to accidental addiction other contain harmful substance such as heavy metal and even anti freeze as evidence by research undertake by inter scientific that be why during the last parliament table amendment that would have establish new testing regime for vape unfortunately the conservatives vote they down commend ministers for introduce power that the previous government snub nearly million people have quit smoking use vape clearly vape have role to play in the transition to smokefree future but if they be to be use as stop smoke aid we need confidence that the product people buy be safe which be what routine testing would do finally commend the government on the amendment that have strengthen this bill they close the loophole on vape vend machine and ban vape advertising promotion and sponsorship the new clause will ensure that these product be keep away from the impressionable eye of young people so that the next generation be not simply substitute one nicotine addiction for another there be significant hole in the last government plan and be glad that the new government be slam they shut the health crisis face our country have never be confine to the running of its hospital ward doctor surgery and dental practice we be sicker nation and that public health challenge need confront life expectancy be extend by three and half year over the course of the last labour government but in the year under the tories it grow by just four month in this bill we see the epitome of the future face approach that only labour government can deliver by stop the start and ensure that the next generation never develop an addiction to nicotine we can protect their health and wellbeing and protect our nhs for many year to come call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for her opening remark and add my broad support for the improvement that the government have make to the bill will restrict my comment mainly to amendment and which have be table in my name and the name of my hon friend the members for winchester dr chambers for eastleigh liz jarvis for chichester jess brown fuller and for mid sussex alison bennett will also comment on new clause table by my hon friend the member for bath wera hobhouse to which have add my name amendment and would direct the money raise from fix penalty notice to public health initiative choose by the relevant local authority the liberal democrats agree with the secretary of state and the government that prevention be well than sickness and cure and that public health initiative be crucial in make those key shift in healthcare that we all hope to achieve the secretary of state hop to create smokefree generation for those bear after january but there will be exist smoker who may well wish to stop and who may need help from public health initiative or smoking cessation programme to do so the conservatives cut public health budget by quarter since mean that few people have have help to quit that be not what anybody hop to achieve through this legislation or more broadly the reform to the nhs research by university college london show that in part of england smoking rate have begin to rise again and they have be flatline as whole since between and the rate rise by in southern england and fall by in the north overall an estimate million adult in england be smoker ucl conclude that the disparity between north and south reflect the concentration of dedicated tobacco control programme in northern region and their positive impact and their relative absence in the south as the shadow minister the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson mention there be also evidence of significant black market activity in the united kingdom cessation activity have therefore become even more important to deprive the criminal gang involve of fund and to ensure that people be free of their grip give the impact of public health initiative sincerely urge the government to accept liberal democrat amendment and consequential amendment which be in line with the government objective and would improve health and save taxpayer money in the long run amendment which be also in my name be very similar to the opposition amendment it would restrict the ability of the secretary of state to unreasonably designate place as smokefree area if they do not mind say so the conservatives have be bit sloppy in draft their amendment because they have manage to remove protection in exist law for area where there be significant risk of second hand smoke in smokefree area the liberal democrats amendment have an add safeguard if the chief scientific officer that be not easy for to say advise that there be significant risk of second hand smoke an area can be designate as smokefree the amendment also retain mention of the area that the secretary of state have indicate that he will designate as smokefree include nhs premise school educational establishment and child playground the secretary of state have indicate that he will not designate other area as smokefree particularly if it would have detrimental impact on our already struggle hospitality industry and much love village pub we take he at his word on that commitment but hope that the minister can imagine future in which different secretary of state be less inclined to honour promise make by someone else at the dispatch box it be right and in good order that in that scenario parliament should get vote on the change of heart urge the government to consider this amendment carefully and ensure that the legislation match the promise make at the dispatch box new clause which have also add my name to would require the secretary of state to review and report back on the presence of contaminate vape and to find way to reduce their prevalence my hon friend the member for bath have campaign on this issue follow finding by the university of bath that one in six vape in english school contain the drug spice which can have serious side effect in child include cardiac arrest it seem reasonable that the department of health and social care and the secretary of state should try to find way of address that issue intend to push amendment and to vote to ensure that there be additional funding for public health measure very much hope that hon and right hon member will support in this common sense move to improve public health begin by declare an interest as the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on smoking and health will speak to my amendment and one or two other the tobacco and vapes bill be world lead health legislation that will create the first smokefree generation protect child and young people from the harm of smoking in the city of durham alone some child start smoke each year most of they will go on to wish that they have never start this bill will end that it will stop the start and ensure that every child have smokefree future recent datum from ucl have show that the rate of smoking be fall fast in the north east this can at least partly be attribute to hard work and amazing regional programme such as fresh which work so hard to tackle inequality in our region the same datum also show that progress be not guarantee in some area smoking rate appear to be increase the case for action be clear new clause in my name would put duty on the secretary of state to publish road map to smokefree country every five year it be labour government who introduce the first ever smoking strategy in smoking kills it be and smoking still kill this world lead bill be to be celebrate for many reason but the rise age of sale will not impact the million people who be currently smoke in the uk smoking be not spread equally across our society the most affluent be set to become smokefree this year however at the current rate the most deprive will not achieve that until it be vital that the government ensure that no one be leave behind as we create smokefree future have clear plan for achieve that and target for reduce smoking not only for the whole population but for pregnant woman those struggle with their mental health and those in occupation with high rate of smoking will save life will the minister meet the all party parliamentary group follow the publication of our report to discuss how we can turbocharge reduction in smoking and create the smokefree generation new clause table by the conservatives would require the secretary of state to publish report on the illicit market let we be clear that his majesty revenue and customs already publish annual datum with detailed analysis of the illicit market so it be difficult to see what the department of health and social care could do in addition there be no additional data source available that would yield any different result finally amendment and would remove the exemption for performer since it have be against the law to smoke inside however that do not apply to actor smoke in performance for artistic reason there be play on in london west end that tell the story of the american oil lobbyist and master strategist don pearlman don pearlman be heavy smoker who die from complication arise from lung cancer the actor play the lead role smoke on stage the exemption should be remove because actor deserve to have their health protect at work as much as everyone else audience and other actor also deserve to be protect from second hand smoke performance at the national theatre already require that smoking in performance be substitute for vaping or other alternative there be no reason why all performance should not follow suit amendment and deal with smokefree extension know that there will be further consultation and debate on the regulation create extension to smokefree place and vape free area but can the minister confirm that there will be exemption if it be show that the use of vape in certain setting aid smoke cessation effort be think of for example mental health setting the mental health and smoking partnership have point out that vape be valuable tool in such setting to help patient quit will the minister undertake to visit mental health trust to hear directly about people experience it be vital that we all work with trust to provide clear guidance on how to navigate these change particular attention must be pay to how the policy in the bill and those that will come into effect after it such as the disposable vape ban in june will interact with each other today funding announcement be welcome but we have go down to the wire give that the funding be due to end at the end of this month can we be reassure that follow the spending review service can expect consistent long term funding that will allow they to plan their activity and hire staff on long contract the bill present we with historic opportunity to transform public health in this country and after work tirelessly on it for more than decade be proud to support it however we must remain vigilant to ensure that no one be leave behind all aspect of the bill from the smoking cessation measure to protection for worker in the art must be fully realise if we be to create truly smokefree generation think you may agree madam deputy speaker that the long we spend in this job the more we realise that almost nothing be ever straightforward even the good intention nearly always have unintended consequence and there be absolutely no doubt that smoking and specifically smoke tobacco have do untold damage in my constituency and continue to do so the health of my constituent have suffer as result of the well document effect of regular smoking and moreover smoking be driver of social and economic inequality smoker earn on average less than non smoker could not believe that statistic when first read it but when think about it realise that it make complete sense those who take more time off work because of the inevitable ill health effect of smoking those who spend more of their disposable income on tobacco and those who develop dependency on drug such as nicotine will obviously experience over time an impact on their earning smoking be like an extra tax on the most disadvantaged community and can see why this government have maintain the last government ambition to phase it out agree with everything that my hon friend be say about smoking but the elephant in this room be the dramatic decline in legal tobacco sale accord to hmrc they have decline by since while the number of smoker have decline by only we be reach stage at which we be tax cigarette so heavily that we be fuel the black market and criminality and we have to be aware that as my hon friend say these be unintended consequence it be almost as if my right hon friend have read what be write next on my piece of paper be about to say that unfortunately we do not live in perfect world even our noble ambition have unintended consequence and the bill be not silver bullet there be already thriving black market for tobacco in gosport and be extremely concerned about the possibility that prohibition will exacerbate the problem be keen to hear from the minister what action she plan to take alongside the phase prohibition to provide proper resource for the police force in hampshire and the rest of the country to ensure that the law be uphold and what plan she have to take on the criminal who be already profit and who will only profit more as the age at which person can legally buy tobacco rise even without the bill smoking rate be fall across the uk as result of number of policy intervention include education smoke support and awareness campaign recently visit company in gosport that provide innovative smoking cessation support it be vape company but it have partnership with mid and south essex nhs foundation trust which signpost smoker to its store where they be give continue support to far enhance their shift away from tobacco hampshire county council have similar smokefree hampshire scheme which it say contribute to quit per year intervention such as these have prove to be successful so have the minister weigh up their merit against the possible implication of the bill want to talk mainly about new clause which have be table in my name in rare example of thing genuinely be as simple as they seem the new clause would simply ban the use of plastic filter in cigarette the debate today will largely focus on the public health benefit of ban smoking improve cancer rate for example and rightly so and have to be very clear that ban plastic filter will do absolutely nothing for public health it will however make great deal of difference to the thousand of my constituent who bathe or swim in the solent and to the marine life there over million cigarette butt be litter or drop in the gosport constituency and that figure will be replicate in every constituency across the country it be litter that we be all pay to clean up it cost local council on average about million year inevitably many cigarette butt be flush into our waterway our river and our sea in fact they account for of all litter item in the uk it be pretty grim cigarette stub can take about year to degrade in the marine environment so it be unpleasant to swim around stokes bay at the end of my road among little piece of discolour plastic the big threat though be to the environment one cigarette butt leave to soak in water for hour will release enough toxin to kill half the saltwater or freshwater fish that be expose to it and of the chemical contain in cigarette butt leachate have be find to be either toxic or very toxic to marine life there be even chance that the slow degradation of plastic butt be contribute to the rise in the microplastic increasingly find in the human body marine ecosystem such as the solent seascape which cover hectare of coastal and marine habitat include the titchfield haven in my constituency be precious we have speak at length over many year about the impact of sewage in our waterway but we now need to talk about the impact of plastic that project aim to reverse loss of biodiversity in the solent which will have all kind of benefit include tourism and nature base solution to flooding seagrass installation rely on very delicate ecosystem which include thrive fish population but leach toxin from plastic cigarette butt put those population at risk some large company have already demonstrate that it be easy to make the switch in production require to accommodate such change in the law biodegradable filter already exist it have be six year since mcdonald make decision to switch to paper straw for example but biodegradable filter unlike paper straw work and make no discernible difference to the user experience that explain why polling suggest that this measure be support by of uk adult new clause would represent huge step towards remove billion cigarette butt from our ecosystem combat the blight on our beach and street the stain in our stream and the rubbish on our road it be an environmental no brainer it be also parliamentary no brainer as it have massive public support hope the government can see the merit in support it today declare an interest as an officer of the appg on responsible vaping be ask by teenage member of my family over the christmas break what my big regret be and undoubtedly go back to the evening at an empty party for anybody unaware of the scottish parlance back in when first take draw off cigarette know all too well the addictive power of nicotine and promise when be send here by the people of falkirk in july that would do everything could to prevent another generation from be so easily expose to it sadly must say that some of the amendment propose may jeopardise that near universally support ambition in our community there be no safe way to consume nicotine and we have know for near century that smoke tobacco will in the long term be incredibly damaging to the health of person if we pass this bill and slowly but surely cut off the tobacco industry from new customer we will see low occurrence of cancer few heart attack few stroke and less illness in our community point raise by hon member about the black market be important and look forward to hear the minister response but they do not undermine my support for the generational ban in this bill for all the reason articulate do not support the various attempt in amendment to alter the generational smoking ban in committee see an attempt to alter the scope of the bill to set the age of sale at see similar attempt on the amendment paper to change the age of sale to or to scrap the generational smoking ban altogether doubt it will come as surprise to my constituent who be well aware of my leaning but for the freedom for our bairn eventually to be allow to smoke something that may ultimately kill they do not fall into the philosophical sphere of inalienable liberty say that will don the cloak of alternatively minded colleague momentarily for all but the last three day in committee be year old the shift in the age of sale propose in committee would have deprive of liberty already have and that regrettably exercise extensively in my young year deprive adult of their liberty in the name of liberty do strike as an odd argument for opponent of generational smoking ban this generational smoking ban do not deprive anyone of liberty they currently hold but shift tobacco into the category of inaccessible substance for those who never have or will have the right to begin with the liberty for our bairn to eventually be able to start smoke campaign would get short shrift from parent at the school gate of falkirk or from those sit at the bedside of love one die decade prematurely no smoker want their bairn to start smoke there be grow concern about the use of vape as tool to entice child into sexual exploitation my probe amendment new clause be prompt by police officer in derby concerned about this national issue be grateful to the minister for meet to discuss it do my hon friend agree that we must acknowledge the use of vape to groom child and ensure that licensing authority and the police work together to crack down on any retailer connect to such activity my hon friend identify an important point about the protection of young people and would be very interested to hear the minister address it in her wind up non smoker should never vape but we should acknowledge that vaping can help hell of lot of smoker to quit and that the evidence base we have on relative harm show that vaping be far less harmful than tobacco smoking the consolidation of vape into more utilitarian device use solely for the cessation of smoking be something we should pursue that necessitate measure that stop the worrying rise in young people get their hand on vape in the first place during evidence in committee trading standards articulate that online age gating have far low failure rate than sale over the counter we hear from various source about how vape be still far too easy for our bairn to get their hand on through proxy or underage counter purchase there be still work to be do to put the onus on the vaping industry to safeguard our bairn that why put my name to new clause and new clause table by my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend mary glindon they would permit the secretary of state to make regulation mandate vape retailer to sell only vape that include approve age gate technology allow adult to lock their vape and prevent bairn be able to use they that would align with and strengthen the bill objective of deter underage use by seek to extend protection away from the point of sale to the point of use will ask ministers to commit to meet and the all party parliamentary group to discuss how age gate technology and wide measure can be support in the united kingdom to strengthen the shared aim we all have to stop bairn vape the bill grant the secretary of state similar power to bring in regulation relate to the display packaging and flavour of vape on that will make few brief point the bill should not deter smoker switch to vape flavour be huge reason why smoker quit and stick by quit and we should not regulate in any way that undermine the crucial message we must get to stick with adult smoker which be that vaping have far low relative harm than continue to smoke if we can across this house acknowledge the scientific consensus that there be no non harmful consumption of tobacco the bill should be support it be time to take step that will do substantial amount to deter smoking prevent nicotine addiction and secure generation against smoking relate disease and premature death hesitate to break up the consensus ever so slightly but do disagree fundamentally with the bill in my view generational smoking ban misrepresent the proper relationship between the state and the individual and create two tier of adult member will be hearten to know that recognise the will of the house on second reading do not intend to plough on with that argument too far what have try to do with my amendment however be to genuinely improve the main aim of the bill in way that get people off smoke in the interest of public health which whether we be for or against generational ban on smoking be something that we should all support that be why be grateful to member from across this house on the government benches the liberal democrat benches and the democratic unionist benches as well as some independent member for support the measure in my name new clause and and amendment the message behind those measure be simple let we ensure less harmful vape and nicotine product get to the adult smoker who could benefit from they so that smoking rate continue to fall in that regard associate myself with some of the remark make by the hon member for falkirk euan stainbank and for city of durham mary kelly foy feel the risk of the bill be that ministers may inadvertently weaken the decline in smoking in britain somewhat as the minister and shadow minister both say in their opening remark vaping be legitimate and desirable smoking cessation tool for adult who currently smoke be grateful to my hon friend for give way and associate myself with much of what he have say already he will understand that when plain packaging be introduce just that kind of inadvertent effect be feel as those who wish to counterfeit tobacco product be able to do so at will use plain packaging that look no different from legal tobacco packaging thank my right hon friend for his remark and also associate myself with the same remark from my hon friend the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage we have to be little careful about the inadvertent effect of what might be the goodwill of all of we in this house regardless of how one see the state role in this matter we should all welcome the decrease in smoking in this country from the high of almost in the early to today we have to recognise that that be partly due to education partly to do with social stigma and partly because of legislation that this house have bring forward we should also acknowledge however the essential role that the free market have play particularly with vape and other non tobacco product in get adult smoker to stop smoke there be still million smoker in this country and none of they will come under the umbrella of the generational ban we therefore need to ensure that there be safe alternative out there for they in my view the bill as currently draft risk hang those smoker out to dry by treat vape and nicotine product although they be not include in the ban in the same way as cigarette be treat which be false equivalence that be not back by the science sit on the public bill committee realise how prevalent the view be among the public that vape and other smoking cessation tool such as non combustible tobacco be as bad as cigarette when in reality vape be at least safe than cigarette accord to public health england and dr khan independent review look at any smoking cessation website to find similar message any smoker know how difficult it be to go cold turkey and less dangerous off ramp like vape can be lifeline for those look for way out of cigarette in fact in many aspect the nhs actively promote such tool through its swap to stop scheme and have find that almost two third of people who vape alongside use stop smoke service quit smoking what concern primarily be the blanket ban approach to marketing particularly for vape and nicotine product which my new clause and would address know that many across this house have support the new clause and share those concern although totally support the need to stop disposable rainbow candy floss flavour vape be aim at child that be absolutely unacceptable adult smoker do need to know that there be safe alternative to cigarette on that concern many smoker now believe vape to be as dangerous as cigarette cancer research uk have find that of adult smoker think that vaping be just as harmful if not more harmful than smoke cigarette the risk of draconian approach to vaping as consider the bill to take will only reinforce that incorrect messaging which be damaging to public health by permit marketing in limited circumstance and under strict restriction as my new clause aim to do we can get the message to the million adult smoker that there be safe alternative out there indeed the government own impact assessment recognise the risk of the health impact of few people use vape and nicotine product to quit smoking say respectfully to the minister that this should set off alarm bell in government that be what new clause do it simply ask the government to have proper consultation on the potential impact of marketing ban dig deep than the sparse bullet point currently give to it in the impact assessment this would allow we to listen to the consumer who actively use these product and find out how these change will impact they in the public bill committee the consumer voice be largely absent restriction on flavour and packaging and vape free area be already subject to consultation and this amendment would simply bring marketing in line with that deep consideration of the impact of the marketing ban would help we maintain our progress towards smoke free and allow the government the opportunity to prevent the unintended consequence of the bill education through marketing be one of the good tool the government have at their disposal so why not wield the free market to effect real social change and let vape company do the leg work far if new clause be to be include in the bill every single non cigarette nicotine product would have to have print warning at the secretary of state discretion this could say something like strictly for adult smoker we could even use the chief medical officer own word if you do smoke do vape this would send clear message about the purpose of vape without stop they from get into the hand of smoker who could benefit from they in the bill committee many raise the issue that any advertising see by adult would inevitably be see by child that be why table amendment which would avoid this problem by permit advertising in adult only environment such as pub bar and club to that be just common sense if we know that everyone be be no good reason why advertising of these product should not be permit far we know that these night time venue be often hotspot for smoking these be the people who could benefit from tobacco free product the most if vape or nicotine pouch be advertise in this location smoker may well think twice before go to the local newsagent to buy cigarette this would work especially well if the same pub be license to sell these product on the premise urge the government through these amendment to reconsider their approach to advertising when it come to legitimate smoking cessation tool my recent write question to the department expose that either no real assessment have be do in this area of policy or it have be obscure specifically on amendment which have degree of sympathy for who would be responsible for enforce the advertisement and ensure that it be only those over the age of who be see they be assume to be honest that it would be the same people who be responsible for the licensing of alcohol advertising all my amendment speak to the principle that have outline which think be consistent with the aim of the bill and for which have receive support from across the house hope that member both in here and in the other place will recognise the value of my amendment and that the government will take these concern seriously as chair of the all party parliamentary group for responsible vaping have follow the progress of the bill closely will speak to new clause and as well to amendment and all of which stand in my name congratulate the minister on her appointment and on step up so wonderfully to help move the bill forward today youth vaping be an enormous public health challenge that form one of the government central message in the bill all of we in this place will have hear concern from teacher and parent about the prevalence of youth vaping and the challenge that school face in tackle it the bill set out to reduce the appeal of vape to child but delicate and calculated approach must be take when address youth vaping in address one problem it be incumbent on we all as legislator to not give rise to another in this case deter tobacco smoker from make the switch we still have more than million smoker to reach and vaping be safe than smoke accord to king college hospital and the former body public health england and it be the most successful tool to help smoker to quit accord to datum from action on smoking and health million adult vaper be ex smoker there be hard yard that we still have to take to reach smoker and fear that the bill at present be lose sight of what the evidence base say about the relative harm vape flavour can play significant role in passporte adult towards less harmful alternative be pleased to see in the response to write question table that the government recognise that flavour be consideration for adult smoker seek to quit the previous public health minister the hon member for gorton and denton andrew gwynne say that it be important we strike the balance between restrict vape flavour to reduce their appeal to young people whilst ensure vape remain available for adult smoker as smoking cessation tool study lead by the university of bristol last year find that flavour restriction could discourage adult from use cigarette to help they quit smoking amendment which stand in my name seek to strike balance between ban flavour descriptor which would remove flavour that deliberately appeal to child such as gummy bear and bubble gum and allow adult to use their smoking cessation product of choice stick on product requirement amendment would empower ministers to regulate the design and interoperability of product in order to prohibit the sale of very high puff count vaping device these product be typically cheap per puff contain significantly more vape liquid and plastic content than other device and have specific youth appeal in january the department for environment food and rural affairs release new guidance outline what can be consider reusable product aim to prevent the retail of vape with superficial charging and refill feature believe that this should be put on statutory footing to ensure its consistent and effective application the bill should be amend to clearly stipulate one device one tank to prevent irresponsible actor from flood the uk with these product follow the disposable ban new clause and which stand in my name would introduce requirement for retailer in england and wales to include age verification at the point of use while the bill seek to tackle youth appeal fundamental issue be leave unaddresse once vaping product leave shop there be no barrier to its be use by child but technology against this already exist meet with ike tech llc company that have develop low cost bluetooth enable chip that pair with mobile app for secure identity verification its technology also include geofencing which can disable device in certain area such as school the new clause would harness the potential that innovation have to offer to address youth vaping accessibility head on turn to advertising new clause would create limited and tightly define exemption from the new advertising restriction for in store promotional material in specialist vape shop provide that these be not externally visible and that they meet any condition around health warning set by ministers be fearful of situation where specialist tobacconist be give exemption to the restriction set out under clause to but specialist vape shop be not these vape store provide adult smoker with important advice and product consultation in their journey away from tobacco and have see that in action nicotine pouch be currently only regulate through the general product safety regulations mean that there be comparatively little regulation around these product particularly regard nicotine strength nicotine pouch with strength range from mg to mg be easily obtainable there be press need to limit the strength of nicotine to low level new clause which stand in my name would ban the manufacture and sale of pouch with more than mg per pouch this would eliminate the dangerous high strength product while maintain threshold that minimise adverse consequence arise from the restriction such as smoking and illicit pouch before make any regulation under part of the bill amendment would require the secretary of state to consult any person or body as appear to he or her representative of the interest concern instead of what be stipulate in the more limited current wording the bill provide ministers with broad power to make further regulation it be vital that these power be exercise in consultation with all relevant stakeholder include public health expert enforcement body cessation specialist retailer and industry as chair of the appg for responsible vaping hope that ministers will be willing to engage in the come month as regulation be bring forward people who do not smoke should not vape but for those who do use tobacco believe that we have duty to ensure that legislation effectively harness the power of vape as smoking cessation tool it be pleasure to follow the hon member for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend mary glindon and congratulate she on her work on vape and combat illegal sale declare my interest as the co chair of the all party parliamentary group for action on smoking and health for nine and half year have see the work that the conservative government do to combat smoking which lead to dramatic drop but we be not where we need to be commend the minister and the government on bring forward the bill and on absorb almost all the amendment that my colleague and propose in the bill committee for the previous bill to strengthen it and make it much more likely that we can achieve smokefree england by as have be say the bill will make we world leader in tobacco control we have always be at the forefront but it consolidate regulation and limit the reach of the tobacco industry we should be clear that tobacco be uniquely lethal product that when use as intend kill two third of long term user above all else it be highly addictive and hard to quit once people be addicted most smoker will say that they wish that they do not smoke and have never start and that they have have their agency remove by their addiction by pass this legislation we be give choice back to young people in the future who will avoid ever fall into that trap and the addiction that it bring have table number of new clause think that the minister be unlikely to accept they but commend they to she for further consideration new clause call on the government to consult on the introduction of polluter pay levy on the profit of the big tobacco industry the all party group have champion this campaign for many year it be support by the khan review which be set up by the former member for bromsgrove to enable position to be reach almost all its recommendation be absorb by the bill as they be by the previous bill but some be outstanding the polluter pay levy be one of they it be support by charity health organisation academic and think tank tobacco consumption cost our society greatly the late datum from action on smoking and health estimate that smoking cost society in england alone billion year far more than the billion that be raise through tobacco taxis that include billion in lose economic productivity we hear from the chancellor and the secretary of state for work and pensions about reduce the cost of the welfare state if we can stop people smoke they will not become unhealthy and unable to work they will be able to get back into the workforce and pay taxis rather than be in receipt of welfare this be an opportunity to reduce the impact on the benefit system and improve productivity right across the uk commend the hon gentleman on his excellent speech so far and his work over many year to reduce smoking prevalence in this country do he agree that the tobacco company still make huge margin on the tobacco that be sell and therefore could easily afford the polluter pay levy that he propose welcome that intervention from the vice chair of the all party group as we have say smoking be not free choice it be an addiction peddle by an aggressive industry will come to some of the thing that the hon gentleman have say polluter pay levy would achieve three thing first it would raise approximately million year that money would go to the treasury and could be use for smoke cessation service that support people to quit and indeed other health relate matter in fact all the government programme on tobacco include mass medium campaign incentive for pregnant woman and support for worker with mental health problem could be fund by that and there would still be cash to spare for other service that could go to other public health initiative to achieve the government aim of halve the gap in healthy life expectancy between the rich and poor which the minister outline early secondly it would allow the government to have great control over the market the combination of tobacco be highly addictive and four company have almost monopoly in the uk lead to severe market failure we tax tobacco quite rightly to incentivise quitting however the industry get around that because it just up the price so the cost go on the consumer rather than on the profit that these company be make when there be tax hike price on luxury brand go up even more and price be keep low on the budget one which undermine the public health objective of tobacco taxation as the hon member for city of durham mary kelly foy say the reality be that people on low income often smoke more and they will smoke the bad brand minimum excise tax be put in place to address that problem but the practice still exist so great control be need the levy model that we propose would give we the tool we need to end those practice and narrow the price gap between the most and least expensive product we would expect that in itself to bring rate of smoke down even before the revenue raise be invest in further programme finally levy of this kind would correct moral wrong it be right and fair that the tobacco industry and not the uk taxpayer should pay for the damage that it have cause to our society repeat that the model would come directly from the industry profit which far exceed the norm for consumer product as have be mention the public support the measure with of adult in great britain support levy on the tobacco industry and only opposed in the current fiscal environment we discuss that early where the government be prepared to look at more controversial way to raise revenue it be clear that they should consult on this proposal if the minister be not minded to accept this excellent idea today would she take it to the treasury and encourage participation on it new clause my second new clause would introduce ban on online sale which be not currently cover under the bill understand that that would be rather unique for the uk as there be not currently product available for sale in brick and mortar shop that can not be purchase online however we would by no mean be the first country to do so brazil mexico finland our neighbour in france and greece to name but few have all ban the sale of tobacco product via the internet ban online sale be recommend in the khan review and by the world health organisation which argue that internet sale constitute point of sale display and inherently involve advertising and promotion indeed we can look up tobacco product on any of the major supermarket website and see review such as quite nice for relax on summer day beside bubble brook perhaps or at test match that be not align with the message that we want to impart to smoker as cricket fan very much doubt that any test match ground these day would allow people to light up in any case it be important that we look to the implementation of the smokefree generation with the right support and guidance retailer will be able to implement the policy however will delivery driver for supermarket shop and deliveroo driver for example be give the same level of training and information will they be as invest in enforce the age of sale as shop owner and other worker currently online sale be not exploit by under age individual attempt to circumvent the law however we must be mindful that that may happen in the future in country that be move ever close to become smokefree should tobacco continue to be available and deliver to our door at the click of button think not although fully support the smokefree generation policy believe that it need to go far and that we need to create nicotine free future nicotine be the drug that people become addicted to the long term effect of other nicotine product such as snus and heated tobacco be just as damaging and addictive if we forbid their sale to anyone bear after they would hopefully never know what it be like to experience nicotine and would never be stick in the vicious cycle of nicotine addiction also fear that legislate only for smokefree society will leave opportunity for the tobacco industry to innovate and create new product which we know it do all the time the industry have target marketing at vulnerable people many time and there be nothing to stop it do it again in order to monopolise new market that harm people health that be why the legislation must be active and amendable to prevent reopen the bill in future year we might as well kill two bird with one stone by ensure that there be no opportunity for nicotine to continue ruin people life we may need to consider that as the bill progress through the lords to avoid duplicate what my colleague have say and what they will no doubt go on to say will not go into depth on the amendment have add my name in support of new clause and and amendment and also support the government amendment thank the government for adopt the bill from the previous conservative government have be advocate for the bill since first enter this house back in it be great that we be finally on the cusp of protect our future generation and our child child urge ministers to accept my amendment in the spirit in which table they to ensure that we cover all basis and leave no room for misinterpretation or for big tobacco to circumvent the measure commend the amendment and the bill to the house it be pleasure to follow some of the speech that we have hear so far rise to support new clause and the package of related amendment that the government have table to this landmark bill be privileged to serve on the bill committee for two reason first have the pleasure of the company of colleague from across the house albeit sometimes for more hour than one might care for on thursday evening and secondly and perhaps more importantly this legislation will undoubtedly save life on second reading talk about how the bill will deliver on our government commitment to ensure that the next generation can never legally buy cigarette create the first smokefree generation as have be say smoking be still the big cause of cancer and death tobacco be responsible for cancer case per day in the uk and cancer case annually in wales new clause and the associate grouping of amendment be welcome as the minister say the purpose of those amendment be to ensure that for example the list of identity document keep up with innovation and accommodate the possibility of digital id that be to future proof the bill as the minister say future proofing have be mention in couple of contribution today and it come up in committee too where the opposition in particular expressed concern about the power that would be delegate to ministers in order to bring into effect certain provision of the bill those power be need because we need the government of the day to be able to respond quickly and with agility to the innovation use that term sardonically of the tobacco industry in find way around the rule that we will impose on it if the bill proceed great deal of the debate have focus on vaping on which will focus the remainder of my remark although recognise the value of vaping in act as smoking cessation tool for some be it neither harmless nor some panacea as say on second reading and in committee and as colleague have say too there be much to welcome in the bill in relation to vaping the ban on the advertising of vape and measure to curb youth vaping and regulate the use of vape be example that we welcome however the reality be that as have be say vape among the youth have more than double action on smoking and health estimate that as recently as of child age to have try vape that be an example of powerful industry profit not just from cessation but from addiction marketing vaping at child by switch their conveyor belt of customer to new source indeed there be some alarming evidence that some vaper be not quit smoking but simply swap one addiction for another and many be become dual user welcome some of the contribution from colleague but we must be very much alive to those danger throughout the passage of the bill and consistent with the government work in the realm of public health since they take office vaping be regularly refer to as smoking cessation tool as have be mention and as various chief medical officer from all our home nation have say if someone smoke vaping be much safe although accept that vaping be helpful tool in the fight for well public health it be regrettable that we do not have for vape the wealth of evidence over decade that underpin tobacco and the deadly consequence of smoking we must therefore be clear on this if someone do not smoke they should not vape vaping be not harmless it be just less harmful than smoke tobacco public health policy must be base on evidence and not on spin from the industry indeed the power of big tobacco have be expand on by colleague my hon friend be make an excellent speech particularly like the way he sum up the inherent risk of vaping and his explanation that vaping could be helpful to people who wish to give up but that at the same time there be real threat to people who have never smoke or vape do he agree that this matter need to be see in the wide context of issue at secondary and even primary school and of difference in public health outcome across community with need to focus resource on particular community whether child or other to try to help completely agree with my hon friend trust the minister will expand on that when she come to wind up the debate as say public health policy must be base on evidence and not just spin or perception so move forward urge the government to ensure that as part of their work to implement the legislation as well as promote vaping as smoking cessation tool they must also undertake work to research the consequence of vape on both the physical and mental health of the individual its financial impact and as be say any regional and national inequality that have become entrench by vape when she come back to this matter in her wind up will the minister also assure that in so do she will work with the four home nation to ensure that that data be as thorough as possible if that research show as have no doubt it will that vaping be significantly damaging to the nation health perhaps less so than smoking but none the less still significantly damaging we must act to curb it we can not afford to wait decade and decade for that truth to come out in the way that it take decade for big tobacco to be find out would be grateful if the minister could provide some reassurance on that point in conclusion be proud to support this legislation as have be say there be no liberty in addiction and there be no freedom in be victim to craving that kill the bill take an unprecedented step forward to curb that damage and urge colleague from across the house to support it must declare an interest be co founder of action on world health have to say find the tone of moral superiority in the chamber this afternoon almost unbearable member clearly believe they be well human being than those outside who choose to pursue activity that member perhaps would not pursue it would come as bit of shock suppose to some in this chamber but there be some of we who like smoke we do we even go for few pint in pub we have punt on the horse and be even tempt to have the odd doughnut know that be perhaps the naughty of all we want to have fun we want to make our own mind up this place can educate we tell we give we the fact but the idea that it should make those decision for other people show that the spirit of oliver cromwell be alive and well do the hon gentleman agree that responsible government should seek to improve public health particularly the public health of the young generation it be quite possible that sugar should be ban so yes agree it be possible but do not think that be what the government be here to do the government can educate individual should make up their own mind some of the nonsense have hear this afternoon have be quite extraordinary smokefree generation we even have the hon member for harrow east bob blackman suggest we would be smokefree by to begin with the idea that nobody bear after could buy the tobacco product that those bear before then could be just another aspect of two tier britain and not single member not one despite the fact that we be discuss nicotine and tobacco product so far have mention drug oh no let forget about that because drug be illegal already and we can not do anything about they have be hear for decade that there will be war on drug where be it get we drug use be rocket and class drug in particular with all the associated crime be proliferate everywhere here be the danger believe it or not an ounce of tobacco be now more expensive if purchase legally in shop than an ounce of silver so already we have rocket trade in illegal cigarette and loose tobacco if we carry on down this route with age band and so on we will find ourselves in the position that australia have stupidly put itself in by over tax tobacco and make it very difficult to smoke there have be fire bombing of premise in melbourne alone in the last two year do not drive tobacco into the hand of the criminal do not create new black market totally agree with the minister this be not an activity that we should encourage we be not keen for our kid to smoke but please treat we as grow up educate we let we make our choice do not let the criminal win first should say thank you to the minister for present this afternoon and for allow to be on the tobacco and vapes bill committee which be incredibly interesting there be differ view and there be robust conversation it be always good to listen to different view but overall the bill generally have cross party support as conservative members have point out many member of their party have be campaign for this bill for long time be public health consultant train for to year to be one and the precondition for public health policy be datum and evidence opinion be interesting they can add great colour and character to conversation but datum and evidence will ultimately deliver well population health outcome this public health bill will stop people die and will take away addiction to substance an addiction that be not choice for many year there have be public health conversation about whether we should impose measure this conversation be not new wonder how many of we in the house feel strongly these day about wear seatbelt but we do not have to go too far back to find time when people really object to be tell to wear seatbelt tobacco be undoubtedly still the lead cause of premature death and disability in the united kingdom as have be mention by my hon friend every day around people be diagnose with cancer cause by smoking and smoking cause at least different type of cancer will talk primarily about new clause propose by my hon friend the member for city of durham mary kelly foy the bill will do outstanding work to enable smokefree generation but we also need to continue to tackle health inequality for exist smoker smoking be harmful and difference in smoke prevalence across the population translate into major difference in death rate and illness we in this place come together from across the country and represent different constituency we want the good health outcome among many other thing for our resident it be therefore incumbent on we to look at inequality and where they reside and to legislate against they where possible smoking be the single large driver of health inequality in england it be far more common among people with low income and be happy to discuss with any member why that be the more disadvantaged someone be the more likely they be to smoke to suffer from smoking relate disease and to suffer premature death smoking relate health inequality be not relate solely to socioeconomic status we represent different part of the united kingdom the poor health of people in the north of england be in part due to high rate of smoke there smoking rate be also high among people with mental health condition people in contact with the criminal justice system look after child and lgbt people we all have different type of people in our constituency and we should be mindful of those inequality and the need to address they health inequality will be reduce through measure that have great effect on smoker in high prevalence group in practice that mean prioritise population level intervention that disadvantaged smoker be more sensitive to and target intervention on those smoker have run smoking cessation service during my time as public health consultant can absolutely say that it be incredibly difficult for anybody to give up smoking we have member who have succeed and who be perhaps still try to give up to give up smoking person need to be in place where they have the mental resilience and can put time and energy into quit if they be fight all the other issue that come with the burden of be poor if they be fight for employment or try to feed their child it be so much hard my hon friend have propose road map to smokefree country and report to this place every five year be not particularly wed to that but we should be laser focused on reduce health inequality across all population therefore hope that our government will consider have reporting process similar to the one in new clause among the change to the national health service in the health and social care committee this morning we be talk about where the office for health improvement and disparities will go follow the dissolution of nhs england this be an ongoing conversation that we need to be mindful of we need to ensure that the ongoing importance of address health disparity be not lose and think that be front and centre of the secretary of state agenda in the year plan on behalf of public health consultant and professional commend the bill to the house and be proud to be part of government and parliament that will bring this life change piece of legislation to the country want to speak to amendment and the subsequent amendment in my name and to new clause it be right that where public health issue be identify this body should look at whether anything can be do about it through law fiscal policy or the other lever available to we but we should ask ourselves when we introduce law what the consequence be be there any unintended consequence and how practical and enforceable be the measure if they be unenforceable all we do be bring the law and this place into disrepute while some have describe this bill as well mean essential flagship bill and show of leadership be concerned that we have give little thought to and have little debate about the consequence which be hit we in the face let we be honest with ourselves it would be good to walk away at the end of today sit and say we have do wonderful thing for future generation we have introduce law that will do away with smoking and will improve the health of the nation but we be ignore the fact that we have introduce legislation that be unworkable and to which believe through my amendment there be an alternative do the right hon gentleman recall that many warn before the smoking ban that it would be unenforceable and that there would be barely any compliance with it however from day one there be compliance that law have help to drive reduction in cancer due to secondary smoking and massive number of people give up as result of no long be able to smoke in the pub the hon member will have the answer to that if he reflect on what we be debate today we introduce that legislation yet here we be revisit the issue because people be still smoke and health outcome be still bad and we have additional problem which will come to in moment namely the illegal purchase and supply of tobacco we have try this in the past we have try ban and all kind of other measure yet we still have the problem with we let we consider the consequence first we be be ask to introduce legislation the burden of which will fall on retailer because it be at the point of purchase that the scrutiny require by the bill and its implementation will have to take place there be question that we have not debate yet what happen when retailer be face in few year time with two people one aged and the other both demand tobacco one say and the other say as well the retailer be mean to distinguish which of they he can sell tobacco to legally that be real practical problem and it place burden on the retailer because if he do not make the right decision he face fine and the removal of his license and that source of income for his business will be affect agree about the practicality of need to pick between two adult of similar age in shop do the right hon gentleman agree that the person sell the cigarette will probably be shop lad age or he will have to draw distinction between adult much old than he we should consider the position that put that young gentleman in that be the next point be go to come to the hon gentleman anticipate what be go to say we will place burden not just on the retailer but on those who work in the retailer store we be concerned about assault on retail staff we have take legislation on the subject through the house the evidence from the british retail consortium be that many of those assault take place when good be deny to individual because they can not offer identification and show their age so we be place retailer and those who work in shop in great danger there may be safeguard against that in some of the big store that have security guard but many of the shop that sell tobacco be small corner retailer that do not have security guard or even anyone in the shop other than the shopkeeper or the person behind the counter yet we be demand that they implement the legislation regardless of how practical or impractical it be for individual to make distinction between somebody who be and somebody who be or whatever the right hon member might be forgive for think that we be start from zero sum game but we already have restriction as people must be to purchase cigarette and vape shop worker be already challenge customer on their age so the regulation do not come from nowhere secondly if you read the bill you would know that there be date specify that would be very clear on identification order intervention should be short and the term you refer to in the chair it be easy to distinguish between year old and year old usually the young the age the easy it be to make that determination but it be much more difficult when people be old yet that distinction will have to be make the idea may be that the cost of the licence will be so expensive that many small retailer will be squeeze out of the market and the only outlet will be big store where there be security guard however the sale of tobacco provide an important part of the income of many small retailer whether we like it or not we be put burden on people who will find that they be expose to danger and difficulty and will be subject to the law if they make the wrong decision the second issue which have be touch on today be what happen when people can not get the tobacco that they want where do they go they go to people who be prepared to sell it to they illegally we can not run away from the fact that the sale of illegal tobacco be already lucrative especially because of the tax increase that we have introduce it be lucrative for criminal gang and it fund many of their activity we have hear statistic that of cigarette and of roll tobacco be already sell by criminal gang in northern ireland it be probably far high because paramilitary be involve in the trade and use it to fund their activity for so long if anybody think oh well we deal with that problem when it come look at the history of northern ireland where hundred of million of pound find its way into the coffer of terror gang and action be not take because it be sometimes too hard or too difficult to trace the thing yes action have now be take but do not think that we be go to have an all out assault on the booming industry that this legislation will produce my last point about the bill be impractical be that it can not apply in northern ireland because as part of the eu single market we be under the tobacco product directive the irish republic try to introduce similar legislation and find that it could not because of that directive that be why we have table new clause challenge the government to amend the windsor framework so that the legislation will apply across the united kingdom this be not counsel of despair because believe that there be an alternative as set out in the amendment indeed the government own modelling suggest that much more practical way be to set the age limit at if the figure and the modelling be correct although there be question about the tobacco modelling on do away with smoking in generation and if we impose the age limit of which avoid some of the problem we have talk about with the sale of tobacco we reach zero consumption by just as we do with the generational model that avoid many of the problem and difficulty have outline and the consequence for retailer rather than rush into this it be headline grab measure but it have not work elsewhere why do new zealand drop it because of the booming market in illegal tobacco believe that in number of year we will find that we make the same mistake for the tobacco and vapes bill be landmark opportunity to improve health outcome for people in my constituency of kilmarnock and loudoun as well as people across the whole united kingdom almost people die each year from smoking relate illness and many of my constituent have tell they wish that they have never start smoke in the first place with this bill we draw line under the public health tragedy that tobacco have cause over too many decade on top of the tragedy of death every year smoking cost the nhs more than billion and see our economy lose more than billion in productivity this bill be the bold action that our country need and that my constituent in kilmarnock and loudoun will benefit from be proud that this labour government be stand up to the tobacco lobby with the banning of tobacco product for anyone bear in or after that radical change will save life in my constituency have see people as young as puffing on vape on their way to school and when return home that be huge concern for the health and wellbeing of those young people and the ease of access that they have to vape be simply unacceptable my hon friend be make an excellent speech she refer to the risk that young people will increasingly use vape do she agree that the ban on advertising vape can not come quickly enough in my constituency of rugby see shop that look like sweet shop and whose name sound like sweet shop that be clearly design to encourage and frankly entice young people to take up this unpleasant habit absolutely agree with my hon friend on those point while some argue that vape may be less harmful than smoke tobacco product our new generation should not be encourage to become dependent on the addictive effect of nicotine this bill do exactly the right thing in give the secretary of state the power to ban flavour vape that be very obviously market to child and young people research the flavour on offer find cola gummie flavour pink lemonade flavour strawberry chew flavour and tropic bubblegum flavour to name just few can anyone really claim that those flavour and the countless other on offer be not aim at child many member from both side of the house would raise more than an eyebrow at that claim this bill will regulate the wild west of vaping which we have see expand on our high street over the last decade it will also address the issue of poor quality vape which be safety concern include single use vape and end the scourge of these product litter our street and community as someone with background of year in the nhs know the difference that this bill will make it will save life and help to save our environment and will be proud to vote for it in our post spiritual or at least post religious age two phenomenon be evident when god be forget and faith decline people do not believe in nothing but as chesterton say they believe in anything they find new cause and crusade and know the advocate of this bill believe that they be crusade in noble cause the second thing that occur be that as demon be regard as purely mythical entity thing that be once regard as normal and regular become demonised the curious paradox be that while cocaine be widely available and be tell de rigueur among certain element of the urban liberal elite pipe smoker be now see as heretic be that not so alarming it would be the subject of comic satire that be the kind of world we live in we be simultaneously become more prurient and more puritanical the amendment that stand in my name and those of other hon and right hon gentleman be design to improve the bill to avoid unintended consequence the hon member for worthe west dr cooper say think be quote she accurately that we need datum and evidence what be clear from the datum and evidence be that previous attempt to deal with the issue of smoking have result in huge surge in illegal tobacco some of smoker report purchase tobacco not subject to uk tax in that number have increase hugely since that early legislation three quarter of smoker claim to buy tobacco not subject to uk tax from under the counter supplier who have become legion in constituency such as mine and be sure in small town across the whole of the country those be the unintended consequence of well mean crusader who think they be do noble thing when they pass legislation in this house that be the datum those be the fact will the right hon member give way will give way as have cite the hon lady how could do anything other thank the right hon gentleman for give way be he make the argument that we should not address population health issue population health intervention have see reduction in smoking and reduction in health relate damage from smoking because of the consequence of illegal tobacco those issue do need to be address but be he say that we should keep it legal and therefore not see reduction what be say to the hon lady be that the government and the previous government should have do the same need to take concerted and decisive action to deal with the unintended consequence of well mean legislation that lead to huge growth in the illegal sale of tobacco and cigarette rather than introduce rolling age of consent which by the way be entirely unenforceable they ought to target their effort draw on their resource and seek the almost limitless expertise that be available to government to deal with an issue that frankly be go largely unrestricted good work be be do by trading standard in my constituency in lincolnshire and by local police but they struggle because the legislation be inadequate would have support bill have it come to the house will not digress too much madam deputy speaker because you will not allow to do so that license the sale of tobacco most tobacconist and most newsagent suspect would welcome that measure know that police would like to see that kind of measure which be rather like what we do with alcohol there be precedent there but that be not what be before we today on the rolling age of consent the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson who have table amendment be right that it can not be enforce be in favour by the way of raise the age of consent to be honest be in favour of raise the age of consent to for virtually everything that could be enforce although it would not be straightforward but the idea that someone will go into tobacconist or newsagent and say be and the tobacconist will say actually think you could be or in year to come be and the tobacconist or newsagent will say no no think you could be be nonsense it be never go to happen no retailer be go to do that either the bill will fail think the law would be break daily or we will devote undue resource to police something that frankly do not warrant such attention let we recognise that this be preposterous proposal as the right hon member for east antrim say by and large we should not do thing in this house that be preposterous rise will give way to the hon gentleman who be go to tell why we should be retail and hospitality worker myself in scotland and we apply check regularly would the simple question not be be you bear before or after january be that complex question would appreciate an explanation of how it be tell you there be two thing about this legislation order tell you sir john hayes you should know well than that say two say that there be two thing about this legislation think it be you but no matter time be short well let rephrase it tell you madam deputy speaker that there be two thing about this legislation have get it right now and the first be its core objective and the second be the mean by which that objective be meet be at the moment talk about the mean by which it be meet and will say little more about that when address some of the amendment in my name and those of other member when we pass measure in this house when we make law we should concentrate on both their purpose and their effect if we do not do that we be not do our job as lawmaker my concern about the bill be that the effect will be compromise by the mean regardless of its purpose entirely endorse what be say by my hon friend the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage about plastic filter think that her new clause would be helpful addition to the bill and should be amazed if the minister do not embrace and adopt it perhaps it could be table as government amendment but we may vote on it later be sure that the government whips will want to whip their member to support it because it be environmentally right terribly sensible and entirely deliverable it would oblige the industry to do the right thing and create filter that be biodegradable and which as we hear early be produce in immense number have mention amendment in the name of the right hon member for east antrim which deal with this nonsense of the rolling age of consent it be straightforward amendment that propose that the age of consent should be considerable increase on where we be now and that retailer must observe that the hon member for falkirk euan stainbank say that the matter be already be deal with because there be already an age of consent yes there be one age of consent but not series of age of consent with the need to assess people age presumably by some formal mean perhaps they will have to take their passport with they every time they go to the newsagent to buy their paper and their ounce of golden virginia or whatever else rise will give way to the hon gentleman who think ask terribly weak question during prime minister question time early today let we see whether he can do well now it be not very pleasant of the right hon gentleman to say that but thank he for let intervene regard the age of consent and the amendment call for it to be raise to do he not accept that the tobacco industry would merely target its immense marketing power on those who be over and that that that could have very bad effect on public health the key thing about tobacco as the hon member for worthe west the expert on public health who be sit next to the hon gentleman will no doubt confirm be that people tend to acquire the habit early and as the hon lady say can not break it not many people be non smoker at and become smoker at the vast majority of smoker acquire the habit early in their life my father probably start smoke at he give up overnight when he be because the price of golden virginia go up say to he do you feel any well and he reply do feel ill when smoke and do feel ill that be another matter this issue really relate to young people and child in particular and that bring to vape support much of what be in the bill about they school have an immense problem with vaping headteachers and teacher tell that it be something that they have to be religious in scrutinise because these thing can find their way into school so easily in someone bag for instance rather as with mobile phone we must enforce ban on vape in school with rigour think that the measure be introduce in the bill will reinforce that so share the government ambition in that respect on new clause which stand in my name again find it hard to believe that the government will not accept it willingly because it simply say that we should review how effective the legislation be it be probably true that every bill we debate ought to have something like this attach to it because it be good idea once bill have be publish debate consider and pass into law that it should be regularly review in such way understand that the mover of this bill its advocate and its enthusiast believe that they be do the right thing and be not unsympathetic to some of their ambition do sometimes often indeed wish that this house be colour by common sense as liberally as it be pepper with piety none the less let be generous and say that know that the minister and other feel that they be do something noble however it be absolutely right when we legislate in this house that we do so with the great care with clear and desirable purpose of the kind mention moment or two ago appropriate mean and measurable effect will the right hon member give way be move to my thrilling peroration but will hesitate for moment or two thank the right hon member for give way and can not express just how pleased be that he have child make up one in five of our population but routinely get ignore so it be no wonder that playground after playground get close if child be able to make their way into playground they be now subject to second hand smoke because to date there be no law to stop that do he agree with that one of the great thing about this bill be that we be go to protect child against second hand smoke and make sure that their health be well as result agree that it would be well if child be able to avoid either first hand or second hand smoke we have to stop young people themselves smoke sadly too many people do smoke too young rightly as the hon gentleman say we need to prevent their being affect by the smoking of other so what he say be of course perfectly reasonable will repeat my pre peroration briefly have say that the legislation we pass should have clear and desirable purpose appropriate mean and measurable effect in other word we need to do the right thing by the right mean for the right reason law that be unenforceable be not only undesirable they do we as legislator no favour for they undermine popular faith in what we do and in who we be much of this law be unenforceable for the reason have give parliament history be litter with unforeseen consequence foresee and hope other might too that with the improvement the amendment would bring to this bill we can avoid some of the bad of those unforeseen consequence rise order apologise to all member but we will now have speak limit of five minute appreciate that you want to guillotine speech to five minute madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to speak on the bill and as member of the public bill committee to see it come before the house welcome the contribution of member across the house and the quality of the scrutiny we see in the public bill committee also want to reflect on the year of campaigning and service undertake by ministers and shadow ministers that have bring we to this place and on the advocacy in broadcast and on the news of people who be smoker but who say that they never should have start also welcome the view of young people in my constituency who when speak to at school and college have tell how vape be become more pernicious and more commonplace in their life will speak to government new clause and new clause on age verification and the rise escalator and will challenge some of the point make about enforcement will also talk to new clause on education and road map to smokefree generation and to new clause which set annualise reporting on nicotine base product will also challenge some of the opposition misconception about trading standard and the regulatory landscape the bill be forward think and respond to an issue but it build on previous legislation over many year and good practice in other place and other country to regulate and reduce smoking we know that noble crusader on public health have in the past take action to clean our air clean our water and introduce seatbelt restriction and food standard we know that public health measure work smoking be the large preventable cause of illness and premature death in the united kingdom kill about people year it be estimate to cost billion to the nhs and furth billion in cost every year with smoker five time more likely to need social care support at home the annual economic productivity loss add up to billion not only be there an ethical and social motivation behind the bill there be an economic one as well age verification be topic of debate in committee welcome government new clause and new clause on age verification government new clause introduce digital identification and link in with government legislation to introduce digital id over the next five year this be absolutely enforceable in many off licence and supermarket today age challenge happen at bespoke counter individual under the age of who try to purchase vape or tobacco base product be challenge on their age all the bill will do be introduce fix date which can then be assess use any form of digital id it be no more onerous than what be currently happen but it will require training and transition period challenge the comment make by some oppose the measure that it be somehow unenforceable we already enforce age restriction on the sale of product it already happen the hon gentleman will have read my new clause which ask for review it would be really good to look at whether the measure can work in the way he say hope he might support my new clause just on that basis let we take it at face value if it work it work if it do it do thank the right hon gentleman for his contribution want to take he back to his speech when he say that he would consider an increase in age to or my concern be that that would introduce two tier adult status if we increase the age from to overnight there will be adult who previously could smoke who will then be ban from smoke for three year do not accept the premise that we should have two tier adult which be why believe in stag increase in smoking cessation on new clause support the government ambition to reduce smoking and want to make it absolutely clear that this measure be part of global standard to reduce smoking around the world the bill be pioneer and urge member to support it on second reading the government say that this be four nation bill on the face of it it be but the legal reality be that it be not the provision applicable to northern ireland be inevitably destine to be strike down by the high court because of northern ireland subjugation under the protocol or windsor framework to eu law the specific eu law that northern ireland be subject to relevant to this bill be the tobacco directive accord to that directive state can not limit the placing on the market of tobacco product that cause the government of two country within the eu the government of denmark and the irish republic to withdraw proposal while acknowledge that they want to do what this house be do but could not do so because it would breach the tobacco directive to it be an appalling vista that this so call sovereign parliament of the united kingdom can produce bill that on its face apply to all part of the united kingdom but because of parliament that we do not elect decree superior piece of legislation in so far as northern ireland be concern because we be alas subject to its rule the proposal will as far as my constituent be concern be stillborn that be quite an appalling situation the legal recommendation have be quite clear that be why draft new clause which would provide route to allow this bill to apply in northern ireland it would do so by exempt the tobacco directive from pass through the conduit that deliver eu law to northern ireland namely section of the european union withdrawal act northern ireland be govern under these pernicious eu law through annex of the windsor framework which set out law that will continue to apply to northern ireland one of those law be the tobacco directive along with the other eu law the directive be through section apply as superior law in northern ireland law law that this sovereign parliament can not disapply that be why in new clause have provide the government with the opportunity to amend section so as to exempt the tobacco directive application in northern ireland say to the government that although they have not accept this new clause there be still time to do so in the other place and that there be no point in simply repeat an assurance as on second reading that they be confident that the legislation will apply the same government lawyer advise the previous government that the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act and the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act would apply in northern ireland when those piece of legislation hit the buffer in the high court it be because northern ireland on those two issue be subject to the superiority of eu law under which the court rule this be an even clear situation the tobacco directive which say that state can not ban the sale of product be set out expressly in annex to the windsor framework as the superior applicable law it be therefore even clear that this legislation will be unable to apply in northern ireland my challenge to the government be the following there will no doubt be challenge in the high court from the tobacco industry with its vested interest if it turn out that these provision be strike down in northern ireland will the government tonight at least commit to override that in future legislation rise today in support of this legislation young people vape be not the big issue that come up in surgery but it be one of the big issue that come up when walk through town or visit school and even when talk to young people themselves it be an urgent crisis not just vape but smoking there be around cancer death in the area around stafford eccleshall and the village every year and datum suggest that in the next five year more than of my constituent will have have lung cancer relate issue this legislation show that this labour government care about the child of this country we care about who they be and who they will become we want they to live long be happy and never have the chance to pick up vape or cheap pack of tobacco that could set they on the path of addiction for the rest of their life wish to take moment to acknowledge the former prime minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak for start version of this bill and bring it forward despite significant opposition in his own party know that he do it out of concern for the future of the child of this country and commend he for it today some will talk about choice when they oppose this bill in my work as an mp have speak to people whose life have be devastate by this addiction ask whether those who speak about choice truly believe that once addiction have take hold person have the same freedom of choice that they once do this be not about take choice away it be about give people freedom from addiction before it ever appear for the bill be also about something so much deep it be about time time with family and time with friend how many of we have lose love one to cancer lose my grandfather to cancer and my mum have have lung cancer my mum be entirely fit at the time she be diagnose with lung cancer she use to do joe wicks workout every morning as she come from place in the north where people suffer from lung relate illness she be part of pilot scheme to scan smoker and previous smoker for issue her cancer be catch early while she have no symptom my family know how lucky we be we be lucky that the cancer which would have continue to grow in her body be catch then and there in fact the cancer be so small that after it be take away she need no further treatment just lobe of her lung be remove my family could not be more grateful that she be part of that scheme that she be still do joe wicks exercise in the morning and that she be still around to play with her grandchild how many more precious moment with family will this bill provide that be the only question that be here to answer truly the child of the future may never know how their life be change by this bill just as do not really know how my life be change by the seatbelt bill introduce year before be bear because they will never have pick up the smoking habit in the first place they will live long live healthy and have more time with the people whom they love let this be the generation that end youth addiction before it begin echo the word of the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister with regard to the importance of this bill apply to all four nation want it to cover the entirety of the united kingdom some people in northern ireland die every year from smoking relate illness one in four of our cancer case be relate to smoking the consultation carry out by the previous government on their legislation which be specifically about create smokefree generation find that of the uk population be supportive in northern ireland however be in favour of bring forward this legislation back in may when be northern ireland health minister introduce the original legislative consent motion which receive all party support across the northern ireland assembly and yes as the hon and learn member for north antrim have mention there be concern over the applicability of the measure owe to eu regulation and legislation there be concern that the law would remain undelivered in northern ireland at that stage engage with the then uk government and have now engage with this government to seek assurance that this lifesaving life change legislation will apply equally and favourably to all part of our united kingdom look forward to the minister be able to give those reassurance have sign new clause because accept those reassurance as health minister but would appreciate reinforcement in this legislation much have be say about the entrapment of our young people whether previously with regard to tobacco or now with vaping and vaping product and how they be be market and present one of the most harrowing report that have read recently be regard alder hey child hospital which have now open clinic for child addict to nicotine they become hooked because of vaping twelve child between the age of and have have to seek medical help to cut down and deal with their nicotine addiction twelve child between the age of and be receive treatment in child hospital due to the evil promotion and enhancement of not just vaping but nicotine we be look to save money within our national health service but we be already encourage and enable these young people to become addicted to dangerous drug we should be do everything we can in this place for young people accord to report about the alder hey clinic child as young as eight be vape regularly some reportedly can not get out of bed in the morning before they take their first puff that be disgrace encourage anyone in this chamber who in any way oppose the bill or think that this be not the right thing to do to seriously consider how vaping be impact our young people across this united kingdom finish by ask the minister to reassure this house not just with word but with action can she assure those of we from northern ireland who have support the legislation and work hard to make sure that it have four nation approach that the guidance support and legal enforcement in the bill be equally applicable to we in northern ireland rise to speak to new clause and amendment and declare an interest as vice chair of the all party parliamentary group on smoking and health be also previous smoker and strong supporter of this legislation new clause would introduce ban on all filter regardless of whether they contain plastic understand the environmental motivation behind new clause from the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage but worry that the amendment be not sufficient to address environmental concern and could even have damaging impact on public health let we start from the understanding that there be no health benefit to filter they be develop by the tobacco industry follow evidence that smoking cause lung cancer in order to give false sense of reassurance to smoker filter have be dub the deadly fraud in the history of human civilisation most filter contain single use plastic and be major environmental hazard cost uk local authority around million year to clean up cigarette filter be the most littered item in the world in the uk they make up of all litter item biodegradable alternative may therefore feel like an attractive solution but biodegradable filter do not eliminate environmental concern they have be show to be equally toxic to marine and freshwater life when litter in our river and sea they take between two and year to decompose and they often do so only in very particular condition such as under high temperature biodegradable filter could also lead to an increase in guilt free litter through smoker believe that discard butt do not have an environmental impact however the great risk of biodegradable filter be that they allow tobacco company to continue with filter fraud and greenwashe in order to rehabilitate their reputation the good policy therefore be to ban all filter it would mean smoker smoke filterless cigarette which remind the house be no bad for their health it would incentivise quitting which be the good way to tackle tobacco relate litter and pollution and it would put people off start smoking something of which be sure everyone in this chamber would be in favour end the sale of filter would remove the fraud be perpetrate on smoker that by use filter they be protect their health we ban descriptor such as light and mild because they give false comfort to smoker that they be use safe product and inhibit they quit we should do the same again by ban filter ensure that those who smoke do not do so because of belief that their cigarette be safe recent ash polling show that only of the public be able to correctly identify that filter have no health benefit the government should be bold in address these misconception for the benefit of public health and take the opportunity of ban to highlight the harm of tobacco ban on filter be an opportunity to protect the environment and secure health benefit the impact of any ban should be maximise by strong communication campaign to educate smoker and the wide public about filter fraud briefly amendment and flag the need for the government to consider the matter of the sale of bundle of tobacco paper and filter which could be see as smoke starter kit some supermarket offer these bundle at only small cost above the price of the tobacco alone they be convenient and cost saving for smoker that undermine the public health motivation for increase the price of tobacco product reiterate my full support for this legislation and how important it be that we stop the start and bring about smokefree generation commend the work of action on smoking and health in support and shape an excellent bill that will be great law rise to speak to new clause in my name it would strengthen the bill by require the secretary of state to conduct review and publish report on the impact of contaminate liquid and way to reduce its prevalence it would also give the secretary of state power to make regulation to kerb the harm cause by contaminate liquid have be campaign on the issue of spice spike vape ever since it come to my attention last summer the bill be an opportunity to make real change on this hugely concern problem that be sweep through school across the country new clause would improve our understanding of contaminate liquid and ensure that the necessary regulation could be introduce to reduce the harm that it cause the issue be first uncover by professor chris pudney at the university of bath who find that one in six vape confiscate in school contain the synthetic drug spice spice be dangerous prison drug that cause serious harm to user include hallucination dizziness chest pain breathe difficulty and damage to vital organ the highly addictive nature of spice make it gateway to criminal activity coercion and abuse it be tragic that anyone would take this drug but it be especially tragic when young people do who be often unaware of the danger many young people inadvertently smoke spice under the impression that it be cannabis worryingly recent investigation have find that vape be be contaminate with not just spice but ketamine and mdma which be particularly harmful when take in high dos the landscape of contaminate liquid be evolve rapidly and it be likely that this issue will worsen if the bill pass unamended an unintended consequence of ban disposable vape be that it will drive more user towards refillable vape which be the primary vehicle for contaminate liquid refillable vape be more susceptible to be spike with harmful substance than disposable vape this shift could exacerbate an already significant public health threat make it even hard to control the spread of dangerous substance in the market welcome the ban on disposable vape but we must take action to safeguard against these unintended consequence the metropolitan police have warn about child access illicit vape through social medium platform such as snapchat and telegram there be clearly link between social medium drive drug dealing and the rise of vaping in school the ease of access to vape and their widespread use make they even more difficult to regulate and make it difficult to protect individual from unknowingly consume illicit substance there be lack of knowledge and oversight and counterfeit or illicit vape product be slip through the crack exacerbate the already alarming rise in drug relate incident there be much more to understand about how illicit vape and liquid be obtain new clause would set we on our way it would ensure that we build on the research of professor pudney at the university of bath by conduct review of the impact and prevalence of these illicit liquid have have several conversation with ministers about this issue first in response to my adjournment debate the minister for policing fire and crime prevention commit to address the issue through the bill also meet the former public health minister who assure that the government and health official be take the issue very seriously appreciate that minister want to make change in this area urge they please to follow through and make this change by support new clause as have little time note new clause in the name of the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar which would require the government to report on the availability of illegal tobacco and vaping product this be serious problem to which attention be rightfully be bring support that addition to the bill but the new clause do not quite get to the heart of the issue that be focus on new clause call for specific review of contaminate liquid and way to reduce its prevalence and give the secretary of state power to make regulation to combat the harm that contaminate liquid cause welcome the amendment to the bill this be now strengthened piece of legislation that will create the first smokefree generation the chronic health issue that stem from smoking and their impact on our nhs be well know the bill the amendment and what they will go on to achieve will be critical in support the nhs and improve health outcome smoking cost the economy and wide society more than billion year include cost of billion to the nhs and social care that be equivalent to the annual salary of almost nurse or gps and be the cost of more than million gp appointment while the bill will create the first smokefree generation the government recognise that we need to do more to help people quit smoking that be why be so glad to welcome the additional funding announce in december to support local authority lead stop smoke service suffolk be allocate an additional for this year which mean that people in suffolk coastal will be able to access support and live healthy smokefree life know from personal experience just how hard that be on the very day of the bill second reading in november give up smoking because have just vote on bill that would mean that my niece and nephew would never legally be able to smoke have try to give up smoking before the last time be just before the general election when in truth never stand chance of succeed but be able to succeed this time only because have move to vape to quote something that have already be say if you smoke vape if you do smoke do vape it be simple and true speak on second reading about the important role that the bill will play in prevent young people from take up vaping the dramatic rise in child take up vaping should be nationally recognise as one of the most concern crisis face young people and child the bill will make it hard for young people to be draw into vaping and will bring the law on vape advertising in line with that for tobacco advertising there will be total ban on vape advertising and sponsorship there will also be consultation on the vape flavour that we all know be far too appealing to child however we need to do more as stand here deliver this contribution new product be appear on the market that seek to exploit the loophole in the upcoming ban on single use vape understand that the bill explicitly give the secretary of state power to regulate far to limit the size of vape and to ban the so call big puff vape which provide more than puff per pod since second reading we have see product come on to the market that allow people to attach refillable ml pod create in effect puff vape that be not big puff vape it be colossal puff vape the hon lady be talk about refillable vape do she agree that contaminate refill be huge problem and that the government should take that seriously and amend the bill far thank the hon lady for her intervention we have hear that point make articulately and not just by she look forward to the minister response to that the issue of the puff vape and the addition that can be make to vape be why table new clause which build on theme that have be speak about in the chamber this afternoon welcome the power in the bill for the secretary of state to regulate far to standardise the size of reusable vape but my new clause would allow we to limit their size soon and prevent rogue vape manufacturer from circumvent the rule while the secretary of state undertake further consultation on such measure though the bill provide the power to standardise vape be ask the government to legislate now to standardise and regulate puff per vape so that we do not see an explosion of new vape in the marketplace that be try to get around the single use vape ban in this legislation close by thank the minister and the department for their work in bring the bill forward and for the cross departmental push to make vape safe and reduce its appeal to child hope that it be welcome in all part of the house will focus my comment on the vape element of the bill and particularly the impact on child it be desperately sad and damn reflection on our society that we now need dedicated clinic at alder hey child hospital to treat child as young as for vape addiction be horrify to read professor isba account of child reach for their vape early in the morning before they get out of bed their vape sit next to their mobile phone on the bedside table the alarming rise in nicotine dependency among child be deeply troubling although welcome the fact that the clinic success will lead to similar scheme be roll out across the country that be not sign of progress it be glare wake up call today we have chance through the bill to break the cycle of addiction protect our child and build healthy future for country we face the alarming rise of vaping which have hook record number of young people as former deputy headteacher see vaping spread through school like wildfire catch student hiding vape already hook before they even understand what addiction mean see student who should have be focus on their schoolwork struggle instead with craving that they could not control see teacher battle to keep their student in the classroom instead of sneak puff in the toilet speak to worried parent who feel helpless and never think that their child would be catch up in this vaping be not just bad habit it be trap and too many of our young people be already catch in it the situation that we face do not come about overnight for far too long the previous government fail to act while vape rate among child soar it feel like the stable door be leave wide open and the horse have bolt we could sit back and do nothing and watch another generation of young people in wolverhampton north east and across the country get hook but that be not what responsible government do and it be not what this labour government will do through the bill we will take bold action smokefree zone will be expand to protect child family and the most vulnerable in our community for those who want to quit there will be real support back by real investment deliver real result for too long we have see market design to hook kid on nicotine with bright colour fruity flavour and shameless advertising that deliberately target young people my hon friend be make powerful contribution vaping be not safe alternative for child accord to last year grow up in north yorkshire survey of year student and of year student have try vape with vape regularly do she agree that the bill will put an end to vape deliberately be brand in way that appeal to child be pleased to say that that will end with the bill which will ban vape advertising aim at child outlaw sale from vend machine and crack down on packaging design to attract young eye firm action to protect the health of child include million boost for trading standard to fund more enforcement officer welcome the recent announcement of the million groundbreaking research to investigate the long term health effect of vaping by track young people age eight to over decade unless we prevent illness our nhs will continue to be overwhelm and billion of pound will be spend address problem that could have be curb in advance call on the house to pass the bill in order to protect child in wolverhampton east and across the country let begin by thank all hon and right hon member for their contribution will try and touch on the many amendment discuss and the key question raise at the heart of the bill be the establishment of the smokefree generation by gradually end the sale of tobacco product across the uk amendment to table by the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson amendment to table by the hon member for romford andrew rosindell amendment to table by the hon member for clacton nigel farage and new clause table by the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes would remove that policy or water it down there be no liberty or choice in addiction however and that be why the government be commit to create the world first smokefree generation we have the public backing with of adult support the goal of smokefree britain in yougov poll carry out in november raise the age of sale to will not meet our ambition to make the uk smokefree the shadow minister and other hon member raise the issue of smokefree place and amendment and to would limit those power reassure all hon and right hon member that in england we intend to consult on extend smokefree outdoor place to outside school child playground and hospital private outdoor space be out of scope of the bill power and we recognise that now be not the right time to extend smokefree place to outdoor hospitality setting the power as currently draft ensure that the bill be appropriately future proof any regulation make under the clause will be subject to statutory consultation to ensure that there be sufficient scrutiny of any extension and as health be devolve the devolve government will decide which place they wish to designate as smokefree appreciate the intention of the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan to ensure local authority have fund to address local public health priority it would be inappropriate however for local authority to retain the fix penalty notice for licensing offence as set out in amendment and as that could distort the enforcement priority of local authority and encourage revenue generation council be already provide with ringfenced budget for public health and in we be increase the public health grant to billion we have extend the swap to stop scheme for the come year include free vape kit for smoker to use as quit aid can also confirm today that the national smokefree pregnancy incentive scheme will continue into the come year in response to claim of growth in the illicit market the late official datum from hmrc publish in do not show an overall increase in the illicit market for tobacco up to history show that when we have introduce target tobacco control measure they have have positive impact on tackle the problem of illicit tobacco when the smoking age be increase from to the number of illicit cigarette consume fall by and smoking rate for and year old drop by almost third also understand the aim of the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar with new clause however the new clause be not need the government already publish annual datum on the illicit tobacco market and will do the same for vape follow the introduction of the new vaping product duty in october similarly the association of chief trading standards officer provide annual report and update specifically on enforcement activity which include illegal sale and importation of vape an annual report would only duplicate that although be sympathetic to what the hon member for bath wera hobhouse wish to achieve with new clause vape contaminate with control drug include spice be already illegal and be therefore matter for the police and border force hear what the minister be say but the metropolitan police and other force tell we that it be incredibly difficult the bill give we an extra opportunity to protect young child from terrible pathway into addiction and crime be it not the task of this government to stop that the entire bill be about prevent addiction among our young people and prevent their move into crime these thing be already illegal and the government believe that existing legislation will allow for they to be deal with on cigarette filter understand hon member concern about tobacco litter but new clause table by the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage could lead to greenwashing improve the reputation of tobacco manufacturer while not necessarily improve environmental outcome that be an incredibly lazy argument we do not care about greenwashe greenwashing be just semantic we care about clean up our beach clean up our street and reduce the cost to local council of clean up litter it be ridiculous if the government be go to be sway by one lobby or another and not do the thing that be common sense and much well for our environment thank the hon member for her intervention if be allow to finish that be one of the issue and that proposal may not necessarily improve environmental outcome however we consider that power be already available to the department for environment food and rural affairs that enable the government to limit the damage to the environment cause by filter so the amendment be unnecessary similarly new clause table by my hon friend the member for dartford jim dickson would prohibit the supply of all cigarette filter or cigarette contain filter whether they contain plastic or not ultimately we believe that the good way to tackle filter be through the reduction of smoking rate on bundle of tobacco product the bill give the government the power to regulate retail packaging of tobacco product and device herbal smoking product and cigarette paper as well as vaping and nicotine product in addition the bill already give the government power to regulate how product be package together in bundle so amendment and also table by my hon friend be not necessary amendment and and new clause to and would all undermine our promise to the electorate to stop vape be advertise to child we have clear mandate with of adult in great britain supportive of ban and we will not create any exemption that could undermine this on amendment and new clause let reassure the shadow secretary of state and my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend mary glindon that the government be not prohibit the promotion of vape in general as smoking cessation tool let reassure my hon friend the members for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend and for suffolk coastal jenny riddell carpenter that the bill already provide the government with power to limit the amount of nicotine in nicotine pouch to regulate vaping product in such way that would prohibit the sale of high puff count vaping device include set tank capacity limit for device where multiple refill tank be attach and to ban any other ingredient that may be harmful the government believe that these measure be more appropriate for secondary legislation due to the technical detail that need to be capture rather than in primary legislation as new clause and would require on amendment table by my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend we recognise that vape flavour be really important consideration for adult smoker seek to quit smoking but we also know that sweet or fruity flavour be the main flavour that appeal to child and that certain flavour and ingredient can be particularly harmful to health we have be clear that we will carefully consider our future regulation so that we get the balance right and this be subject to statutory duty to consult similarly reassure my hon friend that amendment be unnecessary we will honour the long establish principle of good consultation when consult on regulation under part of the bill include in relation to who be consult on new clause and while the government be commit to protect child from the risk of harm through addiction our approach across all product in the bill be for age to be verify at the point of sale not at the point of use mandate any age gate technology for vape would create harsh restriction on vaping than smoking that could make vape less accessible and attractive to adult smoker wish to quit and use vape as smoking cessation tool recognise the concern of the hon member for harrow east bob blackman about online sale however it would not be proportionate to ban all online sale because that would impact on those retailer seek to operate within the law as be discuss in committee go back to the issue of wide enforcement new clause and amendment do not reflect the complex process require to develop the licensing scheme in england and wales although be sympathetic to the shadow secretary of state aim rush to publish draft regulation within two month of royal assent would risk create flawed policy pay tribute to colleague in the scottish government welsh government and the northern ireland executive this uk wide bill have be develop in partnership with they and thank they for their support our manifesto commit to reset our relationship with the devolved government and this bill be great success in demonstrate collaboration across government in improve the health of the nation since the tobacco directive apply to northern ireland under the protocol through section of the act and apply directly and the directive forbid the type of proposition in this bill would the minister care to explain to the house how this bill will be applicable in northern ireland as long as the tobacco directive apply this bill have be put together as say with collaboration across all the government and bear in mind all the government legal obligation under the law all those thing have be take into account and the bill be able to be bring forward in that way our manifesto commit to deliver the smokefree generation and we be work across all government to ensure that we deliver that as well as honour our international obligation as result the government do not consider new clause table by the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister to be necessary that be because we be content that measure draft in the bill that apply in relation to northern ireland be consistent with our obligation under the windsor framework and the propose new clause would put we in breach of international law in the drafting of the bill as have state we have consider all its domestic and international obligation and it be for those reason that the government can not support new clause the bill will bring about real change by create smokefree generation as we have discuss there be no liberty or choice in addiction and almost all smoker want to quit and two third wish they have never start start smoke at the age of and decide would stop when be could not stop think know stop when be and then it be then it be when graduate and then it be when have child at no point be able to give up this pernicious addiction it take cancer diagnosis to scare into be able to stop smoking and do not wish that on any of our young people in conclusion many of the amendment be unnecessary because the bill already grant the government the power to take forward the issue through the more appropriate route of secondary legislation this be landmark bill the most significant public health intervention in generation it strike the right balance on the interest of public health by be proportionate and not overly burdensome it allow the government to bring forward the appropriate primary and secondary legislation to ensure that we can deliver smokefree generation that protect all our child from the addiction of tobacco uniquely harmful substance debate interrupt programme order november the deputy speaker put forthwith the question already propose from the chair standing order no that the clause be read second time question agree to new clause accordingly read second time

tom nolan can now say that follow the ukrainian resettlement in coatbridge not only the irish national day be celebrate in the town there be well attend celebration of ukrainian independence day in august at the town summerlee museum the programme include performance of ukrainian music and dance it be incredibly powerful to have the virtual attendance of family member and friend on facetime call from ukraine who watch on as ukrainian child in coatbridge honour their heritage there have be celebration of the nativity hold by the local ukrainian community as well as museum exhibition about the plight of ukrainian refugee the fact that the ukrainians who have settle in coatbridge feel comfortable to celebrate their national heritage and to engage the local community in do so highlight the

remind member that when they be make intervention they should do so through the chair not least because that enable the microphone to pick up what they have say can assure you madam deputy speaker that my hon friend make good point as say they be extraordinary action take by ordinary people who open up their home to those flee the most horrendous situation my hon friend be absolutely right that in those early day that be critical action take by people not just in my constituency and hers but across the country the warm welcome receive by ukrainians be in stark contrast to the violence continue to emanate in ukraine from the russian invader perhaps my scottish colleague will have read the recent article in holyrood magazine which contain testimony from resident at high coats one resident olga speak of the challenging initial period in scotland live in emergency accommodation on ms victoria dock in leith her only request of the resettlement team be to have sunlight after five month of live in ship dim cabin with the move to coatbridge olga say her son begin to smile again make friend in the local school local primary school namely greenhill primary school and st patrick

tower now host full range of cultural and wellbee opportunity include english language class walk club and employability programme and it even establish tenant and resident association which be great to see the achievement and success of this programme have be the result of multidisciplinary effort incorporate housing service health partner school social work department community learning and development faith group and local organisation in the voluntary sector this comprehensive effort touch on all area of public service and community partnership make big difference to those flee the turmoil of war it can be an antidote to the disarray and insecure feeling that so many refugee experience permanent accommodation as have be provide in north lanarkshire can also make last difference to circumstance and outcome as have say there be real lesson that the minister and her home office team could learn from the approach take in north lanarkshire and know that the scottish and welsh governments have closely monitor the programme because it be an innovative local solution to the crisis it would be remiss of not to say that it be important that the department continue to look at the situation regard visa as there be grow trepidation among ukrainian refugee the department should give further consideration to additional step and to the possibility of permanent right to remain appreciate that there remain uncertainty about the conflict but some ukrainians be concerned about the expiration of their month visa extension and the impact of that at the commencement of the conflict and in the month and year since people in my constituency refuse to walk by on the other side of the street they step up as people have do across the country for those who have flee the terror ukraine be and will always be home and never far from their thought be those who be lose or in peril family and friend whose life have be take prematurely or who continue to face down russian aggressor on the frontline while they defend their city town village and land be it small or large their thought be also with the ukrainian child so cruelly steal at least of they and their lost home lose connection lose livelihood and lose time they seek lasting and just peace as we all do but until then we must and will stand shoulder to shoulder with ukraine and its people slava ukraini it be pleasure to contribute to this short debate will be brief but want to thank my hon friend the member for coatbridge and bellshill frank mcnally for secure this debate and add my comment to his in praise of the excellent work do by people and community in his constituency it be pleasure to hear such heart warm story come out of such dark and difficult situation like my hon friend constituency my home city of glasgow have long proud record of welcome refugee the city have eventually become their home in many case my constituency of glasgow west have particular record of welcome people flee conflict in their native land in the drumchapel play host to many people flee chile because of the brutal and fascist regime of general pinochet many of those refugee be fortunate enough to be able to return home after pinochet downfall but other choose to stay and make scotland their home and many of those who stay end in lanarkshire close to where my hon friend be from in the present day my area have welcome the ukrainian refugee flee putin murderous onslaught in their country many of they as my hon friend say be originally accommodate in cruise liner not the good of start perhaps but at least it be safe refuge for they and it be there that many of the cultural activity and school classroom that have be develop begin the fact that people be together in confine space obviously help make that happen the joyous part of the story for both the ukrainian and chilean community be that our local glaswegian community have be so enrich by be able to be part of their life and their celebration and they have learn so much about another culture on the way over the past three year have attend many concert and church service that have be both move and enjoyable on august last year be delighted to again join in the ukrainian independence day family fun event in victoria park in my constituency an annual event that be much anticipate with workshop music and dance as well as sporting event it be truly fun day but hope nobody will ask to demonstrate what learn as definitely do not have the skill to replicate ukrainian art try very hard but be afraid that my attempt be pretty pathetic be not plan to intervene but be minded to mention the anniversary of operation open door in which the royal navy go to norway to rescue refugee who be under extreme terror from the nazis they be bring to my constituency to the village of neilston where they find sanctuary and humanity among the villager do she agree that the relationship and cultural exchange that she describe will last for generation as they have in my constituency agree with my hon friend when there be more time will share with he my experience of be the manager of glasgow dental hospital where many
