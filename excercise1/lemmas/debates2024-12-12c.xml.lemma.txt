the government consider reinstate the trade show access programme close down by the conservatives to help more small and medium sized enterprise trade around the world my hon friend be absolutely right that we have to do more to help small business in particular and business in general to export more overseas that be one of the key but often understate way in which we can deliver growth for this country as part of our work on new trade strategy and small business strategy we be look at further proposal to help our business export more the italian press have be report that the global combat air programme consortium involve the uk italy and japan might be extend to include saudi arabia can the minister confirm this press report how would that affect any future decision to suspend licence to export arm to saudi arabia as the government decide to in we be look at work with other gcap partner be in italy last month to discuss the further potential of gcap and other work that we

confidence the government be force to make difficult choice in the budget but the fundamental of do business in the uk remain strong the government agenda of create an industrial strategy get people back to work reform our planning system rebuild our relationship with the eu pension reform and more be entirely focus on improve the long term business environment across the uk in the aftermath of the budget speak with many business leader in my constituency of solihull west and shirley invariably they tell that they be pause recruitment and freeze their growth plan as direct consequence of the decision make around taxation and the employment rights bill what do the secretary of state say to those business in my constituency that no long have confidence in the government and feel abandon by their policy say that the budget be seven week ago so if the conservative party which do not tell we how it would pay for the promise it make when it be in government now have plan to pay for those promise would welcome receive it in writing or hear it here at oral question or in statement the raw reality be that the conservative party make promise that it have no intention of keeping we be not go to do that we will fix the foundation and do what we say the reason this government will succeed on growth and business investment in way that the previous government do not have to do with the fundamental the return to political stability in the uk an openness to the rest of the world include the eu difficult subject for conservative members know which be still our major trading partner and the willingness of this government to use their mandate to improve the business and investor environment those fundamental mean that the future of the uk be very promising steel manufacturing be vital west midland industry but business confidence be be dent by retrospective charging of steel safeguarding duty by his majesty revenue and customs company that be affect in my constituency and elsewhere feel that such duty be unfairly and wrongly impose on they during the chaotic brexit transition period they try to work with the last government but get nowhere give the importance of the steel sector to british industry will the minister work with the treasury to resolve the issue and ensure that these vital business be protect from hefty bill that they should never have be send in the first place thank my hon friend for raise that important matter give the sum of money involve can understand why that be substantial issue for business in her constituency it relate to the duty that be charge at time of significant political uncertainty this be treasury issue relate to taxation but promise we will get she the meeting she need and work with she to ensure that she get the answer she request for her constituent call the shadow minister there be no clear pointer on business confidence than the bank of england recent survey on employer response to the budget some expect low profit margin expect to raise price expect low employment and expect to pay low wage than they otherwise would have now city am report that labour have carelessly lose all its business backer will the secretary of state show any contrition admit that business confidence be through the floor and start stand up for business rather than the treasury well what can say be it the conservative party that increase corporation tax from to in one budget and that crash business investment and confidence because of the way it mishandle brexit fail to prepare for either outcome of yes no referendum and which opposition front benchers play role in the mini budget frankly it be all of they with respect to the hon gentleman will not take advice from he since the budget have hear repeatedly from conservative colleague that they want to lower taxis and increase spending even though they can not account for the promise that they make when in government that be not credible unless they engage with reality as this government be do whether it be the response to the chancellor speech at mansion house or finally sort out marks spencer this week this government be get on with the job and look to the future sorry seem to be the hard word interruption be talk about the government budget further proof of how low business confidence be get under this government be give in evidence to the employment rights bill committee jane gratton of the british chamber of commerce predict reduced hire appetite be this legislation to come in and that their member would be less likely to recruit new employee due to the risk and difficulty particularly under the day one report employment rights public bill committee november if business confidence be low employment go down we already know that every labour government leave unemployment high than when they take office but be it not bit extreme for this labour government to legislate for that outcome if the hon gentleman google that statistic he will find that it be not actually true but appreciate that it be demand be in opposition and that there may not always be the capacity and resource require as we hear on the excellent second reading of that legislation the vast majority of employer in the uk already operate to high standard than the level to which the floor be be raise in the employment rights bill do not in any way pull back from say that some of the most vulnerable insecure and low pay member of our society will benefit from the bill that be exactly what it be about those people may have give up on politic or think that the mainstream political system will not deliver for they reject the claim that certain industry require supply of labour from job that do not give people the security and dignity that they need this be set of proportionate reasonable reform that will make difference order have list of speaker here call munira wilson paid employment leave kinship carers if he will make an assessment with the secretary of state for education of the potential merit of introduce right to pay employment leave for kinship carer we recognise the vital role that kinship carer play in care for vulnerable child

authority we will also review the parental leave system to ensure that it well support all work family and work be already under way to plan for that delivery be sure the minister will agree that kinship carer be unsung hero who often step up at moment notice to look after child whose parent can not but four in be force to give up work to do so which mean they often struggle to pay the bill or put food on the table will the minister look to right that wrong through the employment rights bill and introduce right to pay employment leave for kinship carer give the saving to the public purse

hospitality business from welcome the hon lady support for that measure ukhospitality have estimate that the budget measure will increase the cost of employ one employee by shop pub and restaurant across my constituency have say that that will lead to high price or few job will the minister at least consider delay the implementation of the national insurance contribution increase to when the plan realignment of business rate be due to come in be sure that the right hon gentleman will have notice that in the budget the chancellor more than double the employment allowance to that will mean that more than million small business many of they hospitality business will see no increase in their national insurance liability next year free trade deal farmer what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of free trade deal on farmer our approach to trade deal consider the impact on and opportunity for the agricultural sector along with other sector of the economy and of course our growth mission the government will publish impact assessment to aid the ratification process for new free trade agreement work with farmer for many year as veterinary surgeon and now meet they regularly as an mp so be aware that farmer in hampshire and the rest of the country be hugely disappoint when the previous conservative government sign trade deal that undermine our high animal welfare standard what step be the minister take to ensure that after future trade deal british farmer will not have to compete with product produce to low animal welfare standard for example battery hen or product that involve the indiscriminate use of antibiotic which be also public health issue it be not only vet and farmer who be proud of our high animal welfare standard but the british public so will the minister confirm that he do not want to compromise on those standard be grateful to the hon gentleman for bring his considerable expertise in veterinary science to the chamber today we will not compromise on animal welfare standard as we take forward our programme of free trade agreement although we might well have approach the negotiation that the previous government undertake in different manner reopen they would certainly create uncertainty which we genuinely believe would hurt uk business we be not see australian or new zealand beef and lamb flood the uk market and we will continue to monitor trade flow under both those free trade agreement he make very fair and important point about the need to maintain welfare standard small and medium sized business what step his

operative and mutual the diversity in business model that they bring be huge strength they bring different thing to the market and different way of do business the resilience in co operative model be particularly attractive can assure she that they form part of the government wide strategy our ambition be to double mutual size in the economy the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend the member for harrow west gareth thomas the small business minister be lead on that work and would love my hon friend and business from her area to be involve in it last week have the pleasure of visit the winner of my first small business saturday award in southampton itchen they be riann care the bunker miss ellie café and julie dance studio will the secretary of state join in congratulate they on their role in ensure thriving local economy what assurance he can offer they that this government have the back of small business be extremely grateful to my hon friend for his

business the government agenda include long term reform of business rate to create permanently low business rate for retail hospitality and leisure the launch of high street rental auction get rid of derelict property in town centre be also hugely exciting the business growth service be predominantly about recognise that although the government do lot business can often find it hard to access exactly what they need have look around the world to the us and its small business administration and to singapore and its enterprise singapore for example to discover the good model that be what we will take forward in and find it hugely exciting agenda last saturday be indeed small business saturday it be an opportunity for we to celebrate and support the many small business in our constituency however too many of they be really worried about the increase in national insurance contribution the billion job tax and there be simply no easy answer for they they can not just put up their price so they be look at staffing level why be the government so against aspiration and how do they think they will improve productivity and deliver growth in the economy conservative members know what they leave behind and have not hear any of they offer an alternative the specific answer to the right hon member question be that employment allowance be double in the budget and the threshold be take off that be why million mainly small business be pay less or the same in national insurance contribution as they be before the budget she should tell the house how the conservative party would pay for the infected blood scandal the victim of which we be all commit to compensate post office compensation support for the steel industry and the advanced manufacturing plan that we inherit because none of that be in our departmental budget we be fix the foundation with long term public investment and an agenda base on high business investment and well strong economic growth in every part of the uk the government have raise national insurance charge on employer and introduce family farm and family business tax the employment rights bill will raise business cost by billion predominantly for small business as result of those change do the secretary of state believe that sme will employer more or few people have absolutely no doubt that the government agenda be one for employment business investment and growth some of the thing that this country need the most could only have be deliver by change of government simply do not believe that the conservative party be capable of reform the planning system or have long term industrial strategy fix our relationship with the european union and all the rest of it yes there have be challenge but the conservatives know what they leave behind they know what they be do there be reason the conservative party have no spending plan for the next financial year we have have to confront that reality but we can not have the kind of success that this country need unless we be willing to fix the foundation and focus on the long term the chancellor do that in the budget and the agenda of the department for business and trade be extremely attractive for the future call the shadow minister some of the most successful small and medium sized business which truly think long term be own by family so why do the secretary of state think that it will help his long term growth mission for the government to start tax those business when they get pass on to the next generation with respect hear lot of call from the conservatives to cut taxis and increase spending but still no account of how they would do that appreciate that sometimes the initial transfer into opposition can feel exhilarating but there be responsibility that come with it would like to see an account from the conservative of how they would pay for it for all tax change across the board we can still say with real confidence that the uk have competitive tax system benchmark our corporation tax and the allowance on it our capital gain taxis and in this case our inheritance taxis the mistake that the conservatives make be that they forget that the adjustment to specific relief for business and agricultural property be on top of the exist inheritance tax threshold frankly little less scaremongere from the opposition and bit of focus on what be really at stake would be welcome call the liberal democrat spokesperson small business be at the heart of our local community firm such as carbon threesixty in my constituency be cut edge manufacturer of carbon fibre product however its growth as small business be seriously affect by its ability to attract and retain quality staff predominantly because of the poor public transport and completely non existent cycle route these issue cut right across departments would therefore be grateful if the secretary of state could confirm what discussion he have have with ministerial colleague in other departments about how rural transport infrastructure would greatly support small and medium sized business welcome the hon member question she be right that some of the issue that most affect business in our constituency often sit in other departments the role of my department be to focus on and champion those issue across all of government whether they sit neatly in the department or not she correctly highlight the incredible and important role that rural business play and their social as well as economic benefit her point about transport be well make one of the big change in the budget be the ability to focus on long term investment which be recognise by the office for budget responsibility in its assessment that the productive potential of the uk will grow significantly over the next decade because of that increase focus investment investment investment transport be great element of that whether in my constituency or in hers assure she that the need that she articulate be consider at the high level of government chancellor mansion house speech funding plan what step his department be take to support the delivery of the funding plan outline in the chancellor of the exchequer mansion house speech what step his department be take to support the delivery of the funding plan outline in the chancellor of the exchequer mansion house speech growth be the government no mission

january will include monday january business to be determine by the backbench business committee further business will be announce in the usual way what marvellous time of year it be when see the christmas tree in new palace yard and the trilling sound of the parliamentary and salvation army choir to boot on slightly more sober note you will recall mr speaker that the story of this government so far have be one of early scandal first reset and delayed budget and now what we can expect to be delay spending review we must hope that at some point the government will get round to actually make policy be afraid that this week have bring further confirmation of the disastrous effect of the november budget as member will recall the institute for fiscal studies predict at the time that the rise in national insurance would hit low wage and more labour intensive part of the economy hard and predict that the chancellor may need to raise taxis again soon the chancellor reaction as she tell the cbi be really clear not come back with more borrowing or more taxis we will see how long that promise last only this week the financial times report that hiring have fall more sharply in the uk than in other major economy over the past year include the us france germany canada and australia luckily however we now have the government new plan for change think the whole house should welcome the fact that the government now have plan only year and seven month after they first start in opposition and that their plan be to change direction would describe the plan for change as fine fat herefordshire beef cow that have be inadequately feed with the reform party favourite anti methane feed supplement bovaer it be beast full of nutrition but with certain amount of unnecessary flatulence lot of medium commentator have have fun with the government blizzard of to do list include their six first step six milestone five national mission and three foundation but be afraid that they have miss the christmas spirit of the thing all we need now be policy announcement on turtle dove and partridge in pear tree to complete their new initiative advent calendar jest mr speaker come not to bury caesar but to praise he be not go to indulge in the easy mockery of the commentariat on the contrary can report genuine sign of reality break through in the plan for change something rarely see in document from this government the prime minister say in the incoming government inherit public finance in desperate need of repair he be absolutely right public finance in be in desperate need of repair he also say that we need profound cultural shift away from declinist mentality which have become comfortable with failure and again think he be absolutely right finally and most notably he say that we can not tax our way to prosperity or spend our way to well public service not only that but the government have sensibly drop their commitment to clean energy by as conservative members have call for and as specifically highlight only couple of week ago the plan for change be revolutionary gospel indeed honest about the poor performance of the previous labour government realistic in not seek to blame government for wide global event seek to adopt long term approach and recognise the need to limit tax and spending all we can hope now be that someone spread this revolutionary gospel in the christmas spirit to the rest of the government but also have various concern about the plan for change that would like to put to the house it barely mention the crucial short term issue and long term issue of defence highlight once again this week by event in syria or the vital long term issue of social care which all party concede have be inadequately handle over the past year these be extraordinary omission in what purport to be an inclusive long term reset for the government there be more fundamental question to be address too the idea of mission be fashionable one in policy circle but it imply total commitment to the goal how will that be reconcile with the obligation of the civil service and the prime minister new efficiency tsar to demonstrate short term value for money how will all this be reconcile with the government intense desire to campaign aggressively against those they see as their political enemy rather than recruit they soberly to political consensus that could provide sustainable basis for these mission would be very interested to know what the leader of the house think on these issue and how they will shape her approach to the conduct of future business in this house may start by say how appalled be be sure the whole house be about the detail that have emerge on the murder of sara sharif may say on behalf of the government that nothing be more important than keep child safe we be committed to further reform of child social care and much strong safeguard for child be take into home education that be long overdue and further detail will be announce imminently take this opportunity to congratulate the new chair of the liaison committee my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg

the modernisation committee call for view end next monday we have have huge interest in this agenda from members old and new encourage everyone to submit their idea think we might have have little bit

we be deliver it the country vote for change they vote to change from the conservatives government and record they vote to improve their living standard they vote to change the nhs and they vote because they want this country to be fix he raise defence and social care spending perhaps that be his good christmas joke so far because the conservatives record on that be woeful we will not take any lecture from they on that be afraid the truth be that we be six week into the new leader of the opposition tenure and the conservatives strategy for opposition be as clear as mud they seem to have learn nothing they have no new idea they disown their record one day and defend it the next perhaps instead of the right hon gentleman ridiculous tired commentary they could reflect and apologise for the mess they leave and ensure that the country get the change it deserve rise the leader of the house rightly mention live case hope nobody will add to that because it be in the court at the moment

house on this important matter think we do really well and it be great that we have manage to complete business question only minute or so over time build homes with your permission mr speaker would like to update the house on our plan to build the home our country so desperately need this labour government be elect five month ago with mandate to deliver national renewal stand on the step of downing street on july the prime minister make it clear that work on that urgent task would begin immediately and it do within our first month in office we propose bold set of reform to overhaul planning system that be falter on all front after decade of piecemeal and inept tinker by the conservative party today confirm to the house that we be deliver the change we promise by publish an update national planning policy framework meet our commitment to do so before the end of the year and support our ambitious plan for change milestone of build million new home in this parliament the case for grasp the nettle of planning reform in order significantly to boost housing supply and unleash economic growth be incontrovertible england be in the grip of an acute and entrenched housing crisis and as you mr speaker and every member of the house will know its detrimental consequence be now all pervasive generation lock out of home ownership million people languish on social housing waiting list million of low income household force into insecure unaffordable and far too often substandard private rent housing and to our shame as nation just shy of homeless child live right now in temporary accommodation our economy and the public service that our constituent rely on be also suffer because as well as blight countless life the housing crisis be consume ever large amount of public money in the form of rapidly rise housing benefit bill it be also hamper economic growth and productivity by reduce labour mobility and undermine the capacity of our great town and city to realise their full economic potential the government be under no illusion about the scale of the task before we or the challenge that must be overcome and the pitfall avoid if we be to succeed but we be absolutely determined to tackle this crisis head on the previous government of course take different view not only do they fail to meet even once the target of home year that they set themselves but in forlorn attempt to appease their anti house building back benchers they consciously and deliberately choose to exacerbate the housing crisis by make change to national planning policy that have contribute to plummet housing supply we know that the change require to start put thing right will be uncomfortable for some we know we will face resistance from vested interest but this labour government will not duck the hard choice that must be confront to tackle the housing crisis because the alternative be future in which decent safe secure and affordable home be privilege enjoy only by some rather than be the birthright of all work people let turn to the change that we be make to the framework we receive more than response to our consultation alongside which my official and have hold extensive engagement with private house builder affordable housing provider local authority and other organisation from the sector the view share with we have be invaluable in help to refine our initial proposal so that we be able to introduce an effective package of reform before set out number of important area in which we have make change let touch briefly on some of the proposal that we intend to implement unamended first we have reverse the anti supply change introduce by the last government almost exactly year ago from the abandonment of mandatory housing target to the softening of land supply and delivery test provision the policy that give local authority the freedom to plan for less housing than their nominal target imply be no more secondly we have make explicit the importance of growth support development from lab to data centre to supply chain and logistic in the same vein we have make clear that the default position for renewable energy deployment should be yes thirdly we strongly promote mixed tenure development reflect robust evidence that attest to the fact that such development build out fast and create diverse community fourthly we have make series of change to bolster affordable housing delivery and enable local authority to determine the right mix of affordable housing for their community that will support our commitment to deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in generation there be four important area where we have refine our proposal and will turn first to housing target as we make clear when launch the consultation in july restore mandatory standard method for assess housing need be insufficient if the method itself be not up to the job as the house will know we propose bold change increase the total annual national target from to end the reliance on decade old population projection and remove the arbitrary urban uplift that result in skewed national distribution that be disproportionately focus on london to the detriment of the rest of the country we fully intend to maintain the level of ambition outline in july but we hear through the consultation clear view that we should do more to target housing growth in those place where affordability pressure be most acute we have therefore make the method more responsive to demand redistribute housing target towards those place where housing be least affordable while maintain the overall target envelope next let turn to our reform to the green belt as the house know ours be brownfield first approach to development as result of number of target change we be make to the framework and our proposal for brownfield passport we be prioritise and fast track building on previously develop urban land wherever possible but we know that there be simply not enough site on brownfield land register to deliver the volume of home that the country need each year let alone enough that be viable and in the right location in the summer we propose that local authority take sequential approach to release land to meet their housing need brownfield first follow by low quality land in the green belt and only then higher perform land to identify low perform site we propose definition of grey belt land that reflect the fact that there be area currently designate as green belt that contribute little by way of aesthetic public access or ecological value that approach receive broad support through the consultation but strong desire be express to limit the room for subjectivity we have therefore set out clear description of how to assess whether land meet the definition of grey belt and we will be provide further guidance to local authority in the new year to support they with green belt review at the centre of our green belt reform lie our golden rule which be design to make sure that where green belt land be release the public derive real benefit from development on it include more affordable housing to meet local need in the consultation we propose flat affordable housing target but we recognise that because land value vary across the country the limited use of viability assessment should be permit through the consultation we have recognise that that approach risk uncertainty if flexibility be need in some part of the country because land value be low the precise amount of affordable housing to be secure would become protract site by site negotiation if local authority do not allow flexibility there would be risk that site be render unviable with the result that no house affordable or otherwise would get build our final policy therefore take different approach to manage variation in land value rather than single target we be introduce percentage point premium on top of target set in local plan up to maximum of because that mean the target itself will be responsive to local circumstance we will be restrict the ability for site specific viability assessment until such time as we have amend viability guidance in the spring of next year by prioritise pragmatism over purity the golden rule we be put in place today will give community the confidence that they will be meet and will maximise the number of affordable home deliver across the country another area where we have make change be to the presumption in favour of sustainable development the presumption sit at the heart of the national planning policy framework and mean that where local authority have under deliver or an up to date local plan be not in place the balance of decision making be tilt in favour of approval we be determined to ensure that where the presumption apply it will have real tooth at the same time we be clear that development consent through it must be consistent with the clear requirement in national policy relate to sustainability density design and the provision of affordable home the change we have make deliver on both those front finally in the consultation we seek view on how our change apply to local authority at an advanced stage of plan make our propose transitional arrangement aim to strike balance between maintain the progress of plan at more advanced stage of preparation while maximise proactive planning for the home our community need the core of our proposal that we only hold back draft plan where there be significant gap between the current propose housing requirement and the new housing target be well support however we be make three change first we have take on board concern that the transitional period be too tight so we will provide local planning authority with an extra two month to progress their plan extend the transitional period from one month to three secondly and again respond to an ask we hear repeatedly from council the transitional arrangement will apply where the draft housing requirement in the plan meet at least of local housing need rather than the numerical home threshold we originally propose in those instance the plan will not be hold back thirdly where plan be adopt under these arrangement and where there be exist plan base on the old target due to run for number of year yet we want to see the level of ambition raise soon rather than later as result from july we will expect authority with plan adopt under the old standard method to provide an extra year worth of home in their housing pipeline help to accelerate the delivery of new home we recognise that we be ask much from many local authority and we be determined to support local leader try in good faith to deliver home for their community that be why across dedicated local plan funding the planning capacity and capability support announce at the budget and income from raise fee we will be inject more than million into the system in the come year we be confident that the revise framework that we be introduce today will support significantly high rate of house building and sustain economic growth we have listen carefully to the view express in the consultation and adjust several area of policy accordingly now it be for other to do their part developer must turn supportive word into action bring forward new site and build they out at pace local authority must embrace the challenge of high target and push for more and well development in their area we have move fast we have not hold back we have not shy away from controversial decision or waver in the face of those who have seek to chip away at our resolve with focus and determination we have push on to ensure that we be put in place planning system gear toward meet housing need in full and unleash economic growth change will take time as home be not build overnight and our dire inheritance mean that the climb out of the trough we be in will be steep one but by implement this revise framework today we have take another decisive step toward future in which everyone will enjoy decent safe secure and affordable home in which to live call the shadow secretary of state thank the minister for advance sight of his statement first welcome the ambitious target of million home in this parliament think he may have unintentionally mislead the house regard the dire inheritance that he claim conservative members be rightly proud of our record on housing delivery interruption really between and we see record level of new housing formation great than any other period since the we deliver affordable home since include in alone what we do not welcome be the war on rural england that the minister be pursue follow on from the family farm tax and the withdrawal of the rural service delivery grant we now see massive shift to mass house building in rural area and on green belt we do not welcome the bulldozing of democratic accountability we do not welcome the lowering of housing target for urban area include reduction in london which be already miss its target by we also do not welcome an average doubling increase for predominantly rural area the reality for local resident in area such as westmorland cumberland north yorkshire and the home county be that they will one day wake up to realise that they will face target of up to increase they will call their local councillor to ask they to oppose specific application and be shock at the response which will be be sorry we no long have the right to vote against an individual application they will be even more shocked if they become aware of what labour say in opposition its opposition motion on june call on the previous government to protect the right of community to object to individual planning application the minister be now take that away local resident will be more shocked again when they become aware that the minister himself use that right in to object to an application for home on brownfield site in his constituency indeed the secretary of state also use that right to object to development in her constituency in same old labour do as say not as do the reality be that the government will fail to deliver on their target member need not listen to they should listen to the chief executive officer of homes england who admit in leak email that it be two parliament objective rather than deliverable in this parliament the centre for cities and the office for budget responsibility have both say that only million home will be deliver in england in this parliament and indeed there will be only million home across the uk which be low than we deliver in the last parliament another broken promise from labour as the leader of the opposition say we will be there for the minister and the secretary of state when they fail to deliver on that promise this planning framework push development to rural area concrete over green belt green field and over our green and pleasant land rather than focus and support building in urban area where we need to build the most and to what end due to the loosening of restriction on visa requirement such as the salary threshold and the scrapping of the rwanda deterrent the majority of the home that the government deliver will be require for people come into this country rather than for british citizen labour have also consistently fail on affordable home under the london labour mayor new affordable housing in london be down by yet across england the conservative government deliver more than half million home they have already weaken their requirement for affordable home on the green belt by allow the use of viability assessment that change will mean few affordable home the labour government have already fail first time buyer the conservative government double the number of those buy every year compare with by mean of the stamp duty discount help to buy right to buy and our affordable home programme some of which help the secretary of state herself get on the housing ladder those have be ax by this socialist government pull up the housing ladder they will build over rural area while claim it be grey belt land but we deliver over million home in the last parliament alone it be vital more than ever that we build in the right place with the right infrastructure but the prime minister have already admit that he will bulldoze through the concern of local community if the government really want home to be build where they be need they must think again finally how many of the minister million home will be affordable what do he expect will be the split for social rent affordable rent and affordable home to purchase particularly give the use of viability assessment on planning capacity will he set out why his resourcing of planning authority which we broadly welcome have rise from million in his manifesto to million in the budget to million today how be that consistent with the budget why be he deliberately make it more difficult for first time buyer to buy home what percentage of the million target do he expect will be need for immigrant household thank the hon gentleman for some of his response and for those question be glad that he broadly support the government target of million home as he will know the previous government do not achieve their home year when disaggregate once in year there be so many inaccuracy and mislead statement in that response and fundamental misunderstanding of the framework that we have plan that be not sure where to start the assertion that we be wag war on rural england or that we have distribute housing target predominantly towards rural area be simply wrong we be the hon gentleman might wish to listen to the response and focus on the detail of the framework that we have publish we be focus growth across our city region housing need across mayoral combine authority area will increase by over compare with the current standard method similarly on the green belt it be not the case that we be allow viability assessment be very clear in my statement we be restrict the use of site level viability assessment on green belt release until we have refresh viability planning policy guidance in the new year at which point we will consider exemption for previously develop land and large site we prioritise the importance of up to date local plan we inherit system from the previous government of less than third up to date local plan coverage that be unsustainable we want community more involve at an early stage shape their local plan that be the good way that they can shape development the hon gentleman mischaracterise our work paper proposal on plan committee as we discuss at length in the urgent question early in the week we be simply talk about streamline the planning system to ensure that train professional planning officer take the appropriate decision and elect member get to focus on the large and most controversial application be not go to respond to the taunt about site in my constituency why not because have outline my position many many time before object to home scheme that think be poor quality think we could do well it be very interesting note to opposition members that consent for that be give many year ago but not spade have be put in the ground that be the type of speculative development we need to see less of we need more plan development through the planning system will briefly answer the hon gentleman question we can not put precise number on the proportion of home under the million target that will be affordable for the follow reason we expect to see many more social and affordable home come through developer contribution our golden rule which apply to the release of land through the green belt will ensure that the proportion rise that premium on local affordable housing rate as the hon gentleman will be aware affordable provision be partly relate to grant funding from government we will set out detail of future investment in next year multi year spending review along with what the successor to the affordable home programme look like and the precise split between social rent home and other form of tenure we have be very clear that we want to maximise the delivery of social value home detail on planning capacity will be set out in the response to the consultation the million figure cite be the amount of support in the round go into local plan support planning capacity and capability support and other thing on migration the hon gentleman know as well as do that the majority of home that developer sell in this country be to british national that most part of the country have local allocation rule and residency requirement that mean that non british national can not access housing and that only those who be eligible for no recourse to public fund can do so he know those rule it be scaremongere it be beneath he know that the hon gentleman do not really believe that and that the house do not believe that either call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee welcome the great detail on the change to the nppf that the minister have outline this morning he be right we have to be bold as he have outline the social housing sector be in crisis at the select committee recent evidence session he mention figure of around child in temporary accommodation those child will be spend this christmas away from their friend and family for the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake the shadow secretary of state to reduce this issue to migration be wrong he should think about the many child who will be sleep rough this christmas this be about how we improve housing and ensure that we build the right housing to help those child we need more social housing to get people off our waiting list our council be at break point with some developer use the viability clause as way of not deliver on the much need affordable home that they have promise community must be able to trust the planning process will the minister assure the house that local council will see significant increase in the affordable home programme next year to allow they to meet the government housing target secondly want to touch briefly on the land classification outline in the strategy which could affect the way in which community be able to shape local development too often we see disproportionate impact on high end development which do nothing to help people to get on the housing ladder be the minister confident that the update to the nppf will ensure that new home will be base in improve development with amenity such as school gp surgery and other accessible thing so that local resident can see tangible benefit in the development come forward in their area thank the chair of the select committee for those question and for her broad support for the framework we have announce today on social rent housing in particular she be absolutely right the previous conservative government record on social rent home be absolutely dire the figure speak for themselves not only do they fail to deliver new social affordable home beyond anything more than unit year but they engineer the decline of social housing and run down our stock through various intervention include the slashing of affordable home programme funding and increase generosity in the to buy discount which my right hon friend the deputy prime minister do not benefit from we have return the discount to the rate at which she access housing the conservatives record on social rent housing speak for itself on future investment in affordable housing and social rent home as have say we will set out detail in the multi year spending review next year we want to prioritise the delivery of social rent home give the important role they play in address the housing crisis and in resolve the particularly acute end of that crisis in the form of temporary accommodation on the nppf more widely can give my hon friend those assurance the target change to the framework we have make today will support the delivery of structure as have already say when it come to the release of green belt land our golden rule will ensure that we get high proportion of affordable housing and also infrastructure and amenity and access to green space through that additional public benefit call the liberal democrat spokesperson the liberal democrats support the provision of new home somerset west and taunton district council in my constituency under liberal democrat control since have approve thousand of new home to the extent that the town be now one of the fast grow in the uk with population growth to partly because it be such wonderful place to live somerset be now pioneer the first new council house in generation in part of the county many of they zero carbon we welcome the policy change on renewable energy and the extension in the transitional arrangement although urge the minister to consider in exceptional circumstance six month transition rather than three month know that member on several benches wish to see that on behalf of their authority trust in the planning system like trust in politic be not where it should be as with bypassing planning committee impose housing number on council take decision out of the hand of elect councillor and local people which be undemocratic we would reverse that trust in planning demand that people know that our most precious green space be fully protect every authority should have the same level of green belt protection plus precious green wedge and green space in their area rather than whitehall diktat plan for new home should be lead by community and our council and those home should be genuinely affordable to local people council such as eastleigh have show that where those new home come with job school and public transport community consent follow we will not solve the crisis in care for example unless we have the home for old and vulnerable people support by the gp surgery and care service they require if any target be to be mandatory therefore it should be our country need for new social home per year and for low cost home ownership through option such as rent to buy to give people real foot on the ladder that should be fund from capital borrowing just as labour governments and historically liberal government fund our stock of council house in the past include the use of compulsory purchase before conservative government sell they off hand over fist until soon there will be almost none leave top down planning diktat risk surge in speculative greenfield permission of the kind that the minister be concern about for home that be out of people reach instead let we fund incentivise and focus on the social and affordable home that we need zero carbon home that tread lightly on the land restore nature and in do so restore trust in local people and the councillor whom they elect to take the decision that most affect they and their community be not sure detect question there but there be several point will endeavour to respond to at least few of they welcome the hon gentleman broad support for the framework and in particular for renewable energy deployment on the charge that we be bypass local democracy and local community refute that entirely we be encouraging in the way that the previous government do the adoption of up to date local plan that be the good mean of shape development in any particular part of the country that be where local people and community can get involve to determine what development look like and where it go but it must be conversation about what development look like and where it go rather than whether it happen at all under the current system as result of the nppf change in december and the fact that we have less than third up to date plan coverage there be too much speculative development outside of plan which community be rightly take issue with on social rent home as have say to the hon gentleman previously until he come up with less vague way of fund social rent home we simply can not take the point seriously the liberal democrats get away with have no housing spending total in their election manifesto applaud the ambition but we take more realistic path to boost social and affordable home put forward only what we know we can deliver within the spending constraint that we face lastly absolutely agree with the hon gentleman that we need to reform how cpo work we be take forward the discretionary power to disapply hope value that the previous government take through commend they for do that in the levelling up and regeneration act we need that power test but we need to go far and we intend to do so in the forthcoming planning and infrastructure bill follow year of neglect indifference and at time downright obstruction by the conservatives housing in newcastle be the no issue that constituent bring to and my inbox be full of heartrende story of family unable to put roof over their child head therefore welcome the statement and look forward to work with newcastle city council to build the home that my constituent need so much will the minister explain in bit more detail how he will ensure that these home be of the quality that my constituent deserve and that the necessary infrastructure particularly school will be build alongside they my hon friend be right the conservatives can try to scrub the record all they like but it speak for itself the so call planning concern group in the last parliament persuade the previous government to make change to the national planning policy that allow local area to plan for few home than their target require that have lead to rush of plan come in under number some of which we will have to undo through change in the framework as have say we be make target change to the framework to support the delivery of infrastructure provision the government also support essential infrastructure especially in the area that be most unaffordable through range of spending programme on infrastructure lead development and quality support by our framework change in the presumption for saleable development we be determined that there be not rush to million regardless of what the unit look like they must be well design quality unit with the infrastructure amenity and service that community need in order to thrive call gagan mohindra member of the select committee as the minister will know three rivers district council which have be control by the liberal democrats for many year do not have an up to date local plan and there be already presumption for development what would the minister say to council that either choose not to have local plan or be unable to meet the housing target the hon gentleman point be well make we be determined to drive up the coverage of up to date local plan we want universal coverage that be the way to secure sustainable development in which community can have confidence because they have be able to shape it when area refuse to engage we will take appropriate action today we be set week deadline for local authority to give we timetable detail how they intend to put local plan in place through various measure relate to the transitional arrangement and how the new six year housing land supply will bite we think we can incentivise authority to come forward and put those plan in place where they do not do so however we will not hesitate to use the full range of ministerial intervention power at our disposal the last government introduce deadline and let they slip repeatedly but we will not make the same mistake we will ensure that up to date local plan be put in place so that we end the speculative out of plan development that as say community across the country be rightly take issue with call joe powell another select committee member welcome the statement and especially welcome what the minister say about affordable home give the dismal number that be provide under the conservatives those million people on the waiting list deserve voice in our planning system too and only wish the opposition would recognise that what approach will the minister take when there be multiple local plan for example the london plan and the london borough plan how will the target be work out between those different plan as my hon friend may know the new method produce figure for london of nearly that be more than double recent delivery and it constitute the big propose percentage increase against delivery in any region in the country by significant margin we expect london to step up and improve its housing delivery record as for my hon friend specific question it will be for london and the mayor to consider how the aggregate local housing number be distribute across the whole of london because there be spatial plan in the form of the london plan the target for individual london borough need to be view in that context the same can not be say for other part of the country call another member of the select committee nothing in this statement outline the new power for council to build development infrastructure include road school and gp surgery before new housing what power will my local council of broxbourne and east hertfordshire get to build development infrastructure before these massive housing target be force upon they local authority be already require to put in place plan for infrastructure delivery and to set out how that infrastructure be fund and should come forward we have make number of target change to the framework today to support the delivery of infrastructure that will not be not the last word on our reform to the housing and planning system and we be consider what more we can do to ensure that we get infrastructure for development up front in the way that community want one in four bark household be privately rent which be high than the national average and of resident be homeowner which be below the national average the number of people in temporary accommodation be through the roof because of the housing crisis my constituent will welcome the government step to address the housing crisis viability and land value consideration often hold up shovel ready development scheme which then can not be build the six infrastructure commitment that the government have make since the general election be critical can the minister give assurance that the government will deliver infrastructure to ensure that land value increase viability be meet and home can be build my hon friend make good point viability be stall development in lot of area in the country we need to look at what support can be put in place for particular scheme our new home accelerator for example be provide planning capacity support and other form of support and at why some scheme particularly consent or near consent large scheme be be hold up as have say before in the house we be give further thought to how we examine these issue and to what more we can do to ensure that consent scheme be build out in good time this centrally drive intervention drive coach and horse through green belt area such as aldridge brownhills and through local democracy how will the minister ensure that local community be respect and have voice so that we build the right home in the right place return to point that have make several time during this statement the onus be on local community and elect leader to put in place up to date local plan that shape where development be to take place know from previous conversation with the right hon lady that she want brownfield first development so do we we have put in the framework publish today number of target change to support the delivery of brownfield site we have also consult through work paper soft consultation on proposal for brownfield passport to far accelerate and fast track brownfield development local area can look to bring forward and densify brownfield site however in response to the point that there be not enough such site or that community can not work across boundary with neighbouring authority we be say please look at the release of low quality land within the green belt salute my hon friend energy for and commitment to these target it be great to see that they be support by the prime minister the environmental audit committee be look at the new planning framework and its environmental consequence be pleased that since the original consultation there have be change to strengthen environmental protection can my hon friend say little more about how he will ensure that nature be not the victim of his passionate commitment brownfield site be often very biodiverse and try to achieve the biodiversity net gain alongside all the other commitment simply mean that they be not profitable how will he ensure that those site can be bring forward viably by both the private and public sector thank the chair of the environmental audit committee he be right we have make number of change to the framework to far strengthen reference to climate mitigation and adaptation we have make number of other change relate to flood risk and sustainable drainage system and how we can support those through the planning system on bng specifically be more than happy to have detailed conversation about our thinking on how to successfully roll out bng across the country and ensure that it work not just on large site but on small site in particular in his statement the minister refer to the undermining of the capacity of our great town and city to realise their economic potential do he not realise that by effectively absolve the mayor of london of his housing responsibility he be exacerbate the problem of inner london borough such as lewisham and dare say greenwich and woolwich use the green field of kent as dumping ground for their housing problem we be fight rearguard action to protect our farmland from development in the interest of our countryside and more importantly perhaps of sustainability he refer to brownfield site what he have announce today be the undermining of the secretary of state right to rule finally on planning issue after they have be to the planning inspectorate she will now have no credibility at all have lot of time for the right hon gentleman but think that sort of hyperbole be beneath he if may say so we be not absolve the mayor of london of his responsibility the previous government put in place system whereby the arbitrary urban uplift apply not merely to the core of city region as it do in every other part of the country but to every london borough that produce fantastical figure that be completely divorce from reality we have abolish that urban uplift and reset the standard method that still leave london with an incredibly stretching target of home per year which be more than double recent delivery we want to work in partnership with the mayor of london but we will be push he to increase his ambition for what can be achieve in london and his delivery we place great importance on agricultural land and food production the national planning policy framework remain clear that where significant development of agricultural land be demonstrate to be necessary area of poor quality land should be prefer to those of high quality those protection remain in the framework rise order thirty five colleague be bob but the question and answer be get long can we please keep they short on the wirral our housing shortage leave thousand on waiting list the issue go far with child and grandchild have to leave the area to get on the housing ladder we want to build quality affordable house in the right place we share the government approach to building on brownfield first so what step can the department take to support wirral council in achieve that refer my hon friend to my previous answer on our target change to the framework to strengthen expectation around brownfield development we be in the early stage of consultation through the work paper on proposal for brownfield passport and we be explore how we can go far to prioritise and fast track the development of that land we absolutely want to work with local area to look at where brownfield site might be densifie and at how we can get the majority of development through that route where possible refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests mid sussex district council have local plan and it be well advanced in make its next local plan which significantly have cross party support from conservative green and labour councillor we also have design guide and be deliver house year include social and affordable home last year we be an example of what good planning look like we be even purchase our own temporary accommodation invite the minister to come to mid sussex and see for himself what good planning look like think yes or no will suffice minister be afraid that can not give either madam deputy speaker but will add the invitation to the list of request for visit that receive from member across the house however commend the hon lady local authority for its focus on quality and good design we want to see more of that across the country declare my interest as vice president of the local government association welcome the commitment to overall house building target we can not hit national target with clear local target welcome in particular the commitment to social housing will the minister confirm that that mean social housing not the affordable housing that the shadow minister mention there be big difference there the viability of brownfield site be low and section contribution will be low so if we be to concentrate on brownfield site will the minister make the point to the chancellor that to deliver social housing in the number need she might have to reconsider the amount of social housing grant that she provide my hon friend have real expertise in this area we be make distinction between social rent home the most affordable type of affordable housing and other and we have seek to express that through change to the glossary in the framework that separate social rent housing from other form of housing he be right that brownfield delivery involve additional challenge we be very cognisant of those and we be explore how the variety of government fund that support the delivery of brownfield site might be improve as we go forward the minister have allude to one of the challenge with planning permission namely that on any one day there be something like million unbuilt permission for new housing developer ration the supply in order to keep the price high so will he consider as think he do in opposition the principle of use it or lose it at the moment developer will get permission which be repeatedly sell on until viability mean the site can not be develop if the planning permission be either bring forward or lose if they be not use in time we could get the house and home that people want the hon gentleman like my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts have great expertise in this area he will know that local authority already have power to issue completion notice to require developer to complete stall development to bring great transparency and accountability to this area we seek to go far by take the necessary step to implement build out reporting assure he that be give lot of attention to what more we might do on build out because developer have make commitment to increase the pace of build out across the country we need to make sure they follow through with that with an example of short question call barry gardiner congratulate my hon friend the minister on his statement and in particular on the importance he place on the presumption in favour of sustainability and get the design of development right my hon friend be champion for the natural world and be aware that he be sympathetic to the need to include biodiversity measure in all new build such as swift brick which be an essential nesting habitat for the survival and recovery of cavity nest bird will he provide this much need boost for decline population that have sadly be place on the critically endanger red list will he ensure that these simple requirement be not only in the nppf but be translate into the national development management policy to ensure they have statutory weight my hon friend will be pleased to know that we have add text to the nppf to encourage the incorporation of feature to protect threatened specie include swift but also bat and hedgehog we will consult on the ndmp in the spring of next year the town of wimborne in my mid dorset and north poole constituency have double in size with new home build on three side right up to the stour these home be pretty much out of reach for local people and they come with no infrastructure shop be suppose to be include in one development but the developer claim it could not get they fill so now we have another care home meanwhile aldi have make planning application for green belt site to which everyone will need to drive what can the minister do to force developer to deliver the infrastructure they promise so that developer can not play the system there be measure in the framework that will help to achieve the objective that we both seek the government be also commit to strengthen the exist system of developer contribution so that we hold applicant to the promise they make as part of section agreement while arm council to well negotiate with they in the first place bournemouth christchurch and poole council submit its draft local plan for examination in july but under the new target it have plan for only of its housing need can my hon friend elaborate on the step the government will take to work with local authority area at this stage to make sure they fill that significant gap in the formal government response to the consultation which will be publish at the end of this statement we set out very clearly how we be deal with local authority at an advanced stage of plan preparation both those that will meet the regulation stage requirement and those that will not and how we will help those with up to date plan to top up their housing supply so that they come close to the new standard method share my hon friend wish that her local authority take step to close the gap will the minister reaffirm the principle of infrastructure first in order to get home build in tendring and colchester we be plan to build home border community project but it can go ahead only if the be complete and it have to be fund support that objective but gently say that the previous government have year to address concern in this area remember repeat call from conservative members at the time that the previous government should get serious about this we will there be measure in the framework that support infrastructure delivery but there be more work to do welcome the minister statement last week meet my constituent mr anwar hussain who live with his wife and five child in two bedroom house doctor have tell he that his eight year old autistic daughter need her own bedroom mr hussain tell that he have be on emergency banding for large house with more bedroom for two year and he be still wait do my hon friend agree that we desperately need to improve our social housing and can he please confirm that the government plan will help people such as mr hussain that question sit slightly outside the framework although as say there be target change to support the delivery of new affordable home my hon friend be absolutely right that we have to do more about the decency of the exist social housing stock we will be consult on new decent home standard in the new year as well as introduce awaab law to clamp down on the most severe hazard labour new housing target for harborough be increase and the target for oadby and wigston have double yet we can see that the overcrowding problem be bad in urban area and the gap between population growth and housing growth be bad in those area too we can see the environmental argument too however the minister have announce today that the new target for london be about low than the old one in the original round of number nottingham be down birmingham and leicester be down and coventry be down can he tell what the number be now for those midland city be they all still go down even as the target for harborough oadby and wigston be go up think the hon gentleman slightly misunderstand the situation for urban authority the housing target be go up across metro area what about the city have be very clear about this we have drop the arbitrary uplift introduce by the previous government which bear no relation to housing need metro area target be go up the hon gentleman will find out from the specific target which have be produce by our redistribution of the formula within that envelope what the new number be for his two local authority listen to the minister on the radio this morning and listen to his statement and welcome his comprehensive step to tackle the housing crisis while work with colleague across the house opposition member know that think the shadow minister speech be beneath he it be the kind of gutter politic we should not be engage in as we seek to tackle the crisis we must do thing with people not to they gently say to the minister that communication and engagement will be vital to get this right invite he to confirm from the dispatch box for constituent in newcastle under lyme that productive agricultural land will not be the default in his brownfield first approach to development as make clear in my response to the shadow minister our approach to agricultural land remain the same ours be brownfield first approach we want to maximise delivery on brownfield first wherever possible only when that type of delivery can not come forward where brownfield site can not be densifie or where cross boundary strategic co operation of the kind we intend to introduce be not possible will we ask local authority to review their green belt with view to identify and release the low quality most poorly perform land within it the hon gentleman be thoughtful and diligent minister who share my disdain for the identikit soulless ubiquitous housing estate that have be build during his lifetime and mine welcome the nppf commitment to design code that provide local framework for create beautiful and distinctive place will he write to every local authority to make it clear that design be key planning determinant and be absolutely salient will he also write to the planning inspectorate to ensure that when local authority turn down an application on the basis of poor design the inspectorate will back they up well design place remain at the heart of planning policy as the right hon gentleman will know an entire chapter of the nppf remain devoted to well design place the change we be make to the presumption today will ensure that when it come to national policy on design those expectation need to hold in the balance of decision that the planning inspectorate make there be much more we can do outside of policy in the new year my department will bring forward update to the national design guide and national model design code as part of those change we will make clear our expectation about what local authority can do to improve the quality of design call chris curtis who should have call early as member of the housing communities and local government committee my apology that be okay thank you madam deputy speaker thank to the failure of the conservative party over child will be wake up on christmas day in temporary accommodation if that be record to be proud about have absolutely no idea what would make opposition member feel any shame may get two reassurance from the minister first business need certainty so will he assure that we will not see the chopping and change we see from the conservative party and that we will stick by the policy secondly the issue be not just about the planning rule but about capacity in our local council so what will he do to speed up the process of get more planner into our local council to add capacity to the system we need consistency in national policy we have too many change to the national planning policy framework under previous government we intend this to be the big change in term of substantial policy development there will come point next year when we will look to consult on ndmp and we will have to make change to the framework to account for the evolution of those as say today statement set out the big change we intend to make and we want they to hold and to be deliver through this parliament on local planning capacity and capability make reference in my statement to the million of funding that be be inject into the system in particular as part of the transitional arrangement to help local authority that will fall foul of the requirement set out in the new framework today as former house builder know some of the challenge about viability welcome the minister and the government focus on affordable housing target and viability assessment but there be basic mathematical calculation about affordable housing of something be well and more than of nothing the hon gentleman make somewhat cryptic statement perhaps the point he be drive at be relate to golden rule one of the change we have make that put pragmatism above purity be drop the straight requirement across the country and look at how we can get more locally sensitive rate by put in place percentage point premium on local affordable housing target in the round we think that will provide more certainty and maximise the delivery of home come through that route refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests cherwell district council housing waiting list quadruple over the past decade under the conservatives which be why commit to my constituent in banbury during the general election campaign that would make address the housing crisis priority we all recognise that planning reform which the conservative party duck during its time in office be crucial to fix the housing crisis but do the minister agree that it be also crucial to help we get the growth that we want in our economy because it be good for business whether they be sandwich shop or high tech engineering firm across the country my hon friend be right that the situation we be in with an acute and entrenched housing crisis and an ail planning system be not just blight life but hold back our economy and the way our great town and city can maximise their potential this be growth focus national planning policy framework and we be very proud of it order unless question be keep short colleague will not be able to get in so think about everybody in the chamber know that the minister be man of considerable integrity so can he be honest with my constituent about the fact that the combination of mandatory target massive increase in those mandatory target and the fig leaf of the grey belt policy mean that in constituency like mine which be almost entirely green belt apart from that which be develop on there will be massive new development an expansion of london sprawl and change in the character of the area forever thank the right hon gentleman for his compliment at the outset of his comment do not agree with he for the follow reason we be not abolish the green belt but preserve it we think it have play hugely important role over recent decade not least in check unregulated urban sprawl on his constituency say to he gently that do not know how he can know the definition of grey belt when we have just publish it he do not know how much grey belt land there be in his constituency but in part of the country like his the answer lie in cross boundary strategic planning so that we can sensibly plan for housing growth rather than every local area have to account for those number on its own as have already be mention there be million people on the social housing waiting list and there will be kid in temporary accommodation this christmas but the number of under who own their own home be half what it be in the last generation do the minister agree that it will take serious and sustained action over the course of this parliament and beyond to turn that around my hon friend be absolutely right contrary to the crowing by the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake about the opposition record on home ownership the rate be stagnant and they be particularly bad for the young generation we have generation lock out of home ownership we be take action in that area not least through our plan to take forward comprehensive and permanent mortgage guarantee scheme one of the large contributory factor although not the only one at the heart of why housing be unaffordable be our failure over many decade to build enough home of all tenure go forward the framework will support our target of million new home the government have announce that housing target for reigate and banstead will increase significantly we will move from an advisory target of house per year to mandatory and completely unrealistic target of increase large proportion of my constituency be green belt if all area must play their part in build the home we need why be the minister reduce housing target for london and other urban area while increase they in rural area like mine have make clear the point on urban area and how the increase across the board mean we be ask more of all part of the country say gently to the hon lady that she speak as if there be no housing pressure in her constituency people want home in her constituency to rent or to buy as much as in any other part of the country yes the target be stretch but they be achievable either through brownfield development from the release of low quality grey belt land within the green belt or through cross boundary strategic planning represent large and rural constituency be constantly contact by family who be concerned that member of their young generation be have to leave northumberland to find the home they need that be just one example of the conservative party war on the countryside will the minister confirm that the new framework be the only way that we can get the home that be need and one that be appropriate into our rural community so that generation be not force out of rural britain my hon friend be absolutely right to be clear the reform to the planning system that we be make today be not the only part of the answer delivery of home be an entirely different challenge from bring forward planning permission we need to over supply planning permission into the system to get the number of home we need in his constituency and across the rest of the country write to the secretary of state in november concerned about the impact on local authority such as south gloucestershire that be at an advanced stage of bring forward plan to deliver much need home welcome the extension of the transitional period but remain concerned that area whose figure have increase will be vulnerable to planning by appeal while they get the new consent line up will the minister explain how authority that be do the right thing will be protect from their strategy be wreck by speculative application while their plan go through the process for adoption gently say to the hon lady that the expectation of have an up to date local plan in place be nothing new authority have know for some time that they should be do that it be failure of the previous government that they do not use the power at their disposal to ensure there be more up to date local plan coverage those area that do not have up to date local plan in place will be vulnerable to development take place outside the plan process but we be commit to support those who share our ambition and be work in good faith to get plan in place to be able to do so can the minister set out how today announcement will help our small and medium sized enterprise house builder market and bring forward more site suitable for sme to develop there be more to be do in this area and sme and small site can make huge contribution to the million home target there be change that have be publish today in the framework that will help sme builder not least the focus on tenure site that we know build out fast and where sme can play big role go forward the minister intend to impose thousand more house on my constituency when there be already not enough school place not enough doctor and congested road will he at least look at way in which financial arrangement can be establish that would mean that developer can be make to fund necessary infrastructure ahead of house building and sale rather than wait for month and possibly year after completion as have say we be give considerable amount of thought to what more we can do in addition to the change be make today to ensure that the right infrastructure come forward be happy to give the right hon gentleman point serious consideration the minister know because we have discuss this before that my constituency of dartford be already get on with the challenge of build new home ebbsfleet garden city the first garden city in hundred year aim to build new home over the next decade with new park and open space as well as network of green corridor be delighted that the minister have confirm he will be visit shortly what more can we do to up the level of affordable and social housing in new development like ebbsfleet so that everyone have the chance to live in they look forward to my visit to ebbsfleet which be now build out at fast rate than it be we welcome its contribution have already reference the change we intend to make to strengthen the exist developer contribution system to get more out of section agreement there be more we can do in that area and of course through government investment in affordable housing we will bring forward more detail in the spending review next year my constituency of cheltenham be already build up to its boundary and be work with its neighbour on the joint local plan reference by the minister in part to deal with housing waiting list of more than bequeath to we by the last government we also have big sprawl town centre and plenty of empty space what be the minister message to council that have that combination of challenge be pleased that the hon gentleman area be work in co operation with its neighbour as he know we have in place duty to co operate it have not be particularly effective and we think we need to go far on strategic cross boundary planning to those part of the country that wish to densify their town centre we fully support that and be open to any conversation in particular area about what more they think need to come forward to allow they to bring forward plan to rejuvenate town centre and bring more residential development back into they he be always slightly out of my eyesight but call martin vickers in reply to an early question the minister speak of streamline the planning system in my year as councillor and year in this house have hear successive government talk about streamline the planning system by which they mean take more central control it result in frustration among ward councillor frustration among their constituent who feel that they be not able to participate properly and frustration for government because in effect they fail to meet their target as be sure this government will do the minister accept that one way of involve local community other than in the local plan be to allow local councillor to work close with their community and have some influence over individual major development in that case we would have well quality and the government would meet their target lot quick where appropriate local councillor with advice from train planning officer should of course have say on major outline application some of the proposal we be ask for view on we be ask for nothing more than view at an early stage on work paper be about ensure we get plan officer take the right decision use their expertise with member focus on the large and most controversial development do not know if the hon gentleman have ever sit on planning committee but can he say hand on heart that every reserved matter application as technical as some of they can be should come to full planning committee we think there be way to streamline the system that do not involve the removal of local control and that adhere to the plan lead system philosophy that we be take forward and value very much thank the minister for his statement across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we clearly have an age population believe there be desperate need for dedicated apartment for those in the age group which would free up home as well as social housing back into the market will the minister consider have discussion with colleague in the cabinet and suggest the northern ireland assembly to secure funding for the complex that be need not only in town but in rural area the previous government as the hon gentleman may know again commend they for it appoint an old people housing taskforce to look at option for the provision of great choice quality and security of housing for old people that taskforce recently publish its report with series of recommendation that we be engage with however we need to give serious consideration as to how the planning system evolve to take into account demographic change that we know we need to adapt to may suggest to the government that this subject really warrant full day debate and not just statement with question and answer for now however may ask about one straightforward matter will the minister look carefully at the relatively small number of place include east hampshire with planning area that be part in part out of national park and at the case that housing target should be set separately for those two part of the planning area the right hon gentleman raise very important point there be local authority around the country where the boundary be such that they stray into area where environmental protection be in place such as national park and other thing local area will need to engage with the mandatory high housing target that we be bring forward when come up with local plan those local plan will be test by the planning inspectorate to see whether there be hard constraint of the type he speak to and therefore whether plan be sound on that basis hard constraint will still be take into account in the development and examination of local plan in an early answer the minister confirm that the government support an infrastructure first approach will he work with colleague in the treasury and the department for transport to ensure approval of west winch housing access road funding which be essential to unlock thousand of home that be in the local plan on the edge of king lynn the hon gentleman request have be put on the record and will make sure that my ministerial colleague be make aware of it call the ever patient ben obese jecty the prime minister and deputy prime minister today launch the nppf in my constituency of huntingdon at alconbury weald however that development be plan and build under the previous government and phase and will see furth home and significant brownfield development at scale but it have nothing to do with the revise nppf it be shame the deputy prime minister do not travel the extra couple of mile down to the envar medical waste incinerator approve by the minister on her behalf against local wish couple of month ago the minister talk about guarantee infrastructure when ask the government about new east coast main line station to support the home at alconbury weald they fob off with talk of an internal review how will the nppf unlock the infrastructure that large development desperately need refer the hon gentleman to my previous answer on that point order the minister have be in the chamber for well over an hour he will no doubt recognise the strength of feeling towards this subject because it have take so long to talk about build home will give member on the front bench short moment to swap over very quickly for the next statement qualification reform review with permission madam deputy speaker will now make statement on the outcome of the review of qualification reform at level the priority for this government be to build skill system that will drive forward opportunity and deliver the growth that our economy need the skill system in england that we inherit from the previous government fail both of those test in particular the qualification landscape be too confusing and fail to provide the clear route to success that be need by learner and employer we hear strong argument that the previous government plan to remove level qualification and to limit the flexibility for school and college mean that they risk leave student with too little choice and too few opportunity this year we have pause the defunding of qualification and have undertake review of the qualification that be set to have their funding remove to see where we need to retain alternative qualification such as apply general qualification or btec and to consider how long we need to keep they in place we undertake extensive stakeholder engagement delve into the detail of qualification with employer representative body college practitioner award organisation and industry expert we recognise that certainty be very important to education provider to student and to their parent and guardian reassure the house that our decision make the position clear up to we be clear that student deserve high quality qualification that meet their need and that we must continue to develop and improve qualification so that they provide for the need of student and employer the curriculum and assessment review will take view on qualification in the long term as part of its wide consideration of how we prepare all young people for life and work but there be some area where we need to act in advance of its recommendation the first change that we will make be that we will not tell provider and student which type of qualification they can and can not mix together it should be for college and sixth form to work with student employer mayor and high education to devise the good mix for each individual and deliver the skilled young people that their local economy need we will therefore not be apply the previously propose rule of combination there be confusing number of qualification in the system and through this review we have already identify more than qualification with low or no enrolment we will remove funding from these in line with already publish date this give student and employer simple range of qualification to choose from level provide an excellent qualification option which should be available to more learner we introduce three new level this september and further level in marketing be to be introduce from september it be fantastic to see the energy generate by this year level week which highlight the huge benefit that young people be gain from level and their enthusiasm for the qualification the unique industry placement aspect of level be real draw for student and be all too often not offer by other qualification we have recently introduce new flexibility to support industry placement delivery to enable more young people to benefit from the opportunity that level provide it follow therefore that where learner wish to study large qualification in level route the level should be the main option for they we have move away from blanket restriction such as automatically defunde any qualification that overlaps with level instead we have take practical evidence lead approach look at the qualification route by route this will ensure that we can be confident that student have high level choice on this basis we have conclude that we will not proceed with defunde qualification on publish list in agriculture environment and animal care legal finance and accounting business and administration and creative and design before follow our review we will retain funding for qualification that be due to be defunde by july in engineering and manufacturing we will keep fund for the qualification that be previously identify for defunde until this will allow time to update the occupational standard that be design by employer and that underpin this large and complex route and to establish new qualification that meet the need of learner provider and employer in the digital sector we be work with the level award organisation to make assessment more manageable and plan to have the necessary change in place for the next academic year we be also make level placement more flexible expand the option for remote learning this will be particularly important in the digital route we will keep funding for the six exist large digital qualification until to allow time to embed these key improvement beyond that we will also keep fund for small digital qualification so that learner have range of choice until reform alternative be available on health science and social care the previous decision to defund social care qualification leave gap as there be heavy level focus on health and science rather than on social care we will therefore keep fund for nine qualification in health and social care until new qualification in the care service route have be develop we expect that to happen in we be also keep funding beyond that for qualification in science relate subject to give learner even more option on education and early year we have hear strong support for the level and so we will remove funding from exist large and medium qualification as plan in this will direct learner who want to study large qualification to the level as the high quality option we be also retain funding for six small qualification to support specific occupation such as teaching assistant give learner small alternative construction be key part of this government mission and be delighted to report that two of the construction level continue to grow and offer high quality option for learner the on site construction level be also provide valuable education industry experience and positive route into employment for those who wish take it however its success have be limit because of lack of overall demand for large qualification at level we have as result conclude that the need of learner and the economy be well meet through apprenticeship and other classroom provision and decide to cease take new enrolment for the on site construction level those already take it will be able to complete it as plan and progress into positive destination post graduation to meet the economic need of this important sector and to ensure that we can support our mission around high quality housing we be also keep one large qualification in site carpentry and in other medium and small qualification we must continue to improve opportunity and the quality of qualification we will keep qualification only until they be no long need so that learner can do the level that they need to do we will invite award organisation to submit further new level qualification in the spring to continue the process of reform we be currently consider whether propose level in catering and beauty therapy meet the need of learner and the economy and we will update the sector in due course can confirm that any new level in these area will not be roll out until at least these change be fair reflection of what we have hear and offer balanced approach that support our mission of spread opportunity and support economic growth we want high quality option strong choice and simple system that be easy for learner to navigate the approach and timescale that have set out today represent pragmatic and achievable journey to where we want to be we be put the need of learner and our economy at the heart of how we move forward commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of the statement for many year people have worry about the huge number of different qualification in further education for many year people have want we to be more like germany and call for new high quality higher fund simple qualification level introduce under the previous government be an attempt to do exactly that with high unit of funding and much more work experience finally we have clear prestigious qualification mirror level on the academic side as the minister will know from talk to lord sainsbury part of the vision be to use level to simplify the landscape which everyone agree be too complex think the sector will heave sigh of relief that today announcement be finally out we be get to the point where literally any decision would have be well than continued indecision but it leave some huge unanswered question the minister say that thing will be clear up until in other word we will be back here again in two year we have pause and review we will now have long pause and another review at some point the government will have to decide the sector want certainty but we know from the statement that it will not get that yet the government must spell out some kind of vision for how they plan to simplify the landscape of qualification which for my whole lifetime everyone have agree be far too complicated and fragmented the minister say in her statement that the qualification landscape be too confusing even as she announce that the government have decide to keep more qualification particularly overlap qualification do not want to be too mean to she these issue be not easy in government we have the wolf review more recently we remove further qualification that have sustain low take up but what be this government vision to simplify the landscape never mind the detail what be the rough vision and when will they set it out if it be not level and what the previous government be plan to do what be it there be also lot more work to be do to improve level as the minister say the government will allow part of the work experience to be deliver work from home but we need much more than that what be the plan to reduce drop out rate and make level more appealing and easy to deliver one of the great thing about level be the need to produce so much work experience about more than previous qualification that make they much hard to deliver what be the government do to help college to deliver they on point of process the government extraordinarily think refuse to publish the term of reference for the review that have just conclude even in response to freedom of information request from fe week will the minister agree to publish the term of reference now that the review have conclude there be no reason for they not to be in the public domain no qualification structure will work unless the review get the funding landscape for technical education right so will the minister set out the funding implication of her announcement the government promise that they would protect public service from the national insurance increase but first university and this week nursery and early year provider have discover that that be false promise the university fee increase have be entirely eat up by the increase in national insurance now early year provider say that the failure to compensate they for the national insurance increase be catastrophic and will mean that countless nursery pre school and childminder will be leave with no option but to raise cost reduce place or simply close their door completely so far the government have refuse to come clean about the cost to the further education sector of the national insurance increase piece of information that this house deserve to know the government have it but they will not release it when staff in non academise college complain about their different treatment on pay compare with academise college the government say that there will be million for education but they will not say how much of that will be eat up by the increase in national insurance hope that today the minister will finally give this house the information that it deserve to know the government have the information and this house and people in the sector deserve to know it it be early day but what we be look at be ongoing uncertainty over these qualification no clear vision to bring about the simplification that the government say they want and no proper plan yet to support level student and provider the house be not allow to see the term of reference of the review that have just conclude or know how much the national insurance increase will cost the sector for student and teacher alike we have to do well than this thank the shadow minister for his many point the reason the review be so pertinent and need to take place be because of the confusion around level and how much work need to take place work that the conservative government have lot of time to do this government believe that level be an excellent qualification that should be available to more young people qualification that overlap with level will be able to co exist while we continue to develop and improve qualification so that they provide for the need of learner and employer and support the transition to level as the large technical qualification of choice the conservative government rush plan would have leave young people look to move into crucial sector such as engineering or social care without option instead of blanket restriction the review will deliver on the government ambition to fix the foundation of the economy and deliver growth as the shadow minister mention level be still in the early stage of implementation and the retention rate be improve we expect that trend to be maintain as they continue to bed in career guidance for potential student be key and we be raise career adviser awareness of the benefit of level the shadow minister will be aware of the announcement in the october budget of million of additional revenue funding for further education and million of new capital investment that settlement reaffirm and expand the government commitment to skill by provide an additional million for further education to ensure that young people be develop the skill that the country need in addition the government have provide million of new funding to support college to maintain improve and ensure the suitability of the fe estate and address condition and capacity issue we will set out in due course how that will be distribute there be many area in which the government be make advancement and we be very aware that student need to be support combination of learn be absolutely the right thing for they we remain ambitious for student will endeavour to get back to the shadow minister on the term of reference call the chair of the education committee pay tribute to everyone who work in further education vital sector that make transformative difference and whose importance be often not properly recognise vocational and technical course and qualification be critical part of our education system yet school college and student have face great uncertainty as consequence of the previous government decision to defund number of apply general qualification welcome the additional certainty that the minister have provide by commit to maintain some agq and pause any further change until the landscape of vocational qualification be indeed too complex and confusing but the cliff edge approach adopt by the previous government have significant adverse consequence my committee have hear evidence that the previous government plan have already have material impact because some college have model the propose reduction in course and now face potential insolvency as result what support will the government provide to college that have already plan and commit to their qualification offering for september base on the previous government decision to defund and now face further change the committee have also hear evidence of the success of level for those who complete they particularly in area such as healthcare however level account for just of all vocational course and continue to have worryingly high drop out rate what further work be the government planning between now and to reform level and make they accessible to wide range of student include student with special educational need and disability before any further change to agq be make my committee understand the value and potential of level but it be vital that in pursue this route as the predominant option for technical and vocational training the government be not lock some young people out of the opportunity to learn succeed and thrive join the chair of the education committee in praise many college the sector and teacher themselves she be right to mention the track record of the previous government we very much want to support student in their learning and especially college where college find that they have to change course or where there be issue with course invite they to make that know to the department to see what support can be provide the million that have be invest in this area should go some way to provide it level need much focus through positive communication and we need to ensure that young people enrol in the right course there be series of event and webinar to inform school college and other professional work in educational setting about the outcome of the review the department will publish further information advice and guidance in relation to study programme in the new year call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of the statement in the year since the conservatives first botch move towards prematurely scrap range of vocational qualification the liberal democrats have repeatedly warn of the consequence of that ill thought through counterproductive policy so it be to be welcome that the government have hear our and the sector concern the announcement be welcome step forward to protect student choice and local decision making and it be more pragmatic rather than ideological approach it be clear that the decision to defund be premature level while welcome innovation have not have enough time to bed in to allow an informed decision and that risk too many young people be leave without appropriate option now the government be provide clarity up to will the minister lie out the process for monitoring and review the impact of those change until then will she lay out the timeline for the long term curriculum and assessment review in great detail have one particular area of concern in the statement and that be around early year education research last year show that rather than embrace the level in education and early year student overwhelmingly opt for the overlap qualification earmark for defunde now we hear the government will go ahead and proceed with that defunding give that reality how do the announcement square with the government focus and rhetoric around prioritise early year how will the government improve recruitment and training in that sector if it be not meet student need where they be the point be reflective of broad question on the announcement which be what be the government overarch guide principle as to which course will be fund and which will not the rationale lay out by the minister suggest they be work on case by case basis but in the interest of long term stability and clarity should the government not be lay out their principle for how they will approach those decision more strategically finally as student face welcome range of option as we have hear it be confusing landscape it be essential that they have excellent support in make those important decision how will the government ensure that all student have access to high quality career guidance thank the hon member for the many point she make and for acknowledge the government pragmatic response it be recognise that the previous government be not focus on social care and childcare so we need to relook at those area and ensure that level and level placement be available she will be aware that we be conduct the curriculum and assessment review and the qualification reform will be connect to the wide review which will be publish next year there be various other way that qualification reform be be monitor in term of the national audit we be review the process on an ongoing basis as well as see where the uptake be from student this be where skills england will come into play we be look at ensure that organisation and employer be involve in the type of training and course available for young people so the connection be very much there we will follow through with more detail in due course the certainty that the statement provide will be an early christmas present for the further education sector last month visit bracknell and wokingham college fantastic fe provider in my constituency where student learn everything from green construction to nursing electric car maintenance to career guidance which show the breadth of opportunity available through the fe sector incidentally those be all skill that will underpin the government mission the fe sector be vital not only in break down barrier to opportunity but as vehicle for growth provide the green skill that be necessary to our economy and to support those mission what more support can the government put in place for the fe sector in particular around the difficult issue of pay settlement for fe teacher thank my hon friend for highlight the many important contribution of the fe sector pay be not currently set by the pay review body include for fe and the government do not set recommend pay in further education with that say my noble friend the minister have full knowledge of the need and crucial role of the fe college sector when the minister other noble friend the distinguished labour peer lord sainsbury conduct his landmark review of technical and vocational qualification he find that they be not only multitudinous and heavily overlapping but have become divorced to large extent from the very sector of industry that they be suppose to serve the overhang qualification reform be massive power grab that the new government be carry out create body call skills england and abolish the independent institute that oversee technical education standard skills england be not even separate body it be part of the department for education management structure under the legislation go through parliament the secretary of state will take to herself the power to oversee standard in technical education that would not be acceptable for level so as ask in westminster hall the other day how can it be possibly acceptable for level what do that say about this government commitment to parity of esteem will ask my noble friend the minister to get back to the right hon gentleman on that point may make correction to what say in my statement qualification in agriculture environment and animal care legal finance and accounting business and administration and creative design will not be defunde before not be minded of that old adage suppose be old enough to remember all these thing that when you ask fish to climb tree it do not make the fish stupid it just can not do it my concern with the qualification review be that we will not have the breadth of scale that allow for student choice and accessibility and it will try to pinpoint people into role that they can not be successful in how can the minister ensure that those gift in academia will have that clear path and those gift with job skill will find their place as well alongside those still search for their calling who be look for wide subject to keep many door open for their future we be keep of the course that be outline to be defunde that will be review on an ongoing basis depend on uptake our focus be very much on economic growth and our mission be for growth and ensure that young people have opportunity in level and other qualification to ensure that they be able to get the job that be desperately need in our country we be not remove the rule of combination more variation should support to year old to have access to the job they wish to do in the future official report december vol correction prison capacity strategy before we come to the statement on the government year prison capacity strategy note that it be publish yesterday the day after justice question in the house this timing be unfortunate as publish it day or two early would have give hon member an opportunity to put topical question to ministers on the new strategy so be very pleased that the minister have come to the house today to make statement thank you madam deputy speaker and hear your comment with your permission will make statement on the year prison capacity strategy and annual prison capacity statement that the government publish yesterday as the house will be aware publish these document make good on pledge make to this house by the lord chancellor in july when she come before the house to set out the emergency measure that we be force to take to prevent our prison from fill up entirely let begin by set out some context on prison place as right hon and hon member will be aware on december the national audit office publish scathing report increase the capacity of the prison estate to meet demand that report be unequivocal in its criticism of the previous government approach to the criminal justice system include their failure to deliver on their commitment to build additional prison place by the only additional cell be add to the overall stock of prison place while the previous government continue to promise prison place there be significant delay to project in some case they run year behind schedule and failure to address rise demand have leave the system thousand of place short of the capacity it require the expect cost of the ministry of justice and his majesty prison and probation service prison expansion portfolio to build the additional place be currently estimate to be billion to billion at least billion high than the estimate in the spending review carry out by the previous government none of this be reveal by ministers at the time it only come to light when the government be elect in july of this year it be now clear that even the original commitment be not sufficient to keep pace with the expect demand on prison place accord to the last government own projection this put the viability of the entire system in jeopardy have we run out of prison place police would not have be able to make arrest and court could not have hold trial it could have lead to total breakdown of law and order in our country with all the associate risk to public safety that be why we be force to take emergency action release some prisoner early than they otherwise would have be in most case by only few week or month that buy we precious breathing space but if we do not act our prison will fill up again we must therefore act include by build more prison place as matter of urgency integral to our plan for change be ensure that we have the prison place we need to lock up dangerous criminal and keep the public safe the year prison capacity strategy set out how we will deliver that the strategy be detailed set out our commitment to build the place that the last government fail to deliver as part of their prison place programme with the aim of get that work complete by it far set out what we will do where when and how we will build new prison and expand exist one through additional houseblock refurbishment and temporary accommodation the strategy be also realistic as the house know prison building be an extraordinarily complex and expensive undertaking in particular the planning process to get site approve for development be complicated and time consume that be why our delivery plan include contingency prison place which will provide resilience in our building programme should project become undeliverable or provide poor value for money that can not be take forward we be also ambitious the strategy set out how we will work with the ministry of housing communities and local government to streamline the delivery of prison supply include important reform to the planning system and deliver on our commitment to recognise prison as nationally important infrastructure it be also this government ambition to secure new land so that we be always ready should further prison build be require in the future we be committed to improve transparency now and in the future as such when parliamentary time allow we will legislate to make it statutory requirement for the government to publish an annual statement on prison capacity like the one we have publish that annual statement will set out prison population projection the department plan for supply and the current probation capacity position it fulfil our transparency commitment for and crucially will hold we and future government to account on long term planning so that decision on prison demand and supply be in balance and the public be no long keep in the dark as they have be about the state of our nation prison finally we be be honest with this house and the public about what must happen next build enough prison place be only one part of much wide solution as the government have already make clear we can not simply build our way out of these problem in the come year the prison population will continue to increase more quickly than we can build new prison that be why in october we launch the independent sentencing review chair by the former lord chancellor david gauke alongside panel of expert include the former lord chief justice lord burnett that review will take bipartisan look at an issue that have be political football for far too long punt about by both side the aim of the review be to ensure that we be never again leave in position where we have more prisoner than place available it will help we to ensure that there be always prison place for dangerous offender that prison help offender turn their life around and bring down reoffende rate mean few victim and that the range of punishment for use outside of prison be expand the review will make its recommendation in the spring the government look forward to respond as quickly as possible so that we can begin to implement any necessary policy change urgently when this government take office just five month ago we inherit prison system on the brink of collapse instead of dither and delay we have take the difficult decision necessary to stop the criminal justice system from grind to halt altogether which could have lead to total collapse of law and order in our country however this be not an overnight fix and the journey ahead of we be long this year prison capacity strategy and annual statement along with the independent sentencing review be critical step on that journey the last government leave our prison in crisis put the public at risk of harm we will fix our prison for good keep the public safe and restore their confidence in the criminal justice system commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of her remark also thank you madam deputy speaker for call out what be quite obviously an attempt to avoid scrutiny this week also thank the chair of the justice committee the hon member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter for his effort to ensure that we have proper statement today begin by make one thing absolutely clear if labour mp think that spend the next few year talk about our record in government be go to stop this opposition from hold they to account they be dead wrong there will be no free pass for they on these benches it be already clear to the british public why the government desperately want they they be flounder and they know it say to the minister that will happily spend all day compare record of government and inheritance labour mp and the minister decry our record of have have to release prisoner early but the last labour government release not just or even prisoner early by the end of their time in office they have release prisoner early that be the state of the system when labour be in charge and that do not even include the systematic erosion of the punishment element of our justice system bring about by labour introduction of blanket halfway release for essentially the entire prison population labour do not call it early release but that be what the british public know it to be that be the record of the labour government that we have to try to turn around be proud of the fact that we begin to unpick that record by reduce early release for the most serious offender from halfway to two third and that we introduce whole life tariff for premeditated child murder and increase maximum sentence for child abuser and other let we be absolutely clear the root cause of the problem that we now face be spike in the remand population we have approximately more people in prison on remand than we normally would that unprecedented spike have occur as direct result of covid and the government know that will the shadow minister give way no you can not give way on statement in fact prior to covid we have get the crown court backlog down to low level than it have be under the last labour government another record of which we can be proud to try to tackle the problem we increase sit day and introduce nightingale court and contrary to what the government have say we be clear that we would carry on do everything possible to bring that number down we do not refuse the judiciary extra sitting day as this government have do nor would we have refuse they we have agree floor on sit day not cap and negotiation be ongoing if the judiciary have come to we and ask for more sitting day we would have respond to that and not by say no which be what this labour government have do in the prison population estimate that sit alongside this plan be the proof that the government truly have already give up on fix this problem not only do their projection not target the remand population be bring down but they show it go up which mean more victim wait for trial and more prisoner release early we should be build more prison space and under our leadership we actually increase prison capacity at the fast rate in live memory that be not so we could accommodate more people on remand but so we could go even far in ensure that offender be properly punish and victim get justice the government want to talk about the last year but be afraid this plan leave ask what they be do for those year they come into office tell the british public they have it all work out what have they do on sentencing they have ask someone else to do review what have they do on how we prosecute murder they have ask someone else to do review what idea have they come into office with for tackle the court backlog absolutely none today as the minister know we have simply have reannouncement of our plan prison building programme with four new prison all of which be already announce or under way before labour take office this be not bold new strategy it be continuation of work start under the conservative government there be of course some important question for the minister first give that we do not do so why have the government refuse additional crown court sit day to the judiciary secondly why do their prison population figure project an increase in the remand population thirdly give that they be commit to build more prison space whatever the sentencing review say they will have to decide that they can not park responsibility with an independent review will she commit to continue our programme of increase the amount of time that the most serious offender stay in prison fourthly miss from the prison population figure be any transparency at all about the number of foreign offender so what be their estimate for the foreign offender population in our prison in future year the government blame we for their early release but the situation be nothing compare with the scale of the early release they themselves oversee when they be last in office they release prisoner they should not have do they botch the legislation and have to come back to this house to correct it they let people out without tag who should have be tag and they have give up on fix the fundamental issue of the remand population the leader of the opposition have say that we do not get everything right in government and she know there be no easy answer to these challenge only trade off however this government be make it clear and clear how not to do it and we on these benches will be there every step of the way so that the british public know exactly that yet again zero humility from the people who put we in this crisis it be absolutely staggering to think that that be what the opposition want to tell the british people there be no apology for the crisis they leave we when we take office in july we be just day away from complete collapse of our criminal justice system because of the inheritance we receive from the previous government the fact be that this government be take action we have increase crown court sitting day there be more to ensure that we have capacity in the system and magistrate sentence power have be increase from six to month free up more day in the crown court be glad the shadow minister mention foreign national offender because like he believe that we need to be do more to deport the foreign national offender in our jail however there be difference between he and because this government be actually do something about it less rhetoric more action we be on track to deport more foreign national from our prison than at any time in our recent history since come into office this government have deport more than foreign national offender which be more than at this time last year and who be the immigration minister then oh that right it be none other than the shadow secretary of state for justice himself if it be that easy why do he not do it after year in government this government be take action to ensure that we have criminal justice system that be fit for purpose call the chair of the justice committee welcome the prison capacity strategy give the crumble condition of much of the prison estate it be right that the government be press ahead with the delivery of modern prison also welcome the explicit linking of this strategy to the independent sentencing review and the recognition that without change to sentence policy prison could be full again in year time which would mean extend early release do the minister agree that long term reduction in prisoner number in way that good protect the public require strategy for rehabilitation to reduce reoffende and when will the government share their proposal for achieve that thank my hon friend the chair of the justice committee for his question be aware that the lord chancellor be due to give evidence to his committee next week and be sure she will outline those step in more detail the capacity strategy that we have publish be just one step in our plan as well as go forward with build more prison we need every single element of our justice system to be work and that include the independent sentencing review we look forward to the recommendation come next year so that we can take they forward and we never have to be in this position again we look forward to set out our plan in due course call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of the statement and thank the chair of the justice committee the hon member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter for the point of order that think help to bring the minister to the house with this statement today year of neglect under the previous conservative government have leave our prison overcrowded and unequipped to provide the tough rehabilitation require which have let down victim and survivor in my patch and across the country in fact as recently as this week the conservative opposition let down those victim and survivor by vote against the measure to exclude people such as stalker and murderer from the early release scheme the result of the conservatives incompetence be the scheme the standard determinate sentence early release scheme which have see thousand of ex offender release early to unlock emergency prison place the minister know my concern about that scheme particularly in relation to domestic abuse and hope she will support my proposal to patch it up will she however confirm what the criterion will be for review the scheme next year ultimately liberal democrats believe that we need sustainable solution to tackle this problem because more prison mean more offender more offender mean more victim and more victim mean more failure with of people in prison be reoffender we know that reduce reoffende must be the key know that from have spend my career before reach this place support kid out of crime and gang so why in prison capacity statement of over word be reduce reoffende mention just once will the minister reaffirm her commitment to that effort and can she provide more detail on how she will reduce reoffende to protect victim and survivor across this country thank the liberal democrat spokesman for his comment and he be right to raise the issue of reoffende it be important to note that we have prison capacity available to protect the public to lock up high risk offender and to ensure we have public safety measure available but we obviously see tackle reoffende as serious priority we be look at it across government and pull every lever available to we every department must come together to tackle it and part of that be the independent sentencing review as he know full well however when we have prison population that be run at boiling hot we can not get into our prison and do rehabilitation work yesterday be really pleased to visit his majesty prison downview and see the vital work be do with the woman in that prison which be really important to achieve rehabilitation on the outside prevent reoffende and protect the public on the hon member will know that we have to take immediate action within day of come into office to protect the public and to ensure we have place in our prison to lock up high risk offender and keep the public safe legally we could only exclude offence not offender and we do introduce wide set of exclusion than under the last government early release scheme all offender release under the scheme be on licence and be subject to recall we be work to ensure that we never again get into the position of have emergency release and that we have prison place available and can work on rehabilitate our prisoner so that they can serve vital role in society call justice committee member alex barros curtis thank you madam deputy speaker be just go to refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests be qualified solicitor and be also member of the justice committee under the excellent chairmanship of my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter thank the minister for the statement and the commitment she have make must admit that my head be still spin from the extraordinary response from the tories spokesperson the hon member for bexhill and battle dr mullan give their absolute failure over the last year to build the prison place that they legislate for so we will have no more of that hypocrisy welcome the publication of the year prison capacity strategy which know the justice committee will scrutinise carefully concerningly however it note that we could run out of prison space by as early as november aside from the finding of the independent sentencing review when they come what other step do the minister anticipate the department take to bridge the potential gap in prison place my hon friend will know that we be strain every sinew to ensure we get this right this be whole system approach justice be system and we need every part of it to be work for it to work correctly my colleague the prisons minister in the other place be due to visit texas to learn from the interesting model there where offender earn time off their custodial sentence for good behaviour texas have cut crime by third we be also look at new advance in technology to see how they could help for example in singapore artificial intelligence combine with surveillance camera monitor offender and spot moment that could escalate into violence that be also be do in the netherlands lot of option be available to we the other thing we be do in the immediate term be increase the sentence power of magistrate court from six to month maximum imprisonment for single triable either way offence that will also help we to bear down on the large remand population by ensure that those on remand be sentence far more quickly this strategy do little more than commit to deliver the place that the previous government commit to deliver except that it will cost more and take long to what extent have the government factor in optimism bias when work out the delivery timeframe honestly the display from the conservative party be staggering give the inheritance we be leave with and there be still no humility whatsoever we have publish realistic strategy for how we plan to deliver this with contingency timeline build in offer real solution as say this be less of the rhetoric than we get from the conservative party and more actual action on deliver these place you fail to the conservative party fail to build these place but we be go to deliver they exactly the minister know that you would refer to and that would not be appropriate the conservative government dereliction of duty mean that they fail to deliver promise prison place which expose the hypocrisy in any conservative claim to be the party of law and order welcome the new government year prison capacity statement do the minister agree that publish an annual statement on prison place will allow transparency accountability and affirm that labour be the party of law and order could not agree more the labour party be be honest with the public about the situation that we inherit we be publish our plan to be transparent about how we will deliver and we will commit to do that annually to ensure that the public be never again leave in the dark about the state of our prison since this government introduce their early release policy we have see criminal who should be in jail out on the street enjoy themselves with champagne with one even thank the prime minister personally instead of let those dangerous people out of jail it would be much well to sort out the remand backlog and the increase of in the number of prison place take up by people on remand instead the government be cap the number of sit day the minister say that the number of sitting day be adequate at what point will the number of prisoner in our jail wait on remand be return to the pre pandemic level what be the date by which that will be achieve have outline the action we be take to tackle the remand population in our prison we be deal with the inheritance that we receive from the previous government we have increase crown court sit day and increase sentencing power for our magistrate court we will publish our plan in due course and we be be transparent with the house the lord chancellor will be in front of the justice committee next week and be sure she will be happy to answer those question then have listen to some of the contribution from conservative members can not quite believe my ear they be come to this place and suggest that they should be proud of leave this government justice system with few than place in man prison across england and wales would well response to the statement not have be much simple one word answer sorry my hon friend hit the nail on the head sorry seem to be the hard word for the conservative party this government have start as they mean to go on that be why within the first six month we have already deliver nearly place and pledge to continue build the remain place of that place prison building programme we have also launch the independent sentencing review in parallel with our year prison capacity strategy that review will ensure that sentence deliver well outcome for prisoner and protect the public and that we will always have space to lock up dangerous offender the minister like to talk about inheritance but if she check the record she will discover that prison overcrowding be high in and than it be in it be true that we bring back long sentence for the bad offender that be the right thing to do it be also true that crime come down there be two enormous area that the minister need to work on or perhaps should say continue the work we be do in government one be the population on remand and the length of time people spend on remand the other be at different point in someone sentence and the length of time they wait for parole board hearing we need more capacity to replace the old capacity with new prison which be more conducive to rehabilitation and to get people on to stable path and into work welcome the minister continue with the previous government programme just hope it be more successful than when gordon brown government try to build the titan prison if they have be build we would not be have this conversation at all believe the right hon gentleman be the prison minister in the previous government so he will know all too well the impact that this situation have have yet they fail to build the amount of prison place we need and there be no apology yet again to the british public for the crisis we have inherit we need resilient and function prison estate to ensure that prisoner have the opportunity to be rehabilitate as the right hon gentleman say we be tackle our remand population increase the sentencing power of magistrate and build those new prison place he mention as say we be take action and deliver on our promise whereas the previous government fail to deliver the minister be aware of my view that it be folly to build new prison to increase capacity all we will do be create more prisoner and more overcrowding it be supply lead industry will she confirm what new idea will be incorporate into the new prison rehabilitation not incarceration be the key to address criminality the hon gentleman make valid point we can not build our way out of this problem and the prison population will only continue to increase more quickly than we can build new prison that be why the year prison capacity strategy be just one part of that prolong solution the second part be the independent sentencing review which we have outline focus on prevent reoffende be crucial to this government mission to build safe street for example the government have commit to halve the prevalence of violence against woman and girl and halve knife crime within decade and will work closely with ministers across government to ensure that we deliver on those bold ambition lgbt veteran etherton review beg to move that this house have consider lord etherton independent review into the treatment of lgbt veteran in july last year lord etherton report on lgbt veteran shine much need light on dark period in britain military history an era between and when lgbt people be ban from serve in our armed force an era when homophobic bullying harassment and abuse be widespread an era when lgbt personnel be demote dismiss or drive out of the force because of their sexuality the testimony of those who give evidence to lord etherton review and who have courageously campaign for justice be truly harrowing the very value of tolerant western democracy that we expect those force personnel to defend be deny to they it be profoundly wrong have be determine as defence secretary that we will continue the work of the previous government to deal with the injustice suffer by so many lgbt personnel be grateful to lord etherton for his work and for his report be grateful also for the support of fight with pride and the coalition of more than charity that back its work be grateful to they for provide the government with invaluable guidance and advice on range of restorative action some of which be able to announce today be also grateful for the very small team of official who have work from the outset within the mod on this area be grateful too for how members from all part of the house have come together to recognise the injustice and to support the action that first the previous government and now this one be willing to take this be unfinished business for labour we lift the ban in we argue for the etherton review in the armed forces bill in we welcome the etherton review recommendation and publication in opposition we call on the previous government to deliver on the previous defence secretary pledge for debate in this house to as he say make sure that the house properly debate the report and the government response to report july vol today this government deliver on that commitment and it be an honour for as defence secretary to open the debate in do so will update the house on the action we be take as new government to right the historic wrong to lgbt veteran first among the remain recommendation make by etherton can announce today that we be establish financial recognition scheme when that scheme go live tomorrow it will mean that almost all of the recommendation make by lord etherton will have be deliver recommendation and in his report specifically refer to financial award tangible payment to reflect government accountability and our determination to recognise these historic failing be pleased to announce today that we be launch an lgbt financial recognition scheme with total budget of million that be high than the level recommend in the etherton review and the cap set by the last government this financial recognition scheme will open tomorrow one year to the day since the previous government respond to lord etherton report the scheme provide two type of payment to recognise the discrimination and detriment suffer by lgbt personnel under the ban the first be for those who be dismiss or discharge it will be available to veteran who be dismiss or administratively discharge include officer instruct to resign because of their actual or perceive sexual orientation or their gender identity under the ban the payment will be at flat rate of the second be for those who be impact in other way this lgbt impact payment be open to all those who experience pain and suffering under the ban include harassment intrusive investigation and in some case imprisonment the impact payment will be assess by an independent panel with tariff range between and to make the award fair and proportionate to each individual the two payment will run concurrently as part of single financial recognition scheme we have also set aside funding from the mod to support those charity that can advise applicant on the scheme as result of the additional funding we have allocate payment can reach up to maximum of for those who be most impact and most hurt and who qualify for both award the scheme will remain open for two year and application for payment from the scheme from terminally ill veteran will be prioritise all payment from both scheme will be exempt from income tax and will not affect benefit that applicant may receive the scheme will open tomorrow morning and full detail will be online at that point hope that our decision to listen to the view express on the last government plan to uplift the value of this scheme and to deliver it within one year of the recommendation be accept demonstrate our profound regret and our determination to do right by our lgbt personnel today can make three additional important restorative announcement first those who be administratively discharge base on their actual or perceive sexual orientation will be able to apply to get their record set straight as result the ban will be show as the reason for their discharge finally remove any blame or dishonour on their record for those who have serve secondly we will restore the rank of veteran who have they reduce as result of the ban ensure that they regain the rank they rightfully earn in service thirdly while not within the scope of lord etherton review which cover the ban between and we also want to acknowledge any lgbt veteran who serve before and who may have suffer under the ban we be take further action to recognise their service and contribution as result these veteran can now apply to have their administrative discharge qualified their rank restore if it have be reduce and their certificate of service reissue former officer may also apply to have their service detail publish in the gazette as part of the official record work on these restorative measure and meeting affect veteran have not be easy but they have show how much progress our modern armed force be make there have be change in culture and change in prevail attitude and britain military today be more inclusive and more tolerant than in the past each of the service have hold presentation ceremony to welcome lgbt veteran back into the family where they have always belong while there have be change and there have be progress there be no place for prejudice in the modern armed force we still have more to do to reinforce zero tolerance of any discrimination or abuse anywhere in defence have constituent who be not member of the armed force but member of the secret service he lose his job in the because he be gay there be no compensation for he at the moment suspect it may not be the responsibility of my right hon friend but do he not agree that there should be parity of treatment across the force we rely on our secret service as much as we do our armed force surely what be fair for they should be fair for those who have give their time and risk their life in the service of our country my right hon friend make the powerful point that this discrimination harassment and abuse systematic in some case be not and be not confine in the past to the military that concern have be raise by civilian at time within the wide defence field and ministers in this team be as concerned about it there as in the military but think she will appreciate that we ask those who put on uniform for our country to take on special role to step forward and to be willing to give their life to defend the rest of we when those basic value that they fight for and that our country stand for be deny to they as part of their service that be deep injustice and lord etherton report give we the basis for recognition and restoration that be the focus of my concern in this debate in september the minister for veterans and people my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak al carns and be proud to present the first etherton ribbon to veteran as way of acknowledge the mistreatment of those affect by the ban the government be deliver for defence and deliver for lgbt veteran be intervene on my right hon friend because have to chair westminster hall in an hour so can not take part in the debate my constituent not only lose his career in the royal air force but be subject to abuse when he be arrest include constant internal examination he be beat he be kick and he be spat at he be march across the parade ground to his billet where his personal belonging be go through he be humiliate be that sanction by the ministry of defence at the time be it sanction by senior officer or be those individual work on their own they act like sadistic animal towards my constituent something need to be do to investigate that my hon friend have be one of the most consistent and forceful voice on this historic abuse and demand for the government now to provide some justice he have raise that case in this house before do not know whether his constituent give evidence to the etherton review if he do he would have be one of over individual lgbt veteran who serve and have story to report to etherton often of the sort of abuse that my hon friend talk about it be base on that experience that etherton make his recommendation it be base on those recommendation that we make these announcement today it be from tomorrow that we will open the scheme to start assess and then make payment that recognise that injustice thank the secretary of state for make really passionate speech my constituent ed hall who be in the gallery be one of the found member of the legal campaign to lift the ban ed be sack from the royal navy for be gay in and found the first legal challenge group in when meet he he speak about people who have be investigate about humiliation and stigma and about people who be sack many be make homeless simply because of who they love and their sexuality will the secretary of state join in commend my constituent ed hall for his tireless work it have help to deliver justice today for so many veteran and which be as ed have say close to the shameful chapter in recent british military history my hon friend make moving and powerful intervention although courageous relentless energetic group such as fight with pride have in many way lead the charge that be open up by the stance of courageous individual such as her constituent who have suffer but be prepared to speak out about their experience which give voice to the experience of many more the whole history of social change and progress in our country be base on brave individual who at the outset will not stand for injustice will not stand for that sort of harassment and will speak out they start the movement that can bring pressure on government and other to change the case that she cite stand for number of lgbt veteran people who serve this country and be not serve well by our military at that time hope that her constituent and her constituent family will welcome the announcement and hope that they will be able to take advantage of the scheme that we will open up tomorrow welcome the tone and tenor of the secretary of state speech wonder if he could assist the house in set out the step that the government intend to take to ensure the reliability of gather datum about the size of the cohort who be affect and may be eligible for the compensation scheme the hon gentleman make sensible point the shadow defence secretary will know he and his colleague start this work before the election that one of would argue the strength of the announcement and the scheme we be able to put in place today be the close work we have do with veteran group and fight with pride as well as with historian and those with access to record to make our good assessment of the number of veteran who may be affect and may be eligible and may therefore want to take advantage of these financial recognition scheme we have set the budget for the scheme and set the level of award in the light of they we will see how that go wholeheartedly welcome the secretary of state announcement and in particular the additional fund find to support charity who will help lgbt veteran with their application one of my constituent write to with most harrowing story about how his career in the armed force end with an investigation by the royal military police he say that every aspect of his life have be greatly affect since the initial investigation with his housing employment health and family life all have suffer as result of the ban which be rule illegal in will my right hon friend outline when eligible lgbt veteran impact by the ban can expect to receive their financial recognition they can expect to be able to get the full detail from tomorrow they can expect to be able to complete the detail and respond to the information require from tomorrow be conscious that for many of these veteran time be tick and be determined that the scheme will not take long to make its proper decision therefore soon into the new year lgbt veteran who be confirm as eligible should expect payment look forward by the way to the large number of contribution that there will be in the debate as wind up want to emphasise two or three point this be government deliver for defence this be government deliver for lgbt veteran on behalf of the government want to apologise without reservation for the pain and injustice cause during this dark chapter of our armed force history the treatment of lgbt veteran be moral stain on our nation it be shameful that those who put themselves in harm way to defend our country be treat in such callous and unjust way our government will now right those wrong of the past that be why we be provide financial recognition to veteran it be why we be make sure that payment will be fair proportionate and prompt and it be why we be deliver on the remain recommendation of the etherton report we will learn the lesson from that report we will never forget the pain and trauma that lgbt veteran be subject to between and we will root out any remain prejudice and abuse wherever it rear its head in the force and we will look to build more diverse strong military that well reflect the society that it serve and protect military in which everyone can serve without fear injustice or discrimination that be the one nation mission that the government be commit to modern representative unified armed force proud to keep britain secure at home and strong abroad call the shadow secretary of state let start by sincerely thank lord etherton and his team for undertake this hugely important review commission under the previous government and take forward by the present one as in any such situation the financial quantum will come under scrutiny but the opposition recognise that the million announce today be above lord etherton recommendation and we support and welcome it in my ministerial and shadow role this be the first time that have speak on the issue of homosexuality in the armed force not have have responsibility for veteran at the ministry of defence regard it as great personal honour to stand here and put on record my reflection as shadow secretary of state first recognise the terrible pain humiliation and degrade treatment experience by far too many people who simply want one thing to serve their country secondly alongside the secretary of state echo the previous prime minister my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak and the former secretary of state ben wallace in apologise unreservedly give our position as party in government for significant part of the time that the ban remain in the military long after the law for the rest of the country have change thirdly ultimately this be about recognise that the value of freedom patriotism and public service be not confine to any part of society but be common to all we stand strong as nation and our armed force be well serve if we recruit every talent from every possible walk of life lord etherton have shine bright light on shameful historic wrong and be grateful to everyone who submit response to the call for evidence appreciate that for every person affect that would have be very difficult dare say traumatic it be right that on the day that lord etherton report be publish in july last year at prime minister question my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton say that the ban be an appalling failure of the british report july vol early this year veteran from bailden in my constituency contact victoria serve in the woman royal army corps but be dismiss due to her sexuality she be subject to imprisonment and mistreatment which many would consider abuse as result victoria have suffer from post traumatic stress disorder for over year welcome the government commitment to raise the compensation fund to million for veteran such as victoria be pleased that the hon gentleman support that and ask he to join in welcome today historic announcement which complete the important work that the conservative party begin when it be in government to deliver on the recommendation of the etherton review victoria and all those with first hand experience or anyone who have read the testimony or receive constituency correspondence such as that mention by the hon member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford will know how harrowing and horrific those experience be they be at the front of our mind as we debate this subject join the hon lady in welcome what the government have announce today as the report make abundantly clear the ban on lgbt people serve in the military see brave service personnel face awful sexual abuse violence harassment and bullying lord etherton report also find that invasive investigation undertake into individual sexuality cause long last and severe impact for some it find that many veteran subject to the ban develop mental health issue include ptsd and experience difficulty with their employment finance and homelessness as we have hear they find it hard to form long term relationship due to shame and trust issue and perhaps inevitably some turn to alcohol and drug compound that due to an absence of transition support many veteran feel isolated tragically the stress cause by the ban mean that we have lose lgbt veteran to suicide and other have contemplate it when meet campaigner be strike by particularly powerful point what they want most of all be to feel full and equal part of today veteran family as house know we speak with one voice in say to everyone affect you be as much veteran as anyone else who serve this country the financial package announce today will not undo the past but it mean that both party in government have take significant step to deliver redress important progress have be make in recent year to improve the experience of lgbt personnel particularly in term of training the home office disregard and pardon scheme be set up to ensure that those who receive conviction for same sex sexual offence can have that conviction wipe the office for veterans affair award last year to lgbt organisation to provide support service for impact veteran that be on top of the provide in to help organisation gather evidence for the review in office we launch the etherton review and accept the intent behind each and every one of lord etherton recommendation we be commit to implement they in good time we set deadline and make good progress and we will support the government as they conclude that work we understand that of the recommendation have be deliver the veterans minister be welcome to correct in his wind up but be sure that we would all welcome his provide clarity on the timeline for deliver the remain recommendation for all the work of the previous veterans minister my right hon friend the member for south west wiltshire dr murrison it be never go to be straightforward come up with deliverable package of financial compensation as my hon friend the member for solihull west and shirley dr shastri hurst say in his intervention there be the crucial issue of gather datum which be complicated that be so welcome the two pronged approach to the scheme and in particular the fact that payment will be exempt from income tax although believe that mean that the timing be link to the passing of the finance bill my understanding be that those affect will be able to apply under the dismissed or discharged payment scheme from tomorrow but inevitably the impact cohort will take long due to the involvement of the independent panel urge ministers to keep we post on how the scheme work in practice as the secretary of state say time be tick and we all want to see this resolved and money award as soon as possible we fully support the plan to restore rank and amend official reason for discharge and ask the minister to clarify when those affect will be able to ask for that to take place finally pay tribute to the many colleague who have campaign on this issue with passion and persistence and to those in the last government for their work get we here particularly ben wallace johnny mercer and the previous veterans minister my right hon friend the member for south west wiltshire finally pay tribute to craig jones caroline paige and ed hall of fight with pride for their extraordinary effort to campaign raise awareness and deliver this change they have help to ensure that tangible righting of deep wrong be now happen in practice underscore the equal place for people of all background in our veteran community and our armed force rise order as member can see large number of speaker wish to contribute to very important debate have no plan as yet to impose time limit but perhaps member might be respectful about the number of intervention they take warmly welcome today debate and thank the defence secretary and the veterans minister for the way that they have go about this work with lgbt veteran and charity such as fight with pride and build on the work of the previous government know that the defence secretary and the veterans minister care deeply about this issue the defence secretary rightly say that this be unfinished business for labour and the veterans minister assure when first raise this matter with he many month ago that the scheme would be up and run by the end of the year we can put that under the promise keep part of the government record and be grateful for that this be profound injustice and moral stain on the nation as the defence secretary rightly say few moment ago thousand of servicemen and woman over many decade be interrogate persecute and punish for their sexuality people who only want to serve our nation but be let down in the most profound way constituent of mine in brighton kemptown and peacehaven tell that he feel wash in shame at the way he be discharge imprison and discard by the raf despite his exemplary service record thousands more veteran fall into that bracket some of whom we have already hear about this afternoon and hopefully we will hear more about those people lose their career their pay their pension and often their family and friend but also as the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge say their sense of self value and belong the emotional psychological and physical impact be still be understand that be the central point of this debate and the injustice we face how do we ever go about rectify something on such scale hard still how do we put value on it and process around it thank lord etherton for his work on this issue over many year and recognise that the defence secretary and veterans minister have work incredibly hard to build on the work of the previous government to deliver this hugely welcome financial recognition scheme which will be set up tomorrow know it will be welcome by veteran in my constituency and other across the country will do everything can to encourage the many lgbt veteran in my constituency to apply for it as hope other member will and as know the defence secretary will welcome the increase in funding that have be allocate increase be not insignificant this be significant commitment from this government and it be welcome also welcome the creation of two clear funding scheme first for those with formal discharge and dismissal secondly importantly for the many who never suffer that discharge and dismissal but who suffer much wide loss emotional financial and physical as many member have speak about as the defence secretary have say it be also incredibly important that the option of restore rank and remove the record of discharge have be bring forward point raise by many lgbt veteran have meet in my constituency surgery and around brighton kemptown it be in some sens as important as the financial measure announce so welcome that too however if may be so bold would also welcome clarity on couple of point first what estimate have the ministry of defence make of the number of people likely to apply for each of the two tranche under the scheme secondly what estimate have be make of what the average payment be likely to be no two case be the same as the defence secretary say early of course the headline figure of be very welcome but how many people do the secretary of state believe will ever receive that how many be likely to fall into those two tranche would welcome some clarity on that thirdly how do the secretary of state respond to the concern that by keep hard cap on compensation albeit significantly increase one many applicant will ultimately receive quite low sum particularly give the level of injustice that we have all state fourthly will he explain why there be two year cap on application and what the government will be do to ensure that all who be eligible will come forward and will be able to apply as we know and as we have all hear from look at this over many month many people be only just willing to come forward on this issue it might take much more time to reach the many people who have suffer this injustice be slightly concerned about that cap and would welcome some clarity on it be conscious of time madam deputy speaker know there be lot of work to do to get these scheme up and run and to get the compensation out as quickly as possible today be an incredibly welcome step on that journey as we have hear it have be very long journey for many people decade in the making and time be run out to deliver justice above all thank those who have make that journey possible especially the extraordinary lgbt veteran whom have have the pleasure of meeting in the past five month and fight with pride which have do so much for so many to achieve the progress we be discuss today before call the liberal democrat spokesperson will just make the point that it be imperative that member be present for the opening statement of any debate if they wish to be call perhaps particularly so for those on the front benches we be here today to discuss the implementation of the recommendation lay out in lord etherton independent review into the treatment of lgbt veteran follow the unjust and appalling treatment of veteran who serve in our armed force under the shadow of discriminatory and dehumanising ban it be not just matter of historical injustice but an ongoing fight for dignity recognition and fairness for those who give so much to our country and be repay with shameful betrayal we must also recognise all those who serve before and the injustice they face before that time between and thousand of personnel be dismiss or force out of the military simply because of who they be the anti gay ban have and continue to have an enormous impact on people life career be destroy life upend and future take away veteran be out to their friend and family without their consent face extreme stigma not only do they lose their job but they have their medal remove and be strip of their pension in some case conviction make it impossible for people to move on and rebuild their life due to the barrier criminal record create when try to find employment it be indefensible that those who put their life on the line for our country should continue to be treat with disregard the independent review by lord etherton lay bare the devastating impact of this discriminatory policy on veteran and make recommendation to address those wrong while progress have be make this process be far from complete the government must ensure that all the review recommendation be act on as swiftly and comprehensively as possible let share two harrowing example from constituent of my colleague which illustrate the endure trauma cause by this policy this morning meet michael sansom who sit in the public gallery today who be constituent of monica harding mp he join the royal air force order as front bench spokesperson the hon lady first should be on the bench when be on my foot secondly we must not refer to colleague by name in the house but by their constituency my apology madam deputy speaker michael join the royal air force at just year old fill with pride and ambition and serve with distinction for five year before his life be shatter in after innocently share detail about attend london club michael become the target of covert investigation his barrack be search in humiliating manner expose deeply personal item such as romantic letter he be extensively and inappropriately question about his personal life offer

homeless battle severe depression and rejection from his family despite his immense contribution to lift the military ban michael continue to struggle with the deep scar of his past he now seek justice for himself and other who endure similar horror the current compensation scheme cap at be an inadequate acknowledgment of the profound harm suffer by individual such as michael michael say to that he be proud to serve his country and his country be ashamed of he david constituent of my hon friend the member for guildford zöe franklin also serve in the raf during the fulfil lifelong dream however his career be mar by persistent rumour bullying and verbal abuse despite never be charge he be subject to constant surveillance and intimidation after year endure shame and distress david

year unable to live openly as himself and have face diminish career prospect and significantly impact pension like michael david find the propose compensation deeply disappointing and urge the government to reconsider their approach these story be not isolate incident they represent systematic failure that affect thousand of veteran lord etherton review reveal the immense toll this policy take on mental health with of veteran report that their dismissal impact their mental health and state that their finance have be affect the government have accept of the recommendation make in the review which acknowledge and have also acknowledge the need for compensation be also pleased that the total budget for the compensation scheme have now be increase however the flat cap of for dismiss or discharged applicant be inadequate veteran charity have rightly call it inadequate and unacceptably low for people who lose their career home and future it be small offering justice demand well it be unconscionable that veteran such as michael and david be leave fight for recognition and fairness after already endure so much the lgbt impact payment of between and be also unacceptably low for what one veteran describe as state sanction sexual assault the liberal democrats be unequivocal in our stance veteran deserve full and fair compensation for the harm they suffer we call on the government to reassess the compensation scheme ensure that it truly reflect the gravity of the injustice endure we welcome the four non financial measure outline by the secretary of state today for veteran who serve before but it be vital that all recommendation of the etherton review be implement swiftly and comprehensively include the return of medal clarification of pension right and the establishment of memorial to honour veteran justice delay be justice deny and the government must expedite support for elderly or ill veteran such as joe ousalice who serve with distinction for year but now fear he may die before see justice joe deserve to have suitable compensation swiftly he dedicate his life to serve our country and ask for very little in return this debate also remind we that discrimination in the armed force have not be limit to personnel the atherton report highlight the pervasive challenge face by woman in the military include bullying harassment and sexual assault some of female veteran report experience some form of abuse during their service such systemic issue be unacceptable and undermine the very value our armed force be mean to uphold we must ensure that the recommendation of the atherton report be fully implement and that diversity inclusion and respect become cornerstone of military culture the armed force represent the good of our nation they be make up of individual who have pledge to protect we often at great personal cost for too long veteran be deny the respect and recognition they deserve it be time to right that wrong the liberal democrats stand firmly with our veteran we will continue to fight for fair compensation the implementation of all recommendation from the etherton and atherton report and culture of inclusivity in the armed force let we honour the sacrifice of these brave individual by deliver justice swiftly thank the secretary of state for give an update to the house also thank he for show clear understanding of the hurt and pain suffer by lgbt veteran over the year it be important to acknowledge that no amount of financial compensation will ever wipe the painful memory away however these be clear step towards clean the stain on our nation that these violation have cause as lord etherton say in his independent report the failure to get this right risk prolong the sense of injustice rather than achieve closure this debate of course go beyond financial redress it be about correct an injustice live by veteran who lose their livelihood and their place in society it be about act to repair long last damage that cost many man and woman their physical and mental health it be about give people back their sense of pride and freedom they defend our freedom while we be deny they their own one such individual be constituent of mine whom sit with in november as he explain the very real horror he suffer he join the royal navy in october shortly before his birthday he train originally as naval airman and then later as marine engineer in after three year in service he be accost in the middle of the night by four military police place in black out van and take to the royal navy hospital stonehouse there he be force to strip and be subject to what he call an invasive medical procedure carry out by royal navy doctor in front of an audience of military police this physical abuse be just the start with his uniform give to forensic he be issue dirty dressing gown drive to cell block and place in strip cell he encounter silent guard he be give his meal on the floor he be accompany to the toilet and to the shower the silence continue for three day my constituent be never offer any legal advice nor any legal representation he be interrogate several time by senior official who tell he they see he as threat to other servicemen because of his homosexuality he be tell he would be detain until such time as they believe it safe to release he he be not charge with any offence nor be he aware of when he would be release for day he be consign to strip cell with the light permanently on and with silent guard ban from talk to he during that time my constituent father contact the ministry of defence in london to say that his sister who have leukaemia be now be keep on life support machine his father want to give he his chance to say goodbye but be tell he be at sea when my constituent be release into the custody of the regulate branch of hms drake he be tell his sister have pass away month go by and while not detain my constituent be class as an offender at large on march without warn every available rating and officer not on duty at hms drake be order to gather in the gym alongside other who have also previously be detain for be homosexual he be order to dress in full dress uniform they be then march into the gym there in front of an audience of hundred an officer with sword draw stand in front of he and remove his cap the captain of hms drake read out numerous charge in full graphic detail charge that have never be put to he his description of the shout insult and threat from baying crowd be awful to listen to no attempt be make to silence the crowd he be then dismiss from the service with immediate effect he be hand his civilian clothe and dump on the street of plymouth far from home with to his name the long last effect of that experience be his drug and alcohol addiction plague his life for almost year with vicious cycle of precarious work and unemployment at this point want to quote directly from he carry with sense of great shame for not only be be gay see as criminal still in the armed force but something you be almost force to declare you have be dismiss for from the armed force every time you apply for work far to this spend those year of self destruction believe deserve the treatment receive for have be catch and as such blame myself for the mess my life become only year later have he be able to recover sense of pride self worth and self confidence he subsequently go to university and gain first class honour degree in english literature and creative writing and recently obtain master research degree in english literature both at the university of chester that be just snapshot small part of the physical and mental health impact that the lgbt ban have on my constituent life we have an opportunity to bring an honourable end to this dishonourable attack against member of our own armed force the way lgbt armed force personnel be treat do not reflect today armed force welcome the fact that lord etherton and the ministry of defence have work together with an incredible community of veteran to achieve this announcement today finally urge the government to continue to work with the community to promote the scheme and ensure that every veteran affect by the ban receive the compensation they deserve rise order it might be helpful if provide small business update to hon and right hon member the second debate that be schedule for this afternoon will now not go ahead that give this very important debate the full time up until which will certainly enable to get all member in soon many of we will be hold rapt by television sas rogue heroes which return to screen soon the series will focus on the elite unit as back from initial success in the desert war it face the much sterner challenge of ayrshire where it be briefly base until it go into action in italy and occupy europe with legendary founder david stirling languish in colditz the focus will be on new command officer blair paddy mayne mayne should by right have be decorate with the victoria cross our premier gallantry award for his action rescue pin down troop in oldenburg germany in yet the award be downgrade this be perhaps because of mayne enthusiastic off duty drinking and his penchant for punch senior officer but it might also have something to do with the suggestion that he be homosexual it be quite remarkable that such martial giant should be doom to be the brave man who never win vc over something so entirely irrelevant yet today we must confront the reality that outmoded view of lgbt people persist in the military for far long than they ought to have do nothing can be do now to right the wrong do to blair mayne but the government be address the suffering of people very much alive today take my constituent alan once teenager proud to serve in raf blue he tell arrest for be gay be sexually assault by the special investigation branch and make to endure horrific humiliating treatment during gruelling three day interview as year old kid lose all contact with my family and attempt to take my life five time due to the way be treat the long term effect this have have on my mental health and family connection have not be easy the government be in position to deliver the element that veteran such as both blair mayne and my constituent alan would recognise as vital to all military operation speed as we have hear the clock be tick and time be move on the minister for veterans and people the hon and gallant gentleman who will sum up the debate be no stranger to combat but he may yet find the treasury difficult opponent when it come to the timing indeed he may need the courage of mayne to prevail in that struggle we must all hope that this scheme be streamline and deliver apace in way that the post office horizon compensation system be not thank member on both side of the house for the many compelling and move speech that we have hear so far today when make my maiden speech in this chamber during the general debate on remembrance speak of the bravery and personal sacrifice of all those who have serve and continue to serve our country in our armed force when read the testimony in this review of veteran who have relive their trauma pain and suffering in the pursuit of justice we be once again remind of that bravery and personal sacrifice there can be no doubt in anyone mind that they belong in our armed force and that in ban they we do great disservice to they and to our country the policy of ban lgbt people from serve be rightly refer to as stain on the history of the uk armed force but the evidence of the culture of homophobia bullying blackmail sexual assault abusive and humiliating investigation and medical examination as if be gay be disease to be remedied go beyond mere stain and be at its very mild shameful and reprehensible chapter in our history these be people who want to serve their country and do serve their country yet all that their country serve they be dismiss or discharge they not on the basis of their performance but on the basis of who they be although after dreadfully long year the policy be eventually lift we know that as with many abuse our lgbt veteran the victim of this policy have suffer appalling consequence for the rest of their life that be what make this review and this debate so important we must recognise that these be not dark tale of time go by and that this injustice be still have real effect on people to this very day people like my constituent chris who bravely give evidence to lord etherton review board about his own dismissal in he come to one of my first constituency surgery and move almost to tear and be proud to march alongside he in this year remembrance sunday parade chris serve in northern ireland he volunteer for the falklands he receive an air officer command commendation he gain promotion to corporal on his return to the uk and while originally enlist for six year he have aspiration to serve our country to serve his country for much long however once chris secret be out and after six month of not know what be go to happen to he during which he be place in the psychiatric wing of military hospital medicate daily consider security threat and investigate by the special investigation branch he be dishonourably discharge despite glowing report of his service career he be boot out and leave to fend for himself with no support as he grapple with the rapid transition to civilian life financial hardship and suicidal thought in meeting and correspondence with chris have talk of his pride in be member of the armed force and the love that he have for the air force he have say that when his secret be out it be not just his career that be dash but his life as well that point be important this injustice be not just career setback but something that ruin life and take away time and opportunity that can never be give back while we be thankfully different country today in no small part owe to the last labour government lifting of the ban it be right that we address the wrong of the past and must therefore turn to the subject of compensation no amount of money can undo the wrong of the past but be delighted that the government have announce increase in the total compensation fund from million to million with those affect able to receive up to and flat rate of for all those eligible for the lgbt dismiss or discharge payment veteran who suffer from this abhorrent abuse include constituent of mine who be up in the gallery today suffer the most shocking experience of brutal rape and assault and bravely want their story to be tell do the hon member agree that fund should be allocate among the victim on the basis of the severity of their case as small recompense for the vast horror that they have have to endure and psychologically continue to endure agree with the hon member refer to previous case and the range of amount award the review state an amount which fall below that range risk prolong sense of injustice rather than achieve closure be glad that the government be not take that risk be also glad that government recognise that some veteran impact by the ban be seriously unwell it be right that those individual will be prioritise and that money be be set aside to fund key charity to help lgbt veteran with their application which can be submit from tomorrow however this be not just about money but about pride in service give that many lgbt veteran have their rank take away and be dishonourably discharge wholeheartedly welcome today announcement that rank will be restore and discharge reason amend so that they reflect and honour the service of veteran who be impact finally want to add personal comment as citizen of this great country know that the freedom and opportunity enjoy have be secure by the bravery and sacrifice of our armed force and as gay man know that the right that can almost take for grant be hard fight for and hard won by those who go before who speak up against injustice and campaign for change often at great personal cost and often with the knowledge that they might never know experience or benefit from the change and the future that they spend their life work towards today give we chance to thank both those group and to recognise that they be not distinct but overlapping because there have always be people like chris gay and serve their country chris serve his country with pride at time when his country be not proud to take he for who he be today he can hear his member of parliament and so many other say we be proud we be thankful and we be sorry as have be say today it be almost extraordinary now in to think that for so long the uk armed force uphold ban on personnel the ban allow for the legal discharge of individual from their duty and in some case it mean that people be criminally prosecute veteran be out to their family and friend without their consent force to endure stigma and discrimination they lose their job and have their medal and their pension take from they some be criminally convict simply for be themselves this have make it nearly impossible for they to rebuild their life as they have face significant barrier to find employment and move forward my constituent stephen purves from haywards heath be among the thousand who be so deeply wrong stephen be the last raf officer to go to prison for be gay he serve indeed endure six month in civilian prison and he do so solely as result of be himself to add insult to injury he be strip of his pension he be court martialle and dismiss in disgrace from the raf in he should have receive pension from the age of he do not financially stephen be leave in ruin he have have to work far hard to make end meet ever since that financial insecurity couple with the difficulty of find employment with criminal conviction be just one of the reason he be leave mentally scarred he tell that those scar remain he have be leave to battle with the mental health repercussion of this scandal for decade as well as the obvious and severe stress and strain of the financial situation that he be leave in he have endure stigmatisation isolation and social exclusion it be indefensible that those who serve our country and put their life on the line for our safety and freedom be treat in that way my liberal democrat colleague and be commit to ensure that veteran receive the justice that they deserve that absolutely include guarantee fair compensation for every affect veteran welcome the increase compensation announce today but be sorry to say that do not think the maximum award of be sufficient give the other compensation scheme announce by the government include for the post office horizon scandal do not think that that compensation be sufficient for someone like steve who lose his career and his liberty who go bankrupt and who suffer to this day urge the government to go far in the age my constituent robert move from scotland to sunny weston super mare to pursue bright career at raf locking which be then vital part of the raf technical training radio and radar network however not long after move to weston robert be question by the special investigation branch about be practise homosexual very soon after that his career in the raf be over and the shame and embarrassment cast long and powerful shadow over the rest of his life robert be unable to return to scotland because of the hostility and rejection associate with be gay after be treat so terribly by the state that he be work so hard to protect it take robert long time to be able to live happy healthy and fulfilled life for so many gay people over many generation move away from the home and family be way of find acceptance or at least anonymity and an escape from judgment and shame for robert like for so many other myself include weston super mare be place of sanctuary and healing our town look after people and be very proud of that over the past decade the raf and our other armed force have become international beacon of inclusion demonstrate that who we be be no barrier to serve our country today announcement be profound statement of who we be as country and importantly it remind we that we be strong and well defend because of that openness and candour there be some thing however that only government can and should do the independent review by lord etherton be powerful move towards justice and so many people be grateful to he for his diligence and compassion today announcement follow the government commitment to the victim of the contaminated blood and post office scandal those be profound act by the state to apologise to and rebuild trust with those who have wait far too long for fair treatment be grateful to the defence secretary the minister for veterans and people fight with pride and the previous government for their work to right this wrong hope that the thousand of affected veteran include my constituent robert in weston will receive meaningful justice like the front benchers want to start with an apology be sorry that anyone have to go through this as have be say the compensation do not make up for the treatment that victim receive or fix the situation it still happen and have be pleased to hear from everyone who have speak so far the recognition that it happen but should never have happen will talk little about some of the speech that have be make but first have number of question for the minister about the compensation scheme listen carefully when the secretary of state talk about how the scheme will work understand from what he say although may be wrong so it would be helpful if the minister clarify that there will be two pot one pot will be for flat payment of to people who be dismiss or discharge the secretary of state use the word instruct to resign little clarity on what that mean would be helpful if people be sit down and tell you must resign do that count as an instruction or would it be an instruction only if they be give letter formally tell they to resign where be the bar by which the flat payment of be judge the secretary of state seem to suggest that the other payment be for two different group it be for those who have suffer hardship in addition to the discharge imprisonment or additional discrimination for example but be not sure whether it be also open to those who be not discharge but do suffer discrimination as result of their sexuality do it fulfil those two purpose of be both top up payment and payment of recompense for those who experience more minor suffering than discharge some clarity would be helpful the scheme two year time period have be mention although appreciate that people need to know the closing date it would be helpful if the government commit to undertake some sort of review at say the one year point to ensure that the scheme be operate as intend that as many people as possible have apply and that the process be go smoothly this would allow the government to say we think two year be adequate because we reckon that of people have apply in the first year or we do think two year be appropriate and we therefore think the scheme should be extend to ensure that everyone who be entitle to this compensation can get it will people who be currently overseas be able to apply the hon member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven chris ward talk about people lose their sense of self and the hon member for weston super mare dan aldridge say that some people have to flee because they want to leave their trauma behind and may now be overseas as direct or indirect result of their treatment will they still be able to apply to the compensation scheme and to receive compensation regardless of where they currently live can the minister assure we that the charitable support will have geographic spread for instance if there be charity that work only in england will other charity be fund to provide support to veteran in other part of these island the citizen advice bureau in aberdeen have something like week wait for people to get any advice although it be national charity it have different waiting time in different place will the minister look into whether the charitable support have the geographic spread to ensure that everyone can get the help and support they need we have hear about people sense of self and about what they lose as result of either be discharge or have their life make so difficult that they could no long remain in the armed force the immensely powerful speech of the hon member for ayr carrick and cumnock elaine stewart set out the trauma her constituent go through and it echo the evidence give to the review it be very difficult for we sit here to listen to such account never mind for all those people who have to go through those horrific experience people lose not only their career or their standing in the community they lose part of themselves when they be tell you can not be both soldier and gay these people have dream forever of join the armed force and they serve with incredible bravery and honour only to be tell we do want you do the hon lady agree that it be not just the loss of job or pension but the loss of share value these people feel reject as they could no long do thing that other veteran be able to do together the hon lady talk about people who flee the country but karen in my mid dorset and north poole constituency be betray by another lgbt service member who be seek to protect themselves some personnel avoid their own discharge by betray someone else do the hon lady have any thought on that it be not my place to comment on individual who perpetrate such abuse nor to judge whether these be systemic issue or whether personal gain be receive however understand that people want redress the minister have recognise that above and beyond the pot of money specifically for those who be discharge there be another pot for those who face additional hardship one of my constituent have be in touch to say that he have intend to be in the armed force for life that be his plan and he have never want to do anything else his aim be to be member of the armed force when he be eject his hope dream and sense of self be all go from he and recover from that trauma be incredibly difficult appreciate the work that the minister and the secretary of state have do as well as the work do by the previous government in order to ensure the compensation scheme have come forward and appreciate that the amount of money in the pot have be increase have already ask some specific question but on the family of veteran it be incredibly important that there be follow through for example previously the medal send to some lgbt veteran be post in the normal post and fall through the letterbox on to the carpet along with bill from bt and energy supplier do not think that be appropriate or provide the same recognition that other people receive when they get their medal more can be do to ensure that be part of the family of veteran be not just warm word but reality people should be provide with welcome as well as be tell that they will provide with welcome to that family thank the minister and everyone who have speak today thank all the organisation and individual who have be fight for this outcome also thank those who have not be brave enough to tell their story and who be go through such difficult time that they be not able to do so those who be in the gallery today have be able to give voice on behalf of themselves but also on behalf of their friend and colleague who be not able to tell their story to we today or to the review thank those who have tell their story for be the voice for the community hope the minister be able to answer some of my question in order to ensure the compensation scheme work as the government intend and give an amount of recompense for the extreme trauma and suffering that people have be through be grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate welcome the secretary of state announcement that in response to the etherton review into the treatment of lgbt veteran additional amount of compensation will be offer to all victim and second tier payment will be offer to those most severely affected that be most welcome but it be so very late and it will never be enough to compensate our lgbt veteran for the treatment they suffer while try to serve our armed force and the abandonment they feel once they have leave as craig jones write in his book serve with pride which share some of the tragic story of lgbt life blight by this shameful period of military history with quiet dignity most have endure these be veteran deserve of our compassion for the adversity they have face and the courage they have show all while wait to be hear and acknowledge after all they have be through it be quite remarkable that for most their loyalty to the armed force have endure and still today many simply seek acceptance and recognition amongst their comrade today would like to tell the story of brave and commit solider that have the honour to meet my constituent veteran from year ago carry the heavy burden of shame of be dismiss from the service for be who they be rather than be thank for all that they do gunner ashton join the royal artillery in become the good small arm shoot and serve in germany defend we from the cold war threat he achieve top technical rating as surveyor be tip for promotion and spend four month in northern ireland at the border and by the falls road in belfast where he be shoot at bomb and see his comrade fall such bravery and courage such distinguished service and commitment such capability and achievement may place on record the pride and recognition that gunner ashton so richly deserve gunner ashton however serve three year before be medically discharge ex gunner ashton disappear back up north into obscurity never know he be victim of the gay ban not know he be veteran and certainly never have be thank for his service what sad end to promising career and sad indictment of the armed force disgraceful treatment of our lgbt officer at that time be glad to say that that be not the end of the story gunner ashton be courageous enough to seek help to become claire ashton the same kind compassionate and capable person that she have always be when meet she in our constituency be immediately impressed with her dignified approach her thorough and detailed account her excellent service record and her steely determination to seek recognition for the thousand of her comrade who have suffer this injustice and who deserve our recognition finally after year ex gunner ashton hear the prime minister apologise to our lgbt officer last year and launch the reparation and compensation scheme finally claire receive her veteran identity card and small veteran badge finally ex gunner ashton be recognise as veteran and for her remarkable contribution to the artillery claire join the ex service organisation that support lgbt personnel fight with pride and be give the honour of carry its standard at last year royal british legion festival of remembrance at the royal albert hall in front of the king and queen among veteran from the organisation stand shoulder to shoulder with thousand of our other veteran claire fine hour however be when wear her small veteran badge at the cenotaph passer by notice the badge and say simply thank you for your service that be the first person to do so it have take year would like to be the second person to thank she for her service and to ask that it be record in the houses of parliament claire ashton be here today have travel on the train at am from shrewsbury she be in the gallery watch the debate and hope that she feel the respect and admiration of this house for her contribution to our armed force hon member hear hear also hope she feel our earnest endeavour to put right this terrible wrong ask claire ashton if she have message for the minister and for this house she ask that we understand that in order to recruit and retain good recruit for our armed force we need to treat our veteran with the dignity and respect that they deserve serve personnel will ask what future do have in our force and new recruit will hesitate if they do not feel welcome we have an opportunity to learn the lesson from the past and ensure that strong recruit and excellent officer be support and nurture to reach their full potential and thrive in our armed force it be matter of fundamental welfare for serve personnel and veteran to feel safe and value indeed as claire ashton who will have the last word remind we that be all we want to feel value we have hear some very powerful story today it be not every day that my constituency surgery lead to well up be normally as hard as nail but recently have the pleasure of meet craig jones mbe one of the founder of fight with pride he talk so powerfully about his own and other veteran story of pain and injustice but he also speak of honour and pride it be deeply move to speak with he during our meeting the word honour come up time after time as craig describe his colleague in the armed force who suffer so much under the ban which we must reflect today be lift only in in the period before that thousand and thousand of service personnel be remove or force from service and many as we have hear be physically or sexually abuse craig tell that many of his colleague feel wash in shame because of what happen to they in those day simply admit to be gay be dangerous and have far reach consequence which we must compensate for today although homosexuality be decriminalise for civilian in it remain criminal offence in the armed force these people face imprisonment we must compensate fully for that craig describe move to brighton say that our city be the only place in which he and his partner feel safe on the day that the ban be lift he come out as gay and after few more year he leave the force he help find fight with pride and take part in that excellent campaign that lead to the etherton review and the action that we be pleased to welcome today but do not think that this be finish as other member have say the financial scheme be crucial it must provide full compensation it appear that lord etherton be unable to go high than the recommendation in the review of cap of million and be unable in his term of reference to recommend financial scheme that be unconstrained this million be rise but as other have say it be not high enough fight with pride have say that million would be more realistic estimate if it be to provide real justice to the people who might come forward in the interest of real justice do not believe that we can cap this number at all as the royal british legion have say in response to the early propose cap the cap provide an incentive for the ministry of defence to limit the number of people apply for compensation in opposition to the aim of achieve fair recompense moreover fight with pride today ask whether the flat rate of would really be able to compensate for the pension that would have be earn by all those people who be discharge early as craig point out to this have be discreet community we still do not know how many people could come forward have be harm by these unjust policy in way not envisage by the strict type of payment describe in today statement for the wide impact payment we be talk about harassment invasive investigation and imprisonment would welcome some clarity from the minister today as to whether this could go far people may have resign because they feel that they could not come out because they be not able to live in the way that they would choose to live they have still suffer harm they have be unable to fulfil their full potential which be genuine harm we have speak about shame and honour in the story that we have tell today there could be people who want their colleague to preserve their honour to help they not feel ashamed and who want to be discharge for state other reason so that nothing in the write record would confirm that they have suffer from the harm for which the flat rate payment be envisage but who have none the less suffer exactly the same harm would welcome some clarification on whether you might go wider and be willing to be challenge please say he sorry would the minister be willing to be challenge on those term in the future this compensation must bring the full comfort and security in old age that be enshrine in the armed force covenant it must bring true justice for the community that be sham so shamefully these payment must be look at again start by thank the secretary of state and my hon and gallant friend the minister for veterans and people for their intense understanding of this issue and of the whole veteran community this debate come at critical juncture in the story of these people these people of service who have be let down by our nation that be great source of national shame as other member have say although progress have be make we must ensure that these veteran some of whom have suffer immensely at the hand of the state be compensate adequately be pleased to hear the secretary of state announcement today especially around the financial arrangement it be delivery as promise and it be victory which have be long time come for these people as gay man in this place be all too aware that we stand on the shoulder of campaigner activist and giant of the lgbt right movement who have come before we for over three decade individual who serve or want to serve this country be sham or risk be sham expel imprison and put on register of sex offender in some case their life be destroy for the sake of their sexuality be lgbt be not weakness it be strength we train fight and serve as hard as anyone else like carbon keep under the earth crust for long time diamond emerge in our heart because of those experience these be the people who have build our force over the year we owe they great debt be glad that this discrimination which be once accept indeed institutionalised be over our force be well for it and our country be strong for it but for so long the value that we hold dear of respect duty service and honour be not uphold for these people who be let down such as my constituent steven without whom have tell this story before would not be raise this issue this be man who lobby from day one of my selection as the labour candidate and rightly continue to lobby to this day he be expel on suspicion of his sexuality his life be take from pride in what he be do to ruin in my recent adjournment debate we hear truly heartbreaking and harrowing story of service and betrayal of that service by those in power at the time as say in that debate pay tribute to fight with pride which have be at the forefront of this campaign alongside other colleague in the chamber individual such as craig jones my friend carl austin behan and the noble lords in the gallery lord etherton and lord cashman who have be part of this over long period have do so much to raise awareness of the unique challenge face by lgbt veteran and veteran more broadly as the minister know financial redress be key to justice for these veteran but the capped million allocate be plainly inadequate give the level of trauma and destruction that these people experience be it mental health crisis substance abuse homelessness destitution disownment by family be label sex offender be victim of suicide and more the scary thing be that this be not ancient history people have come to with story from the late when be kid it be not that long ago be glad to hear today announcement because frankly true justice have always require more substantial financial commitment that acknowledge the suffering and deliver fair and meaningful compensation while welcome the government action particularly around the scheme itself and the two pronged approach have some question on the cap especially for the second element of the scheme understand the flat rate approach for the first tranche but on the second tranche people who have experience complete horror of which we will probably hear more in the debate wonder whether cap of although that be substantial amount of money be enough redress the secretary of state mention that committee will assess case by case the experience of such veteran wonder whether the experience of that committee might leave it well place to decide the level of redress perhaps within an overall cap understand that particularly in the view of the treasury this be not always possible but it be good to have the maximum amount of flexibility in deal with specific case some of which be completely harrowing lord etherton review offer crucial road map and the noble lord have do veteran and indeed our country great service in bring we to this point complete the recommendation in full will ensure that veteran regardless of their orientation be treat with respect and fairness and from the government perspective it will honour the contract that be start with these man and woman so long ago contract that be break on the government side lastly welcome the restoration of rank and the amendment of dismissal reasoning and thank the minister for listen all the way through this process my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven chris ward have long be champion of this issue think he mention it to on the first day we be here know it have be long listen exercise for the minister there be still little far to go to ensure that there be maximum flexibility for our veteran but know he be do his good to champion the issue and right this wrong today can be consider great victory for these fighter thank the minister and the secretary of state for take the time and thank you madam deputy speaker for allow to contribute as retired raf police officer be particularly move by story where my own branch seem to have act so zealously perhaps it be appropriate that apologise on behalf of the raf police my hon friend the member for epsom and ewell helen maguire make the same request on behalf of the royal military police be glad that the debate be be hold at length in the house after it be deprioritise by the previous government perhaps it would have require olympic standard political gymnastic to show empathy with the victim of the lgbt ban apologise to those victim as do prime minister rishi sunak while manufacture order make the point early that we do not in this house refer to serve member of the house by name he remain the right hon member for richmond and northallerton thank you for correct madam deputy speaker the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak do so while the mother of brianna ghey be on the estate appreciate that be bit of change in tone from the rest of the debate but it be important that we recognise that the rhetoric we use in this house have cultural impact across the rest of society the government should be proud that they bring the debate before the house they have my gratitude and know there be people present who be directly affect by the ban include lesley davison who travel from south devon to be in the public gallery our lgbt veteran should have be able to serve their honourable career fully and retire simply as veteran but they be unfairly discard by the ministry of defence in line with the law of the very country they serve the ministry of defence describe this as moral stain on the armed force but it be also stain on the history of our country one haunt testimony come from constituent of north shropshire it be an account of how hundred of gallant proud and selfless service personnel be hunt by the military police arrest interrogate and often imprison for even an assumption of their sexuality take moment if you would not mind madam deputy speaker to imagine the line of questioning of an interrogation into one sexuality to anyone who be affect by the ban in any way believe you and be sorry by the time join the royal air force in the ban have be lift but the legacy of the ban and of the political culture at the time be toxic mentality that remain in plain sight for several year recall my initial trade training at raf cosford one particularly notorious training team threaten to call ahead to my future unit and have my head cave in once arrive for merely dare to voice support for the lgbt community be be sure that such intolerance continue to persist in small pocket of narrow mindedness that exist beneath the surface today but be proud that the raf leave in be indeed greatly transform and more inclusive organisation be now simply veteran during the general election campaign in june join some local veteran for communal breakfast in tewkesbury they be decent honest and selfless and they meet regularly and welcome as their own but before be introduce to the group at large one person pull aside and whisper do worry about the he she we just ignore it it turn out that it be transgender royal navy veteran gina shelton who have serve in the closet as man despite internally identify as woman to avoid persecution by her own friend and colleague spend few minute speak with she she be seat clearly separately from the rest of the main group and could not help but feel move by her courage and dignity as she speak matter of factly about her circumstance but with an affection and understanding for those fellow veteran who even now disown she she take responsibility for the way she be now ostracise which admire but reject otherwise enjoy the company of my fellow veteran should reiterate that these be decent honest people but meet gina remind that change mind be the great challenge before we and that challenge will endure long after legislation the liberal democrats have always stand with the community and be proud to have bring the equal marriage act into law while in government be proud that those treat unjustly by the lgbt ban have now be able to speak their truth it be difficult to put monetary figure on such an injustice but have consider the secretary of state announcement this afternoon we still call on the government to stand with the royal british legion and fight with pride and uplift the fund to million finally let these veteran legacy not be one of tragedy let member of this house learn the lesson that the previous government never do that the language we use in this place have real world consequence this be an important day for whole generation of ex service personnel in my constituency and across the uk who lose everything they know because of policy that be discriminatory and wrong pay tribute to the charity fight with pride and the coalition that have lead this campaign with the dignity of ex service personnel in the very good of that tradition we speak lot in this house about the tremendous debt and respect we owe to our armed force that be something we in aldershot and farnborough feel very deeply as people from our community have serve in every major conflict that our country have face over the past year yet the story we be hear today remind we that that respect be about not just word but deed thank lord etherton for his work and the government for listen respond and take action will use my time in today debate to draw the house attention to the sister ban of this policy for which the government be rightly compensate people the ban on people live with hiv join or serve in our military that ban be not repeal in it be repeal in and even now there be loophole that be still be exploit so regressive be the rule that people be ban from join the armed force even if they be hiv negative but be take the hiv prevention drug prep regrettably but not surprisingly opportunity to revise these rule be miss in in and yet again in even as the british government accept the can pass it on science about people live with hiv in relation to treatment in the year that follow no change be forthcoming those who be already serve personnel be label as medically not deployable it take the terrence higgins trust the national aids trust and remarkable hampshire resident lieutenant commander oliver brown mbe to right this wrong oli be cycle through london when brick hit his bike and he hit wall he be take to london hospital and as be finally become custom due to the last government and the million announce by the prime minister last week he be routinely test for hiv he discover that he be positive as his broken arm be be fix oli have to come to term with stigmatise diagnosis and worry not about whether he would live or have his family support but about whether he have job or place to live when he tell his employer the royal navy he be label and hold back thankfully he find similar gut and spirit to those of craig and fight with pride and become relentless campaigner on this issue in june the rule be finally sweep away not just for the lgbt community but for anyone live with hiv day later the civil aviation authority do the same and remove all barrier to pilot live with hiv on medication that be why everyone involve be so surprised that the military aviation authority give itself an extra two month to remove the ban and the obligation impose then have still not be fully fulfil people live with hiv be still not able to join the armed force as air crew or controller it would be great thing if off the back of this debate my hon friend the minister commit to investigate this issue and agree to meet oliver brown the terrence higgins trust and the national aids trust to find path forward on this issue we need to turn our military culture from just an absence of ban to one that promote hiv and sexual health testing with people be encourage to take charge of their sexual health the military need to be place where hiv stigma have no home our amazing hiv charity be on hand to help and the uk could be the first fast track military in commit to the goal of zero hiv transmission zero preventable death and zero hiv stigma to meet that global goal we need our armed force to do their bit if we achieve it it will be the first time we have stop the onward transmission of any virus without vaccine or cure we can not fail today be great day but the fight for equality be journey not destination draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests be very pleased to be able to speak in this debate as one of the newly elect co chair of labour and it be great honour to follow number of hon member who have give very powerful testimony from veteran it be very difficult to follow that and to do justice to this issue there be much interest in this debate and in the review of lgbt veteran as he mention my hon friend the member for burnley oliver ryan recently hold an adjournment debate on this topic he raise the issue that the ban have cause those who be dismiss and we have hear about many of those issue in the word of the veteran themselves people be dismiss under the ban and there be break family relationship poor mental health issue and marginalisation drive by the shame of be throw out of the military in his debate my hon friend rightly highlight that this have an impact not only on lgbt people but on those merely suspect of not be heterosexual it also have an impact on all those serve give the climate of fear and discrimination that it drive within the military he say in that debate that as young gay man it seem an alien world but of course this be discrimination not from century ago but from our lifetime and within live memory look at the history of this campaign which be the focus of much energy in the when be in the early day of my political campaigning it be worth note that there be an attempt year ago to change the law so that lesbian and gay man could serve in the military in the debate at that time the then mp for liverpool garston eddie loyden intervene on the minister who be defend the status quo as eddie explain he be one of the few remain member in the house at that time who have serve through the whole of the second world war the question he put to the minister which remember watch at the time be worth repeat speak of world war two he say be in no few than seven troop ship carry man and woman to the four corner of the globe to fight on behalf of the nation there be no question about homosexuality then if there be war tomorrow there would be no discrimination against homosexual or lesbian they would be drag in just as they be in report may vol of course there be plenty of discrimination and at the time of that debate but eddie be make the point that this policy be base not just on discrimination but on hypocrisy it be hypocrisy in that distinguished service be duly undertake and be often honour and recognise with medal only to be disregard and throw aside when the question of someone sexuality be raise far too many people suffer from that policy and the opportunity to end it early be lose as the government of the day assert that it would undermine military effectiveness if lgbt people be allow to serve my west ham predecessor in that debate tony banks be hear to shout rubbish at that assertion he be of course right someone be good soldier base on their skill bravery and good service be not dependent on someone sexuality history have since prove that it be rubbish as over the last year since the change in the law the military have continue to operate with distinction and lgbt people have play their part with honour within it that attempt to alter the law fail and it take until for the change to take place which lead to continue discrimination and suffering for serve personnel as we have hear those target lose not only their job but their reputation and rank and until the quarter of century after the decriminalisation of homosexuality in civilian life they face criminal conviction and jail time it be perhaps worth note how much have change since that debate of then we have only one openly gay mp chris smith and the idea that parliament would now have so many lgbt mps would have seem impossible to believe most of the freedom and privilege that the lgbt community now enjoy be yet to come indeed many of they be beyond the possibility of even campaign for this house have change the law have change and society have change too it have change for the well but the impact of the policy and the ban have long tail and veteran be still deal with it today that be why lord etherton report be so important this be live issue that we must resolve and welcome the progress we have make as society and the progress on deliver the recommendation very much welcome the announcement by the secretary of state about the financial redress be make available to veteran when speak recently to veteran they raise the issue of financial redress as the impact of dismissal from the military have have big impact on many some of whom be now of an age when the issue of support be press it will come as welcome news that we be make further progress on that and that application will open immediately we must ensure that all those eligible can easily apply it be also welcome that veteran will see the restoration of their rank and their service record amend very much welcome the fact that veteran be also be consider it be important to ensure that we deliver on all recommendation in the report so that all those who have serve and face discrimination can now wear their medal and remember their service with honour and pride and so that we can wipe away the hypocrisy that try to tarnish their service to their country it be important that we support veteran in that but also that we work to create culture of dignity and respect for those veteran to value they as society and to respect their service to their country and expunge the legacy of discrimination as so many member have already do we should pay tribute the campaigner who have fight hard for this campaign many of whom be in the public gallery that include those who stand up and lead the legal campaign of the and in more recent time the campaigner from fight with pride we be here because of they and this debate be build on their hard work we have an opportunity finally to draw the legacy of that shameful policy to close and place it fully into the dustbin of history it be an opportunity we have to take be grateful that the government be rise to that challenge and we must ensure that we rise fully to the need of that community today be moment to acknowledge the historical injustice endure by lgbt veteran and to reaffirm our collective responsibility as house to right the wrong of the past will share story of one of my constituent professor andrew hartle man whose life epitomise the resilience and achievement of lgbt veteran against the odd andrew join the royal air force in the full of ambition and desire to serve his country his early year in uniform be mark by excellence he rise swiftly through the rank as medical officer participate in search and rescue mission and serve in the first gulf war but while andrew be fulfil his duty he be live double life weigh down by constant fear of be discover at time when be openly gay in the armed force be not just taboo but illegal andrew face an impossible conflict to live authentically or to preserve the career he love in andrew be out in tabloid newspaper with the horrifying headline raf doc gay fling with an aids victim andrew be suspend subject to demean accusation and eventually force to resign for seven agonising month he be leave in limbo isolate from colleague forbid to access his nhs place of work and ostracise by an institution he have dedicate his life to serve andrew continue to face prejudice throughout his career nhs administrator demand he take an hiv test against his will that be just one of many humiliating incident that he experience after leave the military despite that discrimination and the obstacle he face andrew become the first openly gay consultant anaesthetist work at st mary hospital world class hospital serve many of my constituent in kensington and bayswater he rebuild his life and career become trailblazer in his field and have be powerful advocate for justice however for andrew and for so many other the scar inflict by the gay ban remain as andrew reflect in his own word come out as do be not my plan my mental health deteriorate and bury the impact of my outing and dismissal andrew be one of the fortunate one however he be here with we in the gallery today and he speak so powerfully on the radio this morning many other be not as lucky so welcome the government announcement today that they will move from apology to action the apology give last year by the former prime minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak be long overdue and be right he be right to describe the ban on lgbt people serve in the military as an appalling failure of the british report july vol he be right to highlight the abuse harassment and discrimination that many suffer but word alone be not enough this government have be clear that they will tackle historic injustice head on from horizon to grenfell and from infected blood to the horrific legacy of the ban on and mistreatment of lgbt veteran with today announcement we take meaningful step forward to support the veteran who suffer at the hand of the british state welcome the scheme focus on simplicity and speed of payment which be vital for veteran who have wait decade for justice also welcome the secretary of state clarification that those reparation will be ringfence ensure that veteran will not lose access to tax or benefit as result this moment would not have be possible without the tireless advocacy of organisation such as fight with pride so thank they for their dedication in support lgbt veteran and for their crucial role in secure today announcement also thank lord etherton for his review andrew story remind we of the immense personal cost of injustice his courage perseverance and achievement should inspire we all andrew have wait year but some have wait as long as tragically many veteran have die without ever see justice as we approach january the anniversary of the lifting of the ban we must also focus now on the task ahead of we to locate and support all eligible veteran to come forward and to ensure no one be leave behind hope that the minister for veterans and people can provide further detail on that strategy in his closing remark we must honour those who serve in silence who live in fear and who be ostracise simply for be themselves and love who they love that be not merely an act of kindness but moral obligation and be proud that this government be resolute in their determination to deliver it draw the house attention to my declaration in the register of members financial interests be humble by the testimony that have be share by my friend on both side of the chamber but be particularly move by my hon friend the member for shrewsbury julia buckley the testimony that have be share show we how ashamed we should be that our country treat so many people so badly for so long make no mistake we have have lgbt people in our armed service for as long as we have have armed service and be proud to call many of they my close friend they have share their harrowing story with but what always shin through be their loyalty to their service and their country today debate make proud to be labour mp remember the labour government lift the ban on lgbt soldier in celebrate that with my friend labour argue for the etherton review and thank lord etherton for his work now as labour mp welcome the recommendation will fight for every lgbt veteran to get the compensation that they deserve the historical treatment of our veteran be moral stain on our nation it be wrong on every single level we will never know how many good man and woman be too afraid ever to apply to serve their country or too afraid ever to come out to this day so many lgbt soldier have their hope and aspiration cut short despite their commitment to serve our country they be leave feel ashamed demoralise and humiliate when they should have be proud like be to be member of the lgbt community we can not undo the damage of the past but we can ensure that those who be affect receive what they be owe pay tribute to all the veteran with we today and to fight with pride which have support lgbt veteran for year and push government to do well also pay tribute to kelly holmes whose recent personal account be difficult to hear but typical of so many woman have speak to encourage every lgbt veteran to apply to have their rank restore so that they can feel pride again in the service they give to our country it be time to renew the nation contract with all those who have serve and deliver lord etherton recommendation be just small part of that hope that today be another historic landmark in the fight for equality for lgbt people in this country will support any veteran to get the compensation they deserve to restore their dignity and pride for their service for our country welcome lord etherton review and thank all the organisation and campaign group that contribute to it include fight with pride as my hon friend the member for shrewsbury julia buckley rightly say this be welcome but it be so late also place on the record my thank to my constituent in suffolk coastal who raise the issue with directly and have work for year to support their former military colleague who have suffer at the hand of this abhorrent and humiliating practice in particular thank kalvyn friend who contribute to the review and have engage with directly on the issue he and his colleague terry skitmore and simon wallington be perceive as gay in the and and be treat appallingly as result it be important that we acknowledge that there be many former armed service personnel who do not live to see this justice come about either they die natural death after the ban be remove or devastatingly they take their own life many of those who be still live have attempt to die by suicide or have think to do so have hear appal story from campaign group and charity the etherton review have expose harrowing story of member of the armed force and how they be treat by the very institution they be prepared to give their life for also thank the royal british legion which among other charity and campaign group provide evidence to the review and have highlight story from former veteran man and woman who face at good humiliation and at bad degrading and appalling act of intimidation as well as needless discharge from the armed force in some case they face imprisonment and no access to their military pension as we have hear reiterate that the cultural and operational justification for the ban as describe and endorse by the ministry of defence at the time have rightly be criticise in lord etherton report as an incomprehensible policy of homophobic bigotry it be crucial that we learn from those past mistake and that the principle of equality and respect that underpin our society be take forward in attend welbeck military college after leave join the territorial army serve in the royal logistics corps this be just few short year after the ban be lift but the shadow of the policy be still evident serve personnel be terrify of be find out still live their life in the shadow at college have teacher and physical training instructor who have live with and live through the ban have be personally affect by the homophobic policy or have see at first hand how friend and serve colleague have be bully out of the army and live their life in the shadow unsurprisingly many have suffer from mental health problem bring on by live and work in an institution that have previously try to hunt they out for be gay or bisexual even though the ban be lift by the time leave welbeck college and the ta see how the culture linger for lgbt colleague we have hear today that although the ban be lift in the culture and the practice be still evident among serve personnel when be there colleague still feel that they have to hide their sexual orientation and that it be still something to be ashamed of they be not proud or open in the way that we be today and that we take for grant in society now the impact of this abhorrent practice can not be overstate the lifelong scar it have have on so many who give so much to our nation be stain on our military history and more widely on our society the review rightly recommend that compensation would be an appropriate mean of redress be delighted that we have increase the compensation from million to million if that have be leave unchanged it might have equal as little as per claimant urge the government to make sure that the payment be make quickly and without delay it be important that we do what we can to make sure that the compensation be release quickly to those who deserve it welcome this announcement and once again thank all those who contribute to the review and who take it forward the work be do to implement the recommendation will go some way to recognise the past failure of the ministry of defence it be privilege

announce reparation be another failure which be in danger of erode the public faith in politic to deliver for people see no point in in blame the previous government in fact commend the work of the previous government and of lord etherton and of our own government in bring forward this scheme so swiftly however just as we see with the hillsborough scandal the infected blood scandal and the post office horizon scandal we must move more quickly to compensate people concur with the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper and for aberdeen north kirsty blackman who emphasise that the scheme must be deliver swiftly and in measured way long delay simply prolong the agony of the many veteran who have wait decade for an apology and for the formal financial reparation announce today have constituent janice maciver who serve in the british army and be catch up in this dark period of our history in the some year ago from to ms maciver serve with the army intelligence corps in hong kong and england there be nothing wrong with her work or her service to the country but on june she be unceremoniously and dreadfully kick out of the british army and send back from hong kong simply because of who she be many veteran affect by this scandal have lose their home health and peace of mind because of the awful treatment mete out to they ms maciver be resilient individual as islander tend to be and she manage to get herself back on her foot she serve her country in another way as police officer with career of public service span two decade however as we have hear today some people

still hurt she do get letter of apology from the head of the army which she appreciate and new beret and the intelligence corps be to welcome she back to base in ceremony next month it be fantastic that janice sister be fly from australia to be with she and support she at that event the new level of compensation be very welcome but for janice and many other veteran it be not just about the money it be about have proper acknowledgment and acceptance that what be do to she the way she be treat by her country after serve her country be wrong this announcement hope will go some way to repair the damage do hope that with this that sad episode will be do and dust but it ought to be record and acknowledge in army record and museum it belong in the past what happen to janice and to thousand of other veteran be wrong which be so evident it be widely acknowledge and it be shame it have take so many year to put it right however be glad of today announcement and hope that lgbt service personnel and veteran can now say finally that they have serve with pride call the shadow secretary of state with the leave of the house be wind up this debate as well as open it as you can see madam deputy speaker there be only two of we and there be bill committee sit at the same time there be some thing we can not physically get around in that situation be very grateful to you madam deputy speaker for let wind up it enable to pay tribute to some incredible speech today all of they move in which member have share the many traumatic case of their constituent they underline exactly why the government have make this announcement today base on the review that we launch in government some specific theme be raise the hon member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven chris ward speak of time run out the hon member for ayr carrick and cumnock elaine stewart also speak about the issue of time and the urgency of get this resolve my constituency neighbour the hon member for suffolk coastal jenny riddell carpenter speak of how she want to see payment get out quickly and without delay be sure we all agree and echo that sentiment be sure the minister will provide clarity where he can in particular on the second payment the lgbt impact payment which will presumably have long process give the presence of the panel perhaps he could give some indication of the timing he expect in that regard the hon member for south east cornwall anna gelderd remind that we should thank our serve lgbt personnel and not just talk about veteran of course they serve in very different military and very different military culture we wish they well and thank they for their public service there be many move case mention what strike in particular be the reminder of the impact literally the impact on those people concerned the hon member for mid sussex alison bennett speak about the case of constituent who be imprison in the case mention by the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tom rutland they be put in psychiatric ward because of be lgbt my hon friend the member for dumfries and galloway john cooper speak about his constituent attempt suicide and be sexually assault the hon member for ayr carrick and cumnock say that we deny people their freedom while they be defend ours paraphrase but think that be an excellent statement there be other case which we might say have some kind of happy ending or at least they go on to do other thing which we should honour the hon member for shrewsbury julia buckley speak about the very moving case of someone who understand be in the gallery gunner ashton obviously have very difficult experience but then go on to carry the banner of the royal british legion at the royal albert hall remembrance evening be at the most recent one and it be an incredible occasion so pay tribute to she the hon member for kensington and bayswater joe powell speak about constituent who become very senior clinician we hear from the hon gentleman for the western isles if he do not mind call it that the hon member for na eileanan an iar torcuil crichton who speak about his constituent who obviously suffer great trauma but become police officer he call it the resilience of islander think we have see that resilience in other case speak of today the hon member for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor say that she believe there have be lgbt soldier ever since we have have an army again paraphrase but she be probably absolutely right although of course lord etherton have not quite go back that far in his review echo that theme the hon member for west ham and beckton james asser in very enjoyable speech make the point that so many would have serve in world war two we should remember that and pay tribute to they because that sacrifice give we our freedom which mean we be here today he also make very good point which think make in my opening speech when we talk about military skill and the bravery of people who serve in our armed force with distinction those feature be irrelevant to background and sexuality that be very good point indeed the hon member for tewkesbury cameron thomas who believe be former raf policeman make the point that the raf have change significantly it be important that he mention that point the hon member for aldershot alex baker along with the hon member for kensington and bayswater remind we of the importance of the hiv issue and the additional associate stigma in that regard she make the laudable point of call for zero hiv stigma in the armed force today wonder whether the minister would want to comment on that finally the hon member for burnley oliver ryan have an adjournment debate recently on this subject so he exemplify the great persistence we have see from number of colleague in this house on this subject few be not here at the moment which may be because of slightly premature end but hopefully they will see in hansard that have pay tribute to their speech there be lot of excellent contribution will conclude by say this as the secretary of state say in his opening speech in addition to implement the recommendation of lord etherton review we must ensure we thoroughly learn the lesson of this deeply sorry and regrettable episode in our defence history they be two separate thing and it be crucial we do both terrible thing be wholly unjustifiably inflict on brave and committed service personnel with lifelong repercussion for those affect as we have hear from case up and down the country it be incumbent on all of we to reflect on this have happen in our country all those who put themselves forward for service must be treat with the dignity and respect that they deserve we should all share in the mission to correct this historic wrong because we all know that every person affect will have share equally the same value of freedom patriotism and public service as anyone else in the armed force today we salute they and as far as we be able we take far significant step to restore full and formal recognition of the role of lgbt veteran serve our country what debate we have have today we have hear some exceptionally harrowing and indeed inconceivable story of event that have take place in our lifetime on that note and on behalf of the ministry of defence wish to apologise to all those affect by the ban the way in which the mod mistreat lgbt personnel between and be flame injustice that have burn for more than five decade it be an injustice that be acknowledge by lord etherton excellent report last year and as say during our debate six week ago it be an injustice that put the mod on the wrong side of history it be an injustice that the last government work to heal with the support of member in all part of the house and for that we thank they when the scheme open tomorrow at hour and we finally begin the important process of offer financial recognition of the pain cause we will turn page and start new chapter in defence history this government have take the decision to increase the amount that can be disburse by the scheme by more than the plan that we inherit not only will those dismiss or discharge from service receive payment those who be impact more broadly by the ban will do so too however it be important to acknowledge at the outset that no amount of money can undo the hurt and pain cause and no process can genuinely quantify the impact on earning this be financial acknowledgment of wrongdoing and regret by the state and while know that it will not fully satisfy all hope that it will help to bring affirmation and some closure to those affect the scheme will also address two more of lord etherton recommendation include rank restoration and rewrite those record leave just seven to be complete which remain major priority thank all member on both side of the house for their comment and the harrowing story that they relate and will now try to address some of their specific question let say first to my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven chris ward that we be work exceptionally hard with fight with pride and other charity to ensure that we advertise this scheme as broadly as possible across the community indeed this debate itself be one way to get that message out we have month of the recognition scheme primarily because of the prerogative power but also follow the recommendation of lord etherton report we have allocate to help charity to assist the veteran with their application because we acknowledge that some of the process may not be as simple as other we be also ask for reverse burden of proof on the access of the million financial total predict the number of case that will come forward will be exceptionally difficult experience will differ time serve will differ and therefore the amount of recognition will differ as well as we hear from the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper face the treasury be perhaps much safe than face the enemy nevertheless thank those in the treasury and the broad team in the ministry of defence for work so hard champion by the secretary of state for defence to deliver the extra million increase on what we have previously speed of delivery be essential and we have go for both speed and breadth the speed to deliver the scheme as fast as feasibly possible and the breadth to ensure that compensation be deliver to all those affect by the ban both dismiss and discharge those who may have be impact by the ban but not necessarily record this be mention by the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman will also be able to apply for these resource we appreciate the comment of the shadow secretary of state the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge as well as his work prior to our come into government hope that lgbt veteran now feel more than ever before part of the veteran family thank primarily to the restorative measure in lord etherton report which have go so far to deliver that we have now implement of those recommendation and think we will close they out by responsibility for some of they do not sit with the government but we be work hard with the office for veterans affairs and other government departments to close they out as quickly as possible will cover two of the point raise by the hon member for aberdeen north and my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven now but will address other later overseas applicant can apply the scheme be open to everyone we will have look at the geographical spread of charitable support although we do not have huge amount of control over it we will ensure that it be balanced and will work with the office for veterans affairs to deliver it my hon friend the member for aldershot alex baker mention the important subject of hiv can confirm that we be on the case although there be no blanket ban on hiv positive personnel fly in the armed force the government be absolutely committed to ensure that our policy that impact on people with hiv be regularly review and the minister for the armed forces in particular be closely consider hiv policy relate to aircrew and we will get back to my hon friend in due course my hon friend the member for burnley oliver ryan and the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire for aberdeen north and for brighton pavilion siân berry mention concern about the cap the financial recognition scheme be response to gross injustice we acknowledge that it be design to be tangible acknowledgment of wrongdoing and regret and be never intend to compensate for loss of earning but accept that there will always be people who feel for good reason that we have not go far enough north cornwall constituent of mine be attend the debate from the public gallery but have have to leave because of the outrage that he feel do the minister agree that great financial compensation should be give to veteran such as my constituent who suffer such enormous harm include gang rape and severe physical assault that result in lifetime disability thank the hon member for that question we have try to balance demand for individual circumstance to be fully recognise on case by case basis with the demand for speedy resolution we have arrive at amount that reflect the practice of relevant employment tribunal and payment make for harm and suffering in the service complaint process which also align with similarly sized payment award by the scheme in canada although government scheme of this type will always cause debate acknowledge that we have do our good to be fair and balanced use figure base on relevant precedent and process that will reflect individual circumstance within framework design to avoid delay and ensure fairness across that cohort it be probably worthwhile to dig into that in little more detail to provide the house with answer the lgbt dismiss or discharge payment for veteran who be dismiss or discharge base solely on their sexual orientation or gender identity under the ban will be flat rate of the lgbt impact payment be open to all those who experience any pain and suffering directly relate to the ban include bullying and harassment invasive investigation and of course imprisonment those who be dismiss and discharge can also apply for that payment the lgbt impact payment will be assess by an independent panel against three to to and to up to maximum of to ensure that award be proportionate to the level of impact we hear several question particularly from my hon friend the member for shrewsbury julia buckley about why the measure have take so long today have be more than year in the making totally agree that veteran have wait far too long for this recognition of historical injustice however since come into government we have move exceptionally fast this government have bias for action we come into government in july listen to fight with pride and the lgbt veteran inform and update the house and colleague last month and design broad and rapid payment scheme and at tomorrow that scheme will open and deliver we also have some question about the impact of loss of earning particularly to do with pension it be worth note that this be not compensation scheme and have not be design as such with such variety of experience and personal circumstance within the affected community and with limited evidence available it be difficult to estimate how long each veteran would have serve if not for the ban and what rank they might have reach finally on the question about lord etherton recommendation two be for the ministry of defence to implement and five be for the national health service to address my team be in touch with the department of health and social care as we move that forward as various member mention it be worth note the broad non financial restorative measure that be take place there be application already which be fantastic in practice this mean everything from apology letter send directly to individual from the chief of the army the royal navy and the air force through to medal and beret ensure that these veteran feel include as part of the veteran community when join the royal marines in this abhorrent ban on homosexuality in the armed force be still in place today quarter of century later we turn page on that shameful chapter in our national story the financial recognition scheme be an acknowledgment by the state that it be wrong while accept that many veteran will continue to feel that it do not go far enough the scheme be another vindication of the harm and pain they have suffer and vindication for all those who stand against the ban urge everyone affect by these past failing to access the financial recognition scheme and other restorative measure by visit the lgbt veteran support page on the website on this page they will find simple guide explain how to apply for financial recognition payment which include detail of the scheme eligibility and the support document require there be simple screenshot of what to expect when apply and the application form have be streamline to make the process straightforward and user friendly to ensure that veteran can apply with as much ease as possible thank lord etherton for his outstanding work on this report also thank the lgbt community and the charity that support it particularly fight with pride for their courage and continue effort to bring this to resolution they have engage comprehensively throughout the programme with both the mod team and have an old saying from combat courage be decision not reaction few have be so courageous as those watch this debate today to stand up to struggle to your foot when everyone be try to push you down and to shout when everyone be try to silence you that be an active decision and perhaps the most courageous decision of all they should stand proud from here on out the debate today and the speed at which we have work the fact that from tomorrow at the scheme will open be credit to all those who have work on the team it also reaffirm that this government be government of action indeed we have bias for action and the defence secretary and will continue to drive this forward until every recommendation of lord etherton review be implement to right the wrong of the past to the individual affect victoria craig danny claire andrew and janice to name but few we apologise we hope that this will go some way through the healing process in line with claire ashton and my hon friend the member for shrewsbury we want to ensure that every veteran who have help to keep britain secure receive the respect and support they deserve question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider lord etherton independent review into the treatment of lgbt veteran send provision autism and adhd motion make and question propose that this house do now jones be grateful for the opportunity to address this critical issue that affect so many family and carer not just in my constituency but across the country rise to speak up for all those who feel they be not be hear and to speak about the crisis in the provision of special educational need and disability support particularly for child and young people with autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder this crisis be fail child and young people their family and carer the professional who support they and society as whole before proceed thank all the courageous parent and carer who have take the time to tell their story some of they have come to westminster today to be with we in the gallery pay special tribute to the staff from school in my constituency include bassingbourn melbourn and hauxton primary school who have take the time to attend this critically important debate and be with we in the gallery be privileged to meet staff at bassingbourn primary school where witness at first hand the inspire work undertake by dedicated and caring professional who be create safe space such as the hub see for myself the calm and trust relationship build with student and hear about the difference that the hub make for student rather than spiral into disruptive behaviour or not even be able to make it through the door to registration some day student be now seek out the hub as space to ready themselves for registration or to take time out before go back to class the headteacher staff and the send co ordinator go above and beyond often make miracle happen on very limited budget however let share the word of one dedicated professional from my constituency so that the house can hear what the current crisis be lead to she say on daily basis be set up deliver and help other teaching assistants to deliver bespoke curriculum for child with send as they be mostly educate outside the class of their peer we do not have special unit for they we be just accommodate they as well we can in quieter area of the school include corridor because they be not able to work in the noise and business of primary classroom the need of these child vary though they all need ta to help they and other stay safe regulated and learn throughout the day at present we have two non verbal child with an autism diagnosis who year ago you would not have expect to see in mainstream school up until this week have believe that be do the right thing try to make sure they be happy and secure and genuinely learn and make progress with we that professional be now question the very fundamental of her profession as result of the heartbreaking experience of those child when they be face key transition start school primary to secondary get to to and afterwards one of the child she have be work with be exclude few day after start secondary school because their behaviour be not manageable in her word it break my heart to hear from her mum what she have go through in such short time in mainstream secondary and know at once that she must have be so frightened to have behave as she do the child be subsequently at home for most of the remain school year receive education from tutor pay for by the local authority after her parent fight hard and demand it and then be finally give place at their local special school in the summer what now understand be that the broken system mean that child have to fail in very distressing way before they be give the provision they need could not sit by and see another child have know for many year go down the same path with all the knowledge of how damaging the experience will be for they without say something about it the account the hon lady be give be incredibly powerful and be really grateful that she have choose to share it with the house as somebody who be teach math at secondary school until few month before the general election can state that the situation she describe while certainly not unusual be not universal to all school be pleased to report that despite the stress that be put on school by the previous government we teacher do all we could in secondary education setting to ensure there be an inclusive education for those with send do she agree that with the change of government we have see change in direction and intention and hopefully we will see the win for send student that they so desperately deserve absolutely be here to pay tribute as be everybody to what teacher be do both with regard to the failure of the previous government and with the current situation let we get to what be happen with the current government every child deserve access to education to get the good start in life and build strong foundation that can provide valuable skill that allow they to thrive that be not the case for all child across the country and particularly not for those with autism spectrum disorder and adhd every professional have speak to agree that early diagnosis and support be essential in respect of early diagnosis and onward support in my constituency of congleton we have two specific problem first although some child receive diagnosis under the right to choose pathway on the nhs other often from more deprived background face considerably long wait than they would under that pathway the impact of that on those child concern very much secondly cheshire east council sometimes go for period of time when it close the education health and care plan application pathway to new entrant because it be so overwhelmed by the number of application it already have both those be serious issue for child in my constituency and thank the hon member for south cambridgeshire for secure this debate and give the opportunity to air they do she agree that it be huge improvement to have government who be integrate send support and that there be so much more that we be all look to do will come on to what think be postcode lottery we see regional disparity in the care and provision give so thank the hon member for raise that point for many the wait to get assessment for education health and care plan can be month if not year lord darzi investigation of the nhs in england note waiting list for community service and mental health have surge the report also mention how demand for assessment for adhd and autism have grow exponentially in recent year with child disproportionately represent among they recent research find that child in england be struggle to get an education health and care plan that be family leave in uncertainty desperate for help and struggle without the support they need cambridgeshire currently have student with ehcp increase in the last five year and of those plan primarily address autism spectrum disorder indeed be tell by the chief executive of cambridgeshire county council that there have be an increase of in the number of child present with autism request for education health and care need assessment have rise fast than the national average why we think that be drive by great awareness of send and the statutory responsibility of local authority the impact of the covid pandemic and the overall increase in mental health issue for child even at very young age those number help to underline the scale of the issue but we should not get draw purely into statistic and figure because behind every number and every percentage there be child family or sibling be fail every single day come to the issue of disparity that the hon member for congleton mrs russell mention family who can afford to seek private neurodevelopmental assessment tend to receive help much fast than those who be reliant on public service for the rest it be postcode lottery nhs england datum reveal stark regional disparity in waiting time for diagnosis for example the north west region have the long average wait of three year and four month from referral to diagnosis we therefore have health inequality element to this too as certain group of child be less likely to have their need identify or meet punish just because of where they live for some child mainstream school be simply not suitable and parent and carer bear the brunt of that reality manage reduce timetable endure repeat exclusion and watch their child receive only few hour of education each day be grateful to the hon lady for bring this important debate to the house follow on from her comment about mainstream education one of my first job after leave university be as teaching assistant also spend year in special need school do she agree that the issue we be see be partly the result of the lack of recognition and appreciation over the last year for support staff in mainstream school and of the role that they play in ensure that every child have decent education could not concur more over the past decade or more we see chronic under investment from the conservative government despite the need have be recognise in statute and that have leave we in this pressure point situation we be now see the result of that have also be tell that this be time bomb because we will see the impact in the future in the quality of life in opportunity in the nhs and in social service in all service really if we do not deal with this situation have also be tell about the situation for sibling when child be not give the support that they need in school young carer sibling be often draw out of their class and ask to be with their sibling during their lunch break or lesson there be an impact on all those affect on that point about young carer do my hon friend agree that at the moment school struggle to recognise how many young carer be on their roll do she think that the department for education would be wise to look at well way of measure the number of young carer and give school the toolkit to identify they could not agree more with my hon friend the carers trust have provide we with these story and point out that we really need to collect this evidence it would be easy to point the finger at local council and say that this be their failure but as we have say they be stretch to their limit by chronic lack of funding we have hear that the cross party local authority campaign group have estimate that an additional billion of annual send revenue be require to meet the current need yet most of our county council face black hole in their budget one issue be the training and retention of educational psychologist because they and council worker be overwhelmed turnover rate be high and burnout be common which lead to an exacerbation of those waiting list thank the hon member for allow to intervene again appreciate it cheshire have some of the low per pupil funding in the country there be direct link between school that receive relatively low level of funding and council that have relatively high level of send diagnose because there be not the same support in mainstream classroom as when there be high staffing ratio which we find in area that have well funding we need to look at equalise that funding as well we can in the current environment to improve support at an early stage as the hon lady be mention agree with the hon member my constituency of south cambridgeshire also have among the low per pupil funding which exacerbate the fact that even though we have ehcp most of they be not fund to the amount that be require for each of those student that compound the situation that our amazing school be try to deal with let return to educational psychologist cambridgeshire county council have budget educational psychologist role but remain vacant due to national shortage and the fact that psychologist can get well pay in other job and other place we be see an inability to fill those role and to support psychologist the liberal democrats be call for national body for send to end the postcode lottery face by family of child with the high need that would include look at immediate government action to prioritise early diagnosis and support for child with send and to increase funding for diagnostic service one concern be that many child end up be out of education because they be not get the support that they need in school do she agree that it be an outrage that in that situation some parent face prosecution do she also agree that we need to provide support for child to receive an education whether in school or through alternative provision and that we should record that in well way at the moment we have authorise and unauthorised absence we do not record the fact that some child be miss school because their parent do not believe that they be receive the support that they need thank my hon friend for raise one of the complex issue around this provision while we support the current government additional allocation of funding to this critical area we really want they to look at the fact that it be not just about mainstream provision it be also about specialist provision as she say we must look at all type of provision because this be complex even if support be give in mainstream school it be often on very reduced timetable which mean that parent and carer be unable to work and be productive for society because they be either cover the space in that provision unauthorised or otherwise in other setting or cover for the time when the school can not provide timetable support return to what the liberal democrats think we should have national send body an urgent increase in diagnostic service action to address the chronic lack of educational psychologist target resource for local authority to improve their capacity support for our school and for more special school place and interim support measure for child await diagnosis so that they do not fall through the crack the lib dems have always say that we need mental health professional in every school it be great to hear the government talk about mental health professional in secondary school we have hear about the need in primary school so let we get in there early too capacity for early diagnosis and management mean as somebody say to in the word of desmond tutu that we can stop pull people out of the river and instead stop they fall in the river in the first place once again pay tribute to all the amazing parent and carer who have speak to and the amazing teacher headteacher and send co ordinator who be work in this area the hon member for south cambridgeshire pippa heylings end with the word of desmond tutu and could not agree more congratulate she on secure this debate on an incredibly important subject and congratulate hon member on their valuable contribution to it know that as former teacher she be really aware of the critical role that education play in break down barrier to opportunity and how vital it be that we get our education and health service right to support the most vulnerable in our society she describe incredibly eloquently and powerfully the difference that good inclusive education provision can make and the significant challenge in provide it she also mention the challenge that many child face at transition point which can undermine some of the incredible work that teacher be perform up and down the country as my hon friend the member for leeds south west and morley mr sewards rightly point out like other present the hon member for south cambridgeshire will have be inundate with letter and email from concerned family in her constituency be sure she have be help they to navigate the incredibly challenging special educational need and disability system so many of we be face with this issue which be why we need to reform the system it be priority for the government we want all child regardless of where they be in the country to receive the right support to succeed in their education and lead happy healthy and productive life in far too many case we have simply lose the confidence of family that child with special educational need and disability will be support because they be be fail by every measure despite high need funding for child and young people with very complex special educational need and disability rise to high and high level the system be simply not deliver the outcome that those child deserve so we desperately need to reform the system our message to family be that we be committed to improve the send system and regain their confidence completely agree with the minister comment part of ensure that we provide the correct support to child be ensure that the education health and care plan assessment process be effective be tell by charity worker in my constituency of dewsbury and batley that of appeal in kirklees against conclusion that send support be not need be successful do she agree that this be terrible waste of council resource and that ehcp assessment must be do properly and get right the first time so that child can be give support as soon as possible absolutely recognise the challenge the hon gentleman have outline but it very much speak to the point be make which be that we have publish independently commission insight that suggest that if the education system as whole be extensively improve and if we have much well early intervention which the hon member for south cambridgeshire rightly refer to and well resource within mainstream school that could lead to ten of thousand more child and young people have their need meet without an education health and care plan their need would be meet within mainstream system and with their peer without need specialist placement clearly we need specialist place for child with the most complex need but to ensure we have those place we need to improve inclusivity and expertise within mainstream school while ensure that those special school and place can cater to child with the most complex need come back to the hon lady point about transition point for young people and how important it be for the whole system to be reform it be not good enough to reform just part of it and for that great work to then be undo when child or young person move on to new educational setting that do not provide the right support and environment for they my point be that this situation be huge and complex there be not magic wand and there be no overnight quick fix but we be determined to change it and we can not do it alone we need to work in partnership to achieve this thank the minister for her response so much could be say about special educational need across the country and in my constituency of mid sussex the minister mention how we all as member of this place be undoubtedly try our good to help family navigate the special educational need system be sorry to say that when family come to and ask how can help you they say we do think you can help we we just want you to witness and listen to what we be say because the system be so broken meet the family of annabel in mid sussex she have be out of school for several year have be section and have have multiple suicide attempt because her autism be not be manage in the schooling system her family just want to bear witness to they and be so sorry that there be not more that we as parliamentarian can do the hon lady have bear witness today to that family and young person face that challenge it be vital that we work together with parent school council the health sector and expert staff who we know go above and beyond to support child within education setting to achieve the change that be clearly desperately need the hon member for south cambridgeshire specifically focus the debate on support for autistic child and young people and those with adhd she will know from the work she have undertake that we be see significant increase in the number of child and young people identify as autistic or with adhd and that be something we share in common with other country around the world we know family be face significant challenge and that support need to be in place as she outline to ensure that those child can thrive in school we absolutely recognise the long waiting time across the nhs for autism and adhd assessment and we be work to address they as the hon lady identify we need to ensure that mainstream school and college can identify those need and put support in place early because the early child get the support and right environment in which to learn the more chance that they will thrive and that some of the challenge they face will be mitigate ensure that we have knowledgeable professional in our school and college be key part of this all teacher be teacher of pupil with special educational need and disability but we need to make sure those teacher have the skill and support to help all pupil succeed as such we be implement range of teacher training reform that begin with initial teacher training and continue through early career teaching to middle and senior leadership we have universal send service contract which provide send specific course and professional development for school and college staff through that contract the autism education trust offer range of training and support for staff on how to support autistic child and young people the contract begin in may and over professional have receive training from the autism education trust and training partner on september this government introduce new mandatory leadership level national professional qualification for senco we be make the change but it will take time for they to work through our partnership for inclusion of neurodiversity in school programme be also run in around of school which be approximately mainstream primary school setting it be deploy specialist from both the health and education workforce and build well teaching and staff capacity to identify the need of neurodivergent child it provide opportunity to enhance support and improve outcome for all child take whole school approach it be cross government programme back by million of investment and it be collaboration between the department of health and social care the department for education and nhs england additionally we have just establish neurodivergence task and finish group bring together group of expert from various background to help we understand how to improve inclusivity in mainstream school in way that work for neurodivergent child and young people we know that listen to child and young people and their family and understand their experience be really important part of this work that group meet for the first time this week and look forward to see their recommendation on the good way that we can support these child need this be happen alongside our expert advisory group on inclusion and the work be do by dame christine lenehan our new strategic adviser on send we be look at all of these issue strategically across government as we urgently need to turn this situation around could go into the detail of high need funding but be very conscious of time appreciate the concern that have be raise about the national funding formula we prioritise speed over change this year we need to get the formula process and out to school and educational institution but we will obviously keep it under review to make sure the money be be spend in the most effective way to deliver the good outcome for child we have also allocate million for high need capital funding to support mainstream school to adapt if need to create more inclusive mainstream setting thank the hon member for south cambridgeshire again for bring this matter forward ensure that effective support be in place for young people be absolutely priority of this government we know the hardship that far too many family have face and my final word of thank go to all those work in the interest of our child in our health education and care system we will deliver the good for our child and young people and be confident that together we can achieve that question put and agree to house adjourn
