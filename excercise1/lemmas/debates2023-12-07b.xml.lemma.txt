friendly and do everything they can to reduce air pollution at their school so that all pupil be safe and healthy labour proposal for clean air act would establish legal right for everyone to breathe clean air abide by world health organisation clean air guideline why will the government not commit to that it seem to that no action be be take at the moment by the labour mayor of manchester the government take air pollution incredibly seriously which be why we have award million to english local authority since to support the delivery of more than local project specifically to tackle air pollution we have also put an additional million grant to local authority in alone into tackle the negative implication of air quality specifically research show that can be to high in electric version of heavy application such as bus and truck than in their internal combustion engine equivalent do my hon friend agree that in order to get clean air and cut down we need an eclectic future that embrace all technology and our great innovator not just battery electric as have say will always welcome innovation when it come to improve air quality not only in transport but in the implication of industry and commercial operator it be clear that through the environment act the government introduce the legally bind target to reduce we have set goal to reduce exposure to by by call the shadow minister from bournemouth to bolton hull to newcastle under lyme people be cry out for action to clean our air but the air quality target the minister just mention which be eventually set under the much delay environment act be at twice the world health organisation limit and do not have to be meet until so do he accept the judgment of his government own office for environmental protection that on clean air tory ministers be unambitious and lack the urgency we need this government through our landmark environment act have set key target that we will be deliver on many opposition members do not support all of its measure as for support local authority as have say we be invest million to support they in deliver more than project to specifically tackle air pollution and air quality issue food security what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on help to ensure food security strengthen food security by support world class farmer and food producer be top priority for this government we produce of the food we consume and food be one of the uk critical national infrastructure sector which we regularly discuss with cabinet colleague recently visit tom farmer from my constituency at the family farm in pepperstock where we speak about the importance of uk food sustainability grow harvesting and eat domestic produce that be at risk without well function seasonal worker scheme the national farmers union recommend improve the current scheme by secure it for five year with annual review and by increase the visa period to nine month to cover long harvest do the secretary of state agree that those potential reform could support great food security in the uk and mean less reliance on food import agree with the hon lady on the importance of food productivity and the sustainability of our farming sector which be why we hold the uk farm to fork summit in may chair by the prime minister where we discuss food security with representative it be also why just in this past week we announce million to support our farming and rural sector in get innovation to farm and to help with cost such as for solar as part of that investment welcome my right hon friend to his new role and in particular the experience of negotiate with the european union that he bring to it which will become more and more important in the month ahead welcome his remark about support the farming industry but ask he not to forget the seafood industry and its importance in provide food security be sure he will not as he also know he have an open invite as the new environment secretary to visit my constituency which be major fishing constituency in the uk while he be there if not before through virtual meeting will he meet and member of the seafood industry to discuss the way forward because as much as we welcome the measure announce early this week to tackle abuse of legal migration there be concern as we transition away from freedom of movement obviously be happy to give commitment to meet my hon friend to discuss those important issue he will be interested to know that just this week have series of meeting with fishing leader to discuss some of the issue include not only the negotiation but the interaction with other area of government not least in respect of the offshore wind sector and the pressure on space we also discuss the work go on in our marine protection zone and how that interact with the fishing industry which be absolutely committed to support call the shadow minister too welcome the new minister the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs the hon member for keighley robbie moore and the new secretary of state believe he be the fifth during my time in the shadow environment team the fish our fisher catch be vital to our food security but the recent antic of the maritime and coastguard agency which be in the name of safety implement new medical rule be leave many inshore fisher at their wit end can it really be right that fisherman in the prime of his work life risk lose his livelihood because he be brave enough few month ago to admit to doctor that he feel anxious do not think it be so will the secretary of state corner his colleague the transport secretary in order to get he to do well than temporary pause on this and to look urgently at exemption for small boat as other country have sensibly do it be great to have cambridgeshire so well represent on these important issue of fishing and farming the shadow minister raise an important point because there have be concern in the fishing sector the minister for food farming and fisheries and have be in touch with department for transport colleague on this issue there have be amendment to the regulation as result of those discussion which be ongoing however we should not alarm people either and the way that the shadow minister characterise this suggest that someone go to their gp and raise an issue and that prevent they from follow their livelihood be not what the regulation do recognise that there have be concern in the sector we be look at they closely and follow they up but the situation be not as he characterise it that would cause undue harm to those in the fishing sector post brexit attempt to recruit domestic worker into agricultural job have not manage to fill exist vacancy leave firm unable to produce at pre brexit level new government rule on migration now put the minimum income requirement for immigrant worker far high than the level currently earn by an agricultural worker in the uk in that context what assessment be he and his department making of the impact that his government draconian immigration policy will have on the security of domestic food production and on the cost and availability of food for consumer as they continue to battle the cost of live crisis to put food on their table of course we will work with colleague in the fishing industry to discuss the impact of the home office perhaps the hon member would like to hear the answer have ask the question that be part of the discussion that we will have it be worth remind the house that for farming the seasonal agricultural worker scheme be separate and be not part of the announcement from home office colleague this week however there will be question from the fishing industry and we stand ready to work with it on those red tractor assurance scheme whether he have have recent discussion with representative of supermarket on their propose change to the red tractor scheme the red tractor assurance scheme be independent and its relationship with food retailer be commercial matter for it separately the government will launch review of the fresh produce sector to understand issue relate to fairness in the supply chain it be important that consumer know about the food they buy thank the secretary of state for that answer as he will be aware although farmer in this country want to comply they be bit concerned that they may be disadvantage compare with foreign producer who do not work to the same standard what assurance can he give to british farmer that he will do everything he can to make sure that supermarket do not disadvantage they can give my hon friend very strong assurance on that front support british farmer be my no priority indeed with the minister for food farming and fisheries in the department we have someone who have lifetime experience of work as farmer we should be proud of the red tractor scheme which be know around the world for be high quality mark of british produce recognise however that concern have be raise and we will launch review soon into fairness in the horticulture supply chain but if necessary will not hesitate to use the power in the relevant act to introduce legislation to tackle contractual unfairness wherever that exist climate change impact on food prices what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for energy security and net zero on the impact of climate change on food price food price depend on range of factor which have recently include russia war in ukraine and the subsequent energy price rise support our world class farmer and food producer and drive down inflation be top priority for the government thank the secretary of state for his response the energy and climate intelligence unit report that energy cost and climate change have push up food bill by an average of over the past two year with climate change drive of that increase we already import billion worth of food from country struggle with extreme weather obviously we want to support those country on an international level with climate adaptation in term of our food security here will the secretary of state review his predecessor decision to secretly scrap the horticulture strategy which could have help domestic grower and make we more resilient to the impact of climate change on food security and food price the hon lady raise an important point about the impact of climate change on food price in the future that be exactly why the government pass the genetic technology precision breeding act to help to unlock innovation and strengthen food security by enable our lead scientist to develop crop that will well resist climate change it be why the government publish the third national adaptation programme as recently as july and it be why we have our farming innovation programme with million of funding which be focus on drive productivity and ensure that there be sustainability in the environmental and farming sector food prices what recent assessment he have make of trend in the level of food price october consumer price index price inflation be down from in september and the low figure since june industry analyst expect food price inflation to continue to decrease and the government be provide an average of per household to help with the cost of live this year and next the minister like the secretary of state before he forget to mention one of the big driver of food inflation in this country will give they clue it start with br and end in exit the reality be that the uk be the only country where food price inflation remain above and the average across oecd country be if this government be not go to follow the snp proposal for price control on food what be they go to do to finally get grip on increase food price think the hon gentleman be mistaken if we compare price in the european union with price here in the uk we see that the price of basket of good here in the uk be substantially low than it be for our friend in the european union if brexit be the problem here surely those price would be high in the uk than they be in the european union think he be bark up the wrong tree british food producers what step he be take to support british food producer the government be commit to support british food producer we be invest billion year in england farming sector and we will also look to support more grower through the replacement of the fruit and vegetable aid scheme for england in the department for environment food and rural affairs also sponsor small and medium sized enterprise

call the shadow minister be grateful for your generosity madam deputy speaker we be just grateful that at least some conservative members have turn up on october over home in chesterfield like hundred across the uk be flood lead to the tragic death of mrs gilbert on tapton terrace less than month later with the impeccable timing that only this accident prone government be capable of the national audit office announce that the government have cut by the number of home that will be protect from flood by will the secretary of state at least promise the house that he will never again say to flood victim that the government be do all they can be sure the whole house extend our condolence on the sad loss of mrs gilbert our investment in flood asset maintenance be up by million as say the previous six year investment be billion between and we be now invest billion yes there have be pressure on the programme through inflation and covid as the national audit office report show but what be not in doubt be the increase funding that this government be put into flood protection the billion indicate that alongside the increase funding for flood maintenance raptor persecution what step he be take to tackle raptor persecution the government take raptor persecution very seriously it be national wildlife crime and there be strong penalty in place for offence commit against bird of prey in defra more than double its funding for the national wildlife crime unit to million over three year in part to target crime of raptor persecution thank the minister for his response there be many long stand tradition that be worth preserve in our countryside but raptor persecution be definitely not one of they it be vile practice and we need to do much more to protect our majestic bird of prey have the minister and the department consider whether introduce vicarious liability would act as deterrent to rogue landowner who direct their gamekeeper to commit wildlife crime as say the government take raptor persecution very seriously and those find guilty of wildlife crime should be subject to the full force of the law defra be work with the national bird of prey crime priority delivery group which bring together the police the government local authority and stakeholder to make sure we be do as much as we can to tackle this type of crime topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility may begin by thank and pay tribute to my predecessor my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey for her work as secretary of state have represent for over year rural constituency that with the cambridgeshire fen be well know for its farming and water management be delighted to be appoint as secretary of state at defra and to be work with strong ministerial team include the new under secretary of state my hon friend the member for keighley robbie moore in the next few day will be travel to to continue the work that be put centre stage at

environment for generation to come welcome the secretary of state to his place my constituent be particularly keen that the uk have the good possible animal welfare standard internationally and they write to ask the secretary of state what progress be be make particularly on livestock and equine welfare animal welfare be an extremely important issue that be why we introduce the animal welfare livestock exports bill in the king speech we be only able to do that because of our exit from the european union it be right that we put in place ban to stop the export of livestock and horse for slaughter my hon friend will also be aware of the two private member bills that be be take forward to tackle the important issue of pet smuggling and pet theft which know be concern to member on both side of the house welcome the secretary of state to his place he will have see the bbc panorama investigation that expose how this conservative government have turn blind eye to corruption and cover up at the heart of the water industry consumer be leave face high water bill while water boss profit from pollution will the secretary of state now back labour plan to let the regulator block any bonus for water boss who be responsible for the tidal wave of sewage pour into our river we can go one well than that in that we have already bring forward measure that allow the regulator ofwat to take action alongside tough penalty now with unlimited fine in addition all storm overflow will be monitor by the end of this year and there will be much tough approach on regulation as the house hear in the strong response to the debate early this week the mayor of greater manchester proposal for square mile clean air charge zone would have be disaster for business in my constituency can my right hon friend provide an update on the government response to the current greater manchester clean air proposal can try but the task of find clarity in the position of the mayor of greater manchester in this regard be somewhat confusing first he say he be in favour of tackle the issue of air quality and indeed we have hear from opposition members how important that be and then when he have power to take action he seem to look to westminster and expect we to act on his behalf of course will follow up my hon friend request and seek clarity from the mayor but the ability to do so have to date be rather limited why have the secretary of state and this conservative government allow water company to increase my constituent bill substantially and pay out million in executive bonus while fail to regulate the industry rampant pollution and the dumping of raw sewage in our waterway in stark contrast to labour commitment to hold those company accountable let we look behind the rhetoric give that the leader of the opposition keep tell we that he want the labour government in wales to be his blueprint it be probably worth our take look at labour record in this respect interruption the hon gentleman ask the question but he do not seem to want to hear about labour record which be not surprising under labour in wales the average number of spill from storm overflow last year be high than the average in england we have introduce unlimited fine and tough regulation and we have set strong target in legislation we can see what labour in power would deliver we can see it in wales increase in storm overflow can the minister give an update on the investigation by the department and the uk health security agency of the recently confirm human case of influenza which be similar to influenza virus currently circulate in pig in the uk do he agree that infectious disease such as this with zoonotic potential underline the importance of the animal and plant health agency to our national

cause only mild illness but the health security agency investigation with support from defra be ongoing we be committed to uphold the uk high level of biosecurity and work be under way with million in the current spending review to safeguard the long term future of weybridge as centre for scientific excellence in tackle high risk disease such as this rise order we have not much time so could we go bit fast with short question and short answer what step have the department take to deliver the measure propose in the national food strategy to encourage the reformulation of food and drink product

issue in my constituency will my hon friend join in praise conservative run harrow council for introduce free waste collection and hour notice of fly tip clear up and indeed increase the number of fine for fly tipping from per year under labour to last year commend the great work that conservative run harrow council be do and pay tribute to my hon friend for bring those point to our attention the new fly tip league table allow central and local government and indeed member of the public to identify council that be take proactive approach to enforcement instead of simply clean up after fly tipper at fly tipper expense successful healthy and sustainable food system require number of factor include consumer base that can afford it recent survey show that of people have remove healthy and organic food from their diet to save money how do the secretary of state plan to cultivate consumer base that will enable people to buy good healthy food my right hon friend the chancellor have set out whole range of method to support consumer with the cost of just as the hon lady raise her hand on that it be also worth remember that under the barnett consequential scotland receive more per head than those consumer in england so those in scotland be well able to meet those cost of living snp member do not seem to like the fact but it be fact that under barnett consequential the funding in scotland be high per head that the funding in england which allow consumer to meet those cost of living pressure and to make those choice should they so wish over the past six week the suffolk and norfolk coast have take real battering home have tragically be lose to the sea not least in pakefield in my constituency will my right hon friend review the support provide to such household and business to ensure that they receive parity of support with those impact by pluvial and fluvial flooding as fellow east of england mp know what fantastic champion my hon friend be for his constituent

conservative party use the pandemic as an opportunity to make money for their friend and donor total billion when will they face justice completely refute what the hon lady have say be look forward to her question but be disappoint with the tone and substance of it it be right to say that this government be take economic crime seriously and fraud as well hope she have see the new fraud strategy and importantly the report commission from jonathan fisher kc and his review on disclosure which be due out next summer the government fraud strategy in may be bill as comprehensive plan to tackle fraud against the public and business so can the attorney general explain why it contain no detail of the number of offence suffer by business no estimate of the loss that result no target in relation to business no measure specific to business and not single mention of the two big type of business fraud procurement and payroll be pleased that the hon gentleman have see the full strategy that be good news repeat my point about jonathan fisher kc who have some important work to do the hon gentleman will understand the volume of crime and the volume of digital material in the serious fraud office jonathan fisher be look at that and at disclosure and that will help business help individual help the country and help the sfo to get on with its job call the chair of the justice committee the solicitor general will recall that back in the justice committee produce report on fraud in the justice system and the step need to improve the way we tackle it welcome number of the change that have be make include the appointment of mr fisher kc but will the solicitor general reflect that one of the area of concern be the type of fraud that be significant cause real loss to business and individual but fall below the level deal with by the sfo there be real concern about the capacity and expertise within police force and the crown prosecution service to tackle that level of fraud which fall into the gap what be the fraud strategy and more broadly what be the government go to do to empower the police and prosecute authority to tackle that sort of fraud be grateful to the chair of the select committee for his question we take all his report seriously especially in this area the cps charge of all fraud matter place before it and have conviction rate of more than will commit to reflect far on this matter the solicitor general will be aware that the home affairs committee have launch review of fraud last week we hear fascinating testimony on romance fraud from the victim of the netflix series the tinder swindler remarkably in her case she be treat as perpetrator investigate by the police and threaten with prosecution even though she have be defraud out of hundred of thousand of pound and be lead merry dance by that chap who be still do what he do then be there not case for bring together law officer ministers the police and the social medium company to ensure that we deal with the victim and the perpetrator accordingly my hon friend always raise serious point and bring to bear his expertise from the home affairs committee there be case for cross government

and germany in duncan mavin book pyramid of lies he subtitle the saga the prime minister the banker and the billion pound scandal amazingly the company be not regulate by the financial conduct authority will the attorney general please look into this massive loophole the scandal could have be stop if the fca have be able to step in early the hon gentleman will understand that the attorney general and superintend both the crown prosecution service and the serious fraud office but that do not mean that we direct how they conduct investigation and nor should we it be right and proper that both organisation conduct their matter independently of government and that will continue far to the question by my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill what guideline be give not only to the police but to the crown prosecution service about the level at which fraud will be investigate as chair of the all party parliamentary group on personal banking and fair financial service have refer number of case that have come to to the police and to the cps and they say that they do not have the resource to investigate they could my hon and learn friend update the house on the position my hon friend be diligent in these matter and he raise an issue that affect we all as constituency mp as we have all have case bring to we that need to be investigate work very closely with both the police and the home office and will continue to do so call the shadow minister in january the then chancellor say that clearly criminal have seek to exploit our covid support scheme and we go to do everything we can to get that money back and go after those who take advantage of the pandemic what proportion of that money have be recover so far how many of those who take advantage have be send to jail first warmly welcome the hon gentleman to his place or rather back to his place as understand that this be his third outing in the shadow ministerial team it be pleasing to see his predecessor the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter whose name be on the order paper we look forward to his question the shadow minister will be interested to know that recently visit the insolvency service which be conduct investigation into the bounce back loan scheme and the like we must remember that the covid lending scheme deliver just under billion of finance in almost record time it be call for from across the house and should be support but he be right that those who have commit fraud should be investigate unduly lenient sentence scheme what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the unduly lenient sentence scheme in my office receive request to review unduly lenient sentence of those be refer to the court of appeal and the sentence be increase in of case welcome much of the work be do as the solicitor general will be aware serve royal navy sailor be the subject of violent attack in torquay when he attempt to stop group of yobs stamp bird to death but the unduly lenient community sentence and small fine hand down do not reflect the gravity of the offence or provide any deterrent what step will the government take to review the unduly lenient sentence scheme to cover case such as that be very grateful to my hon friend for his question know he have have long stand interest in this subject since even before he be member of the house and be grateful to he for hold the government to account he know that the uls scheme the unduly lenient sentence scheme be reserve for the most serious matter it be right to say that we keep the scheme under review can not promise or guarantee to my hon friend any imminent change to it but be very grateful to he for raise that important case could the solicitor general make it clear what the scheme be about and spread the message more broadly regularly write to he to say that sentence have be too lenient recently write to he about bernie ecclestone who think should have be severely punish for his behaviour have also sometimes write to the solicitor general and his predecessor about too severe sentence often involve woman who have not conduct any violent crime but get long sentence can we have balance please well it be thursday and think we have hear call for backbench business debate or indeed for an adjournment debate and would warmly welcome that there have be such debate on the unduly lenient sentence scheme it be not mystery there be further detail online but would seriously welcome further debate to air these matter because they be important the hon gentleman be right to say that the balance between on the one hand unduly lenient sentence and on the other hand manifestly excessive sentence be important and look forward to his application for debate hamas and israel breach of international law if she will hold discussion with cabinet colleague on consult the international criminal court on potential breach of international law in the conflict between hamas and israel know that the hon lady care deeply about the region she and and indeed you madam deputy speaker visit the region together some year ago and know that at the current time all of we will be think about the place we visit and the people we meet in answer to her question the icc start an investigation into the situation in palestine in march thank the attorney general for her response in the light of the brutality and sexual violence perpetrate against israeli civilian by the terrorist of hamas and the scale of the indiscriminate bombing of ten of thousand of palestinians include child in gaza how be she urge the uk government to advocate for the end of the killing to ensure that the international criminal court can gather the most detailed evidence to weigh the action of all party against international law at the early opportunity the prime minister the foreign secretary and indeed the whole of the uk government have consistently urge that international humanitarian law must be follow in this case the icc prosecutor who be british bear barrister karim khan with whom have have number of extremely helpful meeting over the course of my time as attorney general have say that the investigation be ongoing and extend to the escalation of hostility and violence since the attack that take place on october call the spokesman for the scottish national party article of the rome statute say that in relation to the work of the international criminal court state party shall cooperate fully with the court in its investigation and prosecution of crime within the jurisdiction of the court give that in the uk refer russia to the icc can we assume that the uk will comply with any request from the icc for footage from the reconnaissance flight operate over gaza if not what would be the legal basis for refuse an icc request as say the uk support the icc and its chief prosecutor karim khan we do have surveillance flight operate in the region the primary purpose of those be to help with the hostage situation we will say once again that we very much hope that the hostage will be release immediately it be absolutely the case that we will continue to urge all party to continue to abide by international humanitarian law rule of law within government what recent step have she take with cabinet colleague to uphold the rule of law within government what recent step have she take with cabinet colleague to uphold the rule of law within government as emphasise to the house of lords constitution committee in june the rule of law be fundamental to our constitution and it be the duty of the law officer to uphold it will not ask the attorney general to comment on specific legal advice that she have give to colleague know she can not do that but as general point of principle do she agree that the inclusion of notwithstanding clause in legislation can not magic away the international law to which it refer especially if an individual claimant can still assert their right under those international law as the hon gentleman know very well be unable to do away with client confidentiality and give he the specific of any legal advice that may or may not have give take very seriously my obligation to encourage the government to act in lawful manner and to ensure that the government be act in lawful manner both on the domestic front and on the international front while it be pleasure to see my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull east karl turner back in his rightful place on the front bench wonder how long the attorney general will feel able to remain in hers how comfortable be she with the draft safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill which seek to oust the jurisdiction of our high court deny our country international treaty obligation and treat our constitution and the rule of law with contempt she have rightly say that her first duty be as an officer of the court and she have call for respectful relationship between the executive and the court be that why her name do not appear on the face of the bill may start by thank the former shadow solicitor general for his great work while in that post and in particular for his championing of the pro bono movement which know he have always take extremely seriously it have be and remain pleasure to do business with he he know perfectly well well than most that can not give from the dispatch box the detail of legal advice that have be give to the government or of whether or not have be give such advice that remain the case remain very comfortable in my role and hope that will remain in this role to give the government legal advice for long time to come join colleague on both side of the house in welcome the new shadow solicitor general my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull east karl turner to his place be delighted to see his predecessor my hon friend the member for hammersmith andy slaughter still contribute to our debate it be pleasure and blessing to work with both of they as the previous question illustrate there be an intense level of public interest both inside and outside the house about the legal implication of the new rwanda bill while appreciate that there be doctrine of client confidentiality it be nevertheless right to ask the attorney general formally if she will publish her full legal advice on the bill as happen with the brexit withdrawal agreement or summary of the legal position as happen with the northern ireland protocol bill in particular will she set out the advice give to her colleague across government on whether the introduction and implementation of the bill be compatible with their obligation under the ministerial code and the civil service code the right hon lady understand as hope all of we in the chamber do the complication of the law officers convention which mean that simply can not go into the detail of my advice here on very rare occasion either legal advice have be leak or more recently be glad to say summary of the government legal position which may or may not include the attorney general advice have be provide the sort of circumstance in which we would envisage that to be appropriate would be if we be take military action overseas for example it be not something that be do on regular basis what would say to colleague because there have be great deal of interest in the legal position surround the bill be that the use of section statement be not unprecedented in fact remember as much young lawyer when tessa jowell use such statement for the communications act that act go on to be test in the strasbourg court and the government be successful in that case so would not read too much into the use of section statement it be unusual but not unprecedented relate fraud prosecution what recent discussion she have have with the serious fraud office on the prosecution of relate fraud the attorney general and regularly meet with the sfo director however the vast majority of covid fraud case do not fall within the sfo remit and investigation be handle by the most appropriate agency recently as the hon gentleman will have hear visit the insolvency service and hear about its excellent work in relation to bounce bank loan give the statement by the former director of the serious fraud office that red flag be ignore and that parliament own spending watchdog estimate potential fraud of billion how much have be recover to date and what further lesson have be learn and apply to ensure that identification and prevention of fraud be embed across all government departments and why be the uk government not recover that fraud with the same zeal and determination that they have for impoverish benefit claimant who have have overpayment through no fault of their own entirely refute and disagree with the hon gentleman final comment but he will be pleased to know that the new director of the sfo have set off apace he have launch new investigation there be new energy and new rigour within the sfo but repeat that it be not just the sfo that conduct such investigation the insolvency service be also involve and be also carry out some excellent work small boat crossing prosecution rate what step she be take to increase prosecution rate for small boat gang and other people trafficker early this year the attorney general and visit western jet foil and the joint control room in dover to discuss the illegal migration act the number of small boat crossing be down by third this year and we be see an increase in the number of prosecution since the introduction of the nationality and borders act yesterday the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill be lay before the house it would disapply the human rights act for those seek sanctuary that undermine the uk international reputation and international law the home secretary say yesterday at the dispatch box that the attorney general make it clear that the bill be in conformity with international law so can he confirm that that advice be give and how be it mean to impact small boat crossing and prosecution the hon gentleman have kindly be present throughout question time so he will know that can not confirm or deny whether advice be even seek let alone give let alone its content his question be about small boat crossing which government members be determined to stop be disappoint that he do not support our nationality and borders act which prosecute the people trafficker that be the substance of his question look forward to his reading the bill in more detail and support it in due course refurbishing train contract urgent question to ask the secretary of state for transport if he will make statement on expedite the contract process for refurbish exist uk train thank the hon member for his question which will answer on behalf of the secretary of state the department work closely with roll stock owner and train operator to understand when new and refurbish

transport have hold regular meeting with senior management at alstom we have also convene cross whitehall group to advise on way to support continued production at derby and how good to support those worker who could lose their job the fact remain that the market for passenger train be competitive the department can not guarantee order for individual manufacturer none the less we expect substantial continued demand for new train last month lner confirm an order of new tri mode train for the east coast main line and on monday tender for new train for the transpennine express route be launch contract award be also expect between late and early for major order for southeastern northern and chiltern in the meantime the government will continue to work with alstom and other uk manufacturer to ensure strong and sustainable future for the rail industry thank you madam deputy speaker for grant this question on matter of some urgency thank the minister for his response and must impress upon he and the house that the secretary of state must expedite the contract bidding process for update exist uk train to ensure the survival of the uk base train manufacturing industry without immediate plan to allow company to bid for new contract make no mistake thousand of skilled job in the uk will go the urgency stem from the crucial role of the alstom factory in derby it be the uk only end to end design build and test train manufacturing facility make it integral to the uk rail manufacturing industry some people currently work directly at alstom and job in the supply chain rely on the factory continue production nick crossfield alstom manage director give evidence to the transport committee yesterday and he be absolutely clear that the government need to decide now on how and where they want train to be make in the future if this government do not expedite the bidding process train will not continue to be manufacture in the uk they will start to be manufacture in north america south america or east asia alstom current and final contract for roll stock be on the elizabeth line and be due to expire in six week that could mean an end to the rail manufacturing industry in the uk as we know it yesterday meet unite the union of which be proud member and rail worker from alstom site in derby and they ask for our help in retain their job also just yesterday two of the supply chain company that supply alstom go into liquidation due to the uncertainty over future order from the alstom factory time on this issue have never be more crucial may

site when it be formerly own by bombardier as part of transport committee delegation that support be assure also make the point that be meet unite the union next week it have be in touch and will be pleased to work with it and everyone to see what more can be do to keep that plant open call the chair of the select committee know that the minister be great advocate of the work of the transport committee and strongly urge he to look at the transcript of the evidence we receive yesterday from not just alstom but other in the rail industry the fact be that the medium and long term prospect for the sector be positive what we be face be short term lull impress on he the urgency of work with the roll stock company rosco and other to try to bring forward some refurbishment contract that alstom and other can bid for to help smooth out these peak and trough in the sector thank my hon friend the chair of the select committee for the work he do that evidence session be particularly pertinent for highlight the matter he allow that committee to raise can assure he that the secretary of state write to roll stock owner in september to encourage they to discuss with train operator and manufacturer opportunity to ease short term challenge in the supply chain such as refurbishment or major overhaul we recognise the issue and have ask other to do their good to deliver on that declare that be member of unite the union and meet with trade union member yesterday the urgency of this matter can not be overstate the clock be tick and those job will be consult on in the very near future if contract can not be find the minister write in september but what have he be do over the past three month to bring forward contract that will enable the plant to remain open as have mention we have write to ask roll stock owner what more action they can take just on monday be up in yorkshire for the announcement of an extra billion in funding for the transpennine route upgrade that also start the tendering process for new rolling new train with an option for another and as mention we be look for the tender process for southeastern chiltern and northern to go forward as well so order be be put into the pipeline for train manufacturer from the generous time he have give on this subject my hon friend will know that overcrowding on the chiltern line persist to very serious degree because the age of the roll stock regularly lead to chiltern have to run very short train on the main line train that some people can not even get on in the first place as he look at this important subject will my hon friend do all he can to ensure that chiltern can get train refurbish and get new train into the pipeline as soon as possible my hon friend be champion for the chiltern line and he do indeed bend my ear on that subject he be right to do so because that line be get busy now which be positive that tendering process will be bring into be next year we want to see chiltern train and that process should allow they to be deliver we be not ask the secretary of state to give one company special treatment over another should say that be also member of unite the union but believe that the retention of british manufacturing capacity have to be regard as strategically important for the united kingdom will he allow we to go forward by grant all company the opportunity to bid on new rail upgrade plan such as crossrail southeastern and even the extensive network north plan time be of the essence and swift action from the government can make significant difference in secure the future of the uk rail manufacturing industry can give the hon member that assurance we will be bring those contract tender forward we now have four train manufacturer which be to be celebrate we have caf in south wales we have hitachi up in the north east we have alstom of course in derby and now we have siemens in goole all those manufacturer be bid and the hon member be absolutely right that there must be fair process for all which will take place it be not that long ago that we have the hat pacer train on the furness line we be very glad to see the back of those but of course new shiny train be no good if it be not run the minister mention that if we be not see customer demand that be go to hurt the industry so could he speak to what the government be do to improve customer service and get the level of train service back up to where my constituent hope it will be we be aware that performance need to be lot well than it be currently not just from train manufacturer but from network rail indeed be due to meet with the train operator this morning to discuss that issue obviously have have to move that meeting but be very happy to meet with my hon friend so that can take his particular point into account we need to do more call the shadow minister the alstom litchurch lane factory in derby have be build train for over century since the dawn of train travel it have provide high skilled job for the local community for generation and help support other local company that form part of its supply chain and as britain big train building plant it play pivotal role in support the growth of the midland and our country manufacturing sector follow the government chaos and indecision over and the lack of long term strategy hundred of highly skilled job at the plant be at risk with no confirm workload beyond the first quarter of and contract to build train for push back until create gap in order this news will be deeply worry for those affect and their family in the run up to christmas it will also be extremely concern for local business that rely on the factory and the wide rail sector and for the people of derby the worker at alstom have only day to get decision out of the minister before their livelihood be put at risk time be up they deserve to hear from the minister how this have be allow to happen and what action the government be take to pursue deal to secure the derby plant and ensure that as many job be protect as possible what urgent clarity can the government provide alstom on the short term roll stock pipeline include possible refurbishment be pleased that the minister confirm that he will be meet representative from unite the union and hope that he will commit to work with they to safeguard job when can the factory finally get certainty on order so that it can plan for the future and secure job how many more rail manufacturing job across the country be at risk follow the government recent decision on early this year derby be name the government home of great british railways just seven month on the future of its landmark factory be in danger at the heart of this be the chaos and indecision of the conservative party the minister owe the people of derby and the country an explanation of what he plan to do to stop the prime minister fiasco lead to more job loss will if may deal with the matter of head on the shadow rail minister make that same point say that this be somehow link to and it have now be make from the dispatch box today the secretary of state respond to the shadow rail minister so shall put this on the record with regard to he say can assure you this be not the case alstom be part of contract with hitachi to design build and maintain train for phase one only phase one of between birmingham and london will continue that position have be reiterate by alstom chief executive gently point out to the hon member for wakefield simon lightwood that this have nothing to do with that have be establish and it be erroneous to claim otherwise the hon member also have to bear in mind that we now have four train manufacturer we can not just award contract to one manufacturer there have to be fair tender process for all the job across all four plant the department for transport have win case bring by one of the other train manufacturer demonstrate that our tendering process be fair my hon friend refer in his opening statement to new order from transpennine he will be aware that there be severe overcrowding on the cleethorpes manchester liverpool service because the train have be reduce from six carriage to three in recent month can he enlighten as to when the new stock will be come forward as it will greatly please my constituent hope my hon friend constituent will be comfort by the order because it be not just an order for new transpennine express train but complete upgrade of the transpennine route the uk government be spend more money on the transpennine upgrade than be spend on the elizabeth line and that will mean deliver well service be with the manage director of transpennine train on monday up in yorkshire and we be discuss just that we need to improve the service and the roll stock upgrade to our train must include electrification but electrification be at standstill with only mile of track be electrify this year east west rail will not be electrify as standard and dirty diesel train be still go through bath will the minister commit to long term plan for electrification the prime minister network north plan do just that electrification for hull between sheffield and manchester and between sheffield and leeds they be vast project not small project with regard to east west rail that be the upgrade of an exist line which have its bridge size all the way through from winslow to bletchley so it be difficult to put electrification on to that part let remind the hon lady that there have be more than mile of electrification in the past year compare with just over mile in the year before that think that be pretty good record too have meet worker from the alstom plant in derby and as unite member myself representative of unite as well it be pleasing to hear that worker representative and management be unite in their desire to retain good high skilled manufacturing job and train production there want to press the minister again about recognise the importance of retain the only end to end train production facility in the uk during this short term blip in production so to speak do he agree that this investment in public transport be vital if we want to tackle the net zero challenge we face the hon lady be correct that be vital the challenge and it be good challenge be that we now have four manufacturer and we need to help they with international order that be why sometimes go abroad with trade envoy from those company to export around the globe the average age of our roll stock be down to just under year six year ago it be year and as it get fresher there be challenge with pipeline as well however we be bring contract forward so that we can fill the order book well as derbyshire member of parliament can tell the minister that there be huge concern about the future of alstom think it be perfectly reasonable to say that the government have lack strategic direction on rail they have go from one project to another and in the last few year there have be no sense of an industrial strategy when we have have these debate in the past ministers be always blame the eu and say we could not support british manufacturing because of the eu we be now out of the eu and it seem to that country such as germany be much well at support their manufacturing can we have real sense of urgency from the minister and an indication that the government be go to make sure strategically that these job be save assure the hon member that the secretary of state in particular have be meet alstom and our official and our director general meet alstom include with representative will be do so on tuesday week we will do everything we can to assist but this be commercial matter for the operator as have mention have be to that plant with the transport committee and see what it do for the workforce and for the supply chain we will be do everything we can to assist alstom in keep that plant open thank the minister for his answer with many of my constituent dependent on government help and support for manufacturing industry can well understand union fear at the dithering and the effect on the workforce it be necessary to refurbish number of train so can the minister outline how the government will ensure that the much need refurbishment contract can be organise to keep people in work rather than pay out redundancy money to they only to rehire they six month later when thing be arrange properly that be the desire of every member of this house yes indeed as have mention we be bring forward order and the secretary of state have write to the company that finance train manufacturing and refurbishment to ask what more they can do to bring forward that refurbishment at the risk of repeat myself the challenge we have and it be good challenge be that we have four fine train manufacturer and we have roll stock that be young than it previously be so the aim be to try to get order out which we be do but reiterate that it be also important that we help our train manufacturer export order across the globe so that they can manufacture not just for home but for abroad and keep those job go cyber interference uk democracy with permission will make statement about attempt cyber interference in british democracy know hon and right hon member across this house will recognise the seriousness of this issue the government have long highlight the threat to the uk and our ally from malicious cyber activity conduct by the russian intelligence service can confirm today that the russian federal security service the fsb be behind sustained effort to interfere in our democratic process it have target member of this house and the other place it have be target civil servant journalist and non government organisation it have be target high profile individual and entity with clear intent use information it obtain to meddle in british politic madam deputy speaker you and parliamentary security have be brief on the detail of that activity we want to be as open as we can with the house and the british public our commitment to transparency stand in sharp contrast to the effort of the kgb successor to exert influence from the shadow what can we confirm today want to stress five particular point of our assessment first centre unit within russia fsb have be involve in range of cyber espionage operation target the uk secondly star blizzard cyber group that the national cyber security centre assess be almost certainly subordinate to centre be responsible for range of malign activity target british parliamentarian from multiple party thirdly use those mean the group have selectively leak and amplify the release of sensitive information in service of russia goal of confrontation in when he be foreign secretary my right hon friend the member for esher and walton dominic raab confirm to the house that russia have do that before the election with document relate to uk us trade can now confirm that we know star blizzard be involve in this operation fourthly these cyber actor use combination of target tailor their operation in far more sophisticated way than be usually the case with for instance commonplace cyber criminal they typically engage in thorough research and preparation include via social medium and network platform have thus identify way to engage target they create false account impersonate contact to appear legitimate and create believable approach seek to build rapport before deliver malicious link to either document or website of interest while they have target business and corporate email the group predominantly target personal email address finally the targeting of this group be not limit to politician but include public face figure and institution of all type we have see impersonation and attempt to compromise email account across the public sector university medium non governmental organisation and wide civil society many of those individual and organisation play vital role in our democracy as an example the group be responsible for the hack of the institute for statecraft uk think tank whose work include initiative to defend democracy against disinformation and the more recent hack of its founder whose account be compromise from in both case document be subsequently leak the government assessment be base on extensive analysis from the uk intelligence community and support by range of close international partner today ally from the five eyes and the euro atlantic region be join we in illuminate the pervasive nature of this threat to our share democratic value pay tribute to the dedicated public servant in our own agency and those of our partner whose painstaking work have allow we to expose the reality of the threat we face take together the uk government judge that these action demonstrate clear and persistent pattern of behaviour russia attempt interference in political and democratic process through cyber or any other mean be unacceptable reassure the house that we have identify target of parliamentary colleague and engage with victim through both the national cyber security centre and the parliamentary authority the government will continue to expose and respond to malign cyber activity hold russia accountable for its action to that end the uk have designate two individual under the uk cyber sanction regime follow thorough investigation by the national crime agency into the hack of the institute for statecraft in do so we send clear message that these action have consequence this morning the foreign commonwealth and development office have summon the russian ambassador to the foreign office to convey that message we have robust system in place to protect against the threat from foreign malign influence the minister for security my right hon friend the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat lead the defend democracy taskforce which drive work to improve our resilience against these threat our national cyber security centre alongside five eyes partner today publish technical advisory to provide guidance to organisation and individual at risk of be target to help defend against such attack we will continue to defend ourselves from adversary who seek to threaten the freedom that underpin our democracy it be and always will be an absolute priority to protect our democracy and election key component of increase our resilience be support the national cyber security centre and parliamentary authority to deliver an enhanced cyber security offer to right hon and hon member and to member of the other place that aim to well protect they against this insidious threat and support the resilience of our lively democratic society we hope that this statement help to raise awareness of the threat and allow those in public life in this house and beyond to recognise how they may be target by such operation russia have long establish track record of reckless indiscriminate and destabilising malicious cyber activity with impact feel all over the world in recent year the government have alongside ally uncover numerous instance of russian intelligence target of critical national infrastructure for example we have work in close co ordination with our intelligence partner to expose sophisticated cyber espionage tool aim at sensitive target the irony of russia abuse the freedom that it deny its own people to interfere in our politic will not be lose on anyone of course our political process and institution have endure in spite of those attack but the cyber threat pose by the russian intelligence service be real and serious all right hon and hon member should pay careful attention to it in the course of their work and their daily life many in this house may not consider themselves potential victim want to underline to the whole house that the targeting can be extremely convincing we must all play our part in exercise good cyber practice use appropriate caution and follow the good guidance of the national cyber security centre and other to mitigate the threat that be how we defend ourselves and our precious democracy commend this statement to the house call the shadow foreign secretary be grateful to the minister for advance sight of his statement the news that the russian intelligence service be behind an effort to target member of this house and the other place civil servant journalist and ngos be not just concern it be an attack not only on individual but on british democracy on both side of this house and on the public we represent labour along with the whole house condemn it in the strong term the news come as we approach the year of election not only in britain but in the united states india and the eu with more than election schedule in country across the world democracy be build on trust and trust must be build on the confidence that politician on all side be able to conduct the business of democracy free from interference let ask the minister some specific question about these revelation first be he confident that the government have uncover the full extent of the cyber attack and every person who be affect secondly on the response welcome the announcement of the designation of two individual follow the hack of the institute for statecraft but have any specific action be take to respond to the cyber attack on parliamentarian that the minister have reveal today if not why not thirdly as we approach the general election what additional step be the government take to ensure the integrity of the democratic process will they make their official available to ensure that member on both side of this house be free from interference to train equip and support member and all staff to well identify and respond to the challenge and to ensure not just that their digital communication be protect but that their office staff and family be too this revelation be shocking but not unexpected it be the late episode in long pattern of hostile activity by russia and other hostile state include iran and the democratic people republic of korea against britain and our ally there be more that we can do labour have commit to the establishment of democratic resilience centre in government to work with our ally to protect our democratic value political institution election and open society will the government commit to create one as the shadow home secretary my right hon friend the member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper have outline we do not yet have robust and long last equivalent of the cross government counter terrorism strategy contest for deal with hostile state will the government commit to create one labour have propose joint cell between the home office and the foreign office to speed up decision making share intelligence and expertise and remove traditional barrier between departments will the government commit to create one they still have not amend terror legislation to allow the government to ban hostile state sponsor organisation that be undermine our national security will they commit to do so the russia report have still not be fully implement will the government urgently update the house on when that will be complete this be not just about cyber attack and direct digital interference it be about wide malign activity include the use of artificial intelligence and deepfake to seed false narrative spread lie and foment division that include the widespread use of disinformation misinformation and malinformation to undermine our democracy through mainstream and social medium and other mean labour have commit to urgently introduce bind regulation of company develop the most powerful frontier ai which could be use to disrupt election will the government commit to do so too will they also commit to ensure adequate resourcing for the national cyber security centre the intelligence agency and the defend democracy taskforce give the minister every assurance that the labour party will work in partnership and full co operation with the government and all relevant authority to take every necessary step to address this threat and protect the integrity of our political process from hostile interference as politician from different party we have all stand unite across the house against putin imperial aggression in ukraine that unity be source of strength and pride in the face of these threat this house must remain united britain must remain united and democracy must remain united in defence of our institution and against those who seek to undermine the great value that our society be found upon be grateful for the tone and constructive content of the right hon gentleman response he be right to say that be bumper year of election involve some election and billion of people across country this be matter of trust and confidence which be why we have make this statement now to ensure that its full deterrent effect be properly time the right hon gentleman ask whether we be confident that we have uncover the full extent of the activity we have high degree of confidence with regard to this specific incident but of course it be question and our duty be to remain ever vigilant the lesson of this sort of activity be that high degree of vigilance be necessary and that be the posture that we now maintain in term of any future activity be grateful that the right hon gentleman welcome the designation specific action have be take by the ncsc in accordance and together with house authority to ensure that all of the individual affect have high degree of preventive measure in place the posture of the house authority and the security offer available have be enhance however as have say it be matter of improve vigilance on all side as for additional step we might take there be the collective deterrent impact of our naming and sham these individual and designate they in our sanction as well as the diplomatic effort to call russia out combine with personal cyber security measure on behalf of individual those important step that all colleague need to take the right hon gentleman ask about the whitehall structure in this area and point to his own policy of call for joint cell we be confident that the defend democracy taskforce lead by the security minister represent robust and cross departmental response on the wide picture of disinformation the right hon gentleman be right to say that we need to up our game to counter disinformation call russia out and well resource and energise our own security posture in the cyber domain that have be do there be an enhanced degree of resource organisation and political will this public statement today be part of the hugely important deterrent effect the intelligence and security committee be one of the first to sound the alarm on this issue in its russia report more recently we have highlight the risk that china pose through interference in democratic discourse for example in think tank and university will the minister update the house on what action the government be take in response to the recommendation make in those two substantial report my right hon friend make very good point clearly this statement be about russia but she draw comparison with the activity of china that be an appropriate reference and be pleased that in our domestic legislation we have the ability to ensure that country with malign intent do not use think tank or other front to influence domestic political discourse in way that be contrary to the health of our democracy call the scottish national party spokesperson thank the minister for prior sight of his statement it make for disturb reading and absolutely agree that russia action be completely unacceptable that member of this house and other have have their email account hack be deeply concern but we know that this have happen before indeed it be probably happen right now and we must accept that it will almost certainly happen again as the minister say russia action demonstrate clear and persistent pattern of behaviour give that have the government consider make cyber security training mandatory for all mp and their staff he will be aware of the belief that one of our weak link in our cyber defence be our staff who be constantly target by unscrupulous external actor although they be not house employee it would be reasonable precaution for mps staff to receive in house training on exactly what to look out for how to avoid get suck into trap and what they should do if they have even the slight suspicion that they be be target democracy be under attack just last week the canadian government communications security establishment release new report on cyber threat to election say that at least quarter of national election around the world be target by some manner of threat and that china and russia be the most active country and be launch increasingly sophisticated influence operation by spread disinformation and seek to push election in specific direction perhaps most worryingly the canadian report state in relation to ai undermine election we assess it very likely that the capacity to generate deepfake exceed our ability to detect they with mp face have their email hack the democratic process be undermine and the uk general election just around the corner what be the government do to proactively defend the integrity of those election and when can the house expect to hear about it be grateful for the hon gentleman comment and question he be absolutely right about the scale of the threat alongside our call russia out and describe the nature of the threat it be important that we point out that russia have fail in its intent to undermine our domestic politic it be genuine attempt that fail and we be now more aware and resilient that be why we be call russia out but we should also be proud that the institution of our democracy remain resilient russia have fail in its effort and it will continue to fail because we will continue to call it out the hon gentleman make very good point about staff training do not think we should mandate that but we have work on much enhance offer to ensure that cyber security be root and branch part of the normal working practice of mps and staff that offer have radically improve the house authority will continue to keep colleague up to date high degree of awareness in our working practice be very important and that be part of the rationale behind today statement welcome my hon friend update be sure that be not alone in have receive large number of template email on particular subject when have diligently write back to those individual they have say that they do not send the email it be quite clear that hostile actor be collect our constituent email address and use they to subvert the democratic process will my hon friend take the message not only back to the foreign office but across the house that this need to be investigate and stop my hon friend make very good point this practice use email to insert malware or to entice user to click on malicious link be sometimes extremely convincing staff have to deal with great volume of such email which be why we be pleased that the house authority have great awareness staff should seek guidance from the house authority on take more secure approach the minister contribute to very good debate in the uk eu parliamentary partnership assembly which meet in westminster early this week and touch on some of these issue we be clearly deal with hybrid warfare there be no other phrase for it although commend the minister for come to the house to give we this information the response of sanction two people seem rather mild will he say more about that will he also say something about the co ordination across western democracy and ally on next year year of election we must all co ordinate so that we can spot pattern in order to deal with this threat the hon lady should be reassure that although today announcement pertain to two individual it be indicative of huge and sustained institutional effort to tackle this threat by way of vastly improve defensive cyber capability right across our nation our global response be work hand in glove with five eyes partner and there be huge diplomatic and security effort to make sure this activity be call out and pursue that be not just deterrence it be also enhance resilience although the number of individual be small the hon lady should be reassure that the institutional work be tremendously well resource and entirely determined thank the minister for his statement be incredibly grateful to the speaker office the security minister and the house authority for their work to increase our awareness and to improve our protection within parliament but we be in very privileged position frankly the fabric of our society that be most at risk be those part that do not have access to such information whether they be small and medium sized enterprise that supply critical national infrastructure whether they be the part of the economy that keep we go or indeed whether they be those who protect our election will the minister speak little about what protection and information will be offer to they so that they can support we my hon friend make very good point this affect we all it not only affect parliamentarian or those in public life it affect those in commerce the national cyber security centre have publish guidance and be available to provide guidance to those business that need to ensure they have high degree of security and resilience particularly those involve in for example critical national infrastructure this be refreshing statement but what action will be take this be very serious challenge to our democracy indeed it be not only serious challenge to member of parliament know of major takeover of british company by chinese entity the senior executive say that when they attend meeting the chinese know information about the company its secret and its background that they could have know only by illegal mean it be everywhere and it be particularly come from russia china and perhaps iran and north korea can we have action yes we need to train our staff and member of parliament but be brainwash as child by the james bond novel maybe you be too madam deputy speaker we have wonderful intelligence system but be our intelligence service up to the job do they need more resource the hon gentleman ask about action it be good question and can give good answer in term of our domestic legislation we be now thankfully in position to ensure that foreign country with malign intent can not freely invest in critical national infrastructure without the permission and outside the purview of ministers minister have take specific action to ensure that divestment have take place in certain commercial entity where national interest be at stake and that will continue to be the case the government posture have alter radically in recent year and we should all be encourage by that the hon gentleman make welcome reference to james bond of course it be the government policy never to comment on the security service but can ensure the hon gentleman that they be up to speed and very well resource this be shocking but not at all surprising we have hear before about possible interference in the brexit referendum and then we have the russia report which be not implement we be on the cusp of general election which may come soon rather than later so my question to the minister be what conversation be be have with the electoral commission and the political party because it be not just mps we need to think about but candidate also what plan do he have to take whole of society approach so that voter can build resilience and our democratic process and the ballot be completely secure the hon lady make good point and ask good question the threat be significant but should reiterate that it have fail which think point to the resilience of our democratic institution that do not mean that we should not be eternally vigilant we will be that work involve all party across the house and candidate lot of the preventive work be be carry out by the defending democracy taskforce which be specifically look at this issue under the security minister the hon lady should be reassure that they have the bit between their tooth thank the minister for his statement what we have see be malevolent behaviour and be glad to hear some of the government plan however labour be committed to establish democratic resilience centre so can press the minister to ensure that the government consider follow our lead that work be already in place under the defending democracy taskforce and the wholly re energised and newly found national cyber security centre establish under this government with tremendous resource and energy whatever we call it there be now significant effort to ensure that we deter these thing and that mps and everyone across the political spectrum be in much more secure position as new member of this house obviously find this statement concern will the minister therefore outline some of the additional support that can be offer to new member and their staff particularly because there be lot to navigate there be an induction process which welcome because it have help very much but there be about minute on cyber security so it definitely could do with be update the hon lady make good point and she be absolutely right an improved and enhance offer be be work up together with the house authority cyber security and cyber hygiene should be default daily practice all colleague should be aware of the offer and it should be make available to all colleague and staff thank the minister very much for his statement our government have be preppe for cyber warfare for some time indeed the rationale behind lessen investment in recruitment into the armed force have be that cyber warfare be big threat that be the case will the minister confirm that the government be prepare to act should these newspaper claim have even slither of truth how can we send the message today that the uk be prepared to face the cyber threat as readily as any other threat we be well place the threat be significant and the risk to national resilience be significant in the cyber age the deputy prime minister have lead huge amount of work on national resilience defensive cyber be an important part of that and the national cyber security centre have an important role to play the challenge be huge but the government have cover huge amount of ground however there be more work to do thank the minister for his statement business of the house the business for the week commence december will include the following monday december second reading of the leasehold and freehold reform bill tuesday december second reading of the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill wednesday december second reading of the finance bill thursday december general debate on knife crime follow by general debate on the

two labour giant who have pass away in the past week alistair darling be one of the guide hand in the last labour government he be one of only three ministers who serve in the cabinet throughout the entire period most notably as chancellor during the global economic crisis his calm decisive and comprehensive response help to save our economy and his leadership rightly earn he global and cross party plaudit glenys kinnock whose later year be steal by the awful effect of alzheimer will be remember for her political leadership alongside neil but also very much in her own right for social justice woman right and international development glenys be true sister who support and encourage generation of woman into politic include and our dear friend jo cox our thought be with their family so madam deputy speaker what mess as the home secretary finally unveil his rwanda bill the immigration minister resign in disgust emergency legislation and now an emergency reshuffle and as we speak an emergency press conference it be total chaos the government be now in freefall unable to govern and all the while family be worried about pay their bill and afford christmas the prime minister be so weak that he can not convince his own side satisfy no one and inflame they all we all want to stop the boat but many on the government benches now agree with we that this plan be unworkable unlike the home secretary yesterday perhaps the leader of the house can tell we how the plan will work how many illegal migrant will be send to rwanda the treaty say that the number be cap and the small print say that it be just people what be the extent of our reciprocal arrangement to take refugee from rwanda will we take more from rwanda than we be send there and when will this happen the northern ireland secretary do not have clue this morning will the leader of the house confirm that anyone who lose the right to remain in rwanda for example those who commit serious criminal offence must be return to the uk we now learn that it be the rwandan government who insist that international law must be uphold be it the government view that international treaty do need to be overridden the home secretary could not say how the treaty and the bill deal with appeal and legal challenge can the leader of the house assure we that this policy will not get clog up in the court all over again the prime minister do not convince people just now can the leader of the house commit herself to publish the government estimate of the cost of this plan the prime minister have just say at his press conference that he want the bill to be pass in record time so why will it not go into committee before christmas the answer be that he can not persuade his own side let say this to the leader of the house the truth be that this plan will not work know it she know it they know it that be why the immigration minister resign and that be why he say that these measure be triumph of hope over experience that be why the former home secretary the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman say this morning that the truth be that it will work and it will not stop the boat she also say we can keep fail the british people this be now the third piece of legislation in two year all try and fail to do the same thing it be the very definition of flog dead horse but it be not just the policy that be dead but the whole sorry government fail divided defunct and incapable of govern finally in further evidence of the government death throe this week the prime minister suffer his first commons defeat over the infected blood scandal so off be their judgment that they could not even support measured reasonable amendment from my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson to set up body to administer compensation immediately as recommend by sir brian langstaff who lead the inquiry on reflection do the leader of the house not think that they have just get this one badly wrong and will she now ensure that this amendment survive the passage of the bill in fact the government former paymaster general tell the infected blood inquiry believe it to be inevitable that the government will need to provide substantial compensation believe we should begin prepare for this now before the inquiry report add that it be moral obligation that minister write to the now prime minister then the chancellor twice to press their case never to get reply that minister be now the leader of the house so can she tell we do she still agree with herself join the hon lady in pay tribute and send my sympathy to the family of alistair darling and glenys kinnock do not know glenys kinnock but do know alistair little and we will miss his very dry sense of humour be sure that all our thought be with their friend and family also wish mr speaker speedy recovery will also take this opportunity to wish jewish people around the world happy hanukkah it be festival of light overcome darkness and that be as relevant today as it be thousand of year ago know the celebration will be more difficult this year for everyone but also know that jewish people across this country will celebrate over these eight day as symbol of jewish pride be sure all in this place will want to wish everyone celebrate chag hanukkah sameach the hon lady raise the important matter of the infected blood scandal and she be right be the minister who set up the compensation scheme feel it important that it run concurrently with the inquiry rather than have to wait until the inquiry report and then set up that piece of work sir robert francis have do very good job and the minister for the cabinet office be now do the heavy lifting on put the scheme together have meet with he on several occasion and know he be completely committed to that and be work hard on it point out to the hon lady that could not have get the compensation scheme study establish without the blessing of the chancellor at the time that person be now prime minister and know that he be committed to deliver on it want to reassure all those who be infect and affect by the scandal that this government have not only establish an inquiry after many decade of this injustice be do but establish compensation study we have do that for reason because we wish to deliver and bring justice to this group of people we be the first government to have do that and if we can do that in short order think that would be something to be very proud of it be great to see the labour party channel the right of the conservative party channel mrs thatcher recently on border on fiscal responsibility and on her crusade for worker wealth creator carer and protector unfortunately the party be simultaneously plot to destroy all that she build and stand for know margaret thatcher and can tell the hon lady that the leader of the opposition be no margaret thatcher it will take rather more than light perm pearl and handbag for he to pull off that look he will need to get backbone he will need to get some principle he will need to rethink the labour party stance on our rwanda policy and our border control he will need to rethink borrow billion more he might also like to stand up for the public and support our minimum service level agreement he might like to reject the demand of the tuc which want to repeal all the reform that maggie bring in he might like to call out the british medical association cruel plan to cancel operation and cancel christmas for thousand of elderly people in care he might like to call out the immoral ask of union to transport worker who will have to forgo pay over christmas in fairness the great lady do say you turn if you want to and labour leader have jolly well do so several time on his leadership pledge and on almost every policy announce since he become leader if she be the iron lady he be the ironic man the hon lady ask about rwanda pay tribute to the work of my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick he help the prime minister reduce boat crossing by third in the last year more than any minister and prime minister have achieve we must ensure that our asylum and immigration system be fit for purpose and we must protect and control our border the public be right in their demand that we do so the treaty and the legislation will enable we to operationalise the rwanda policy will they be enough to do all we need to do no but we will have other tool as well will they help to give we more option and to deter people from make the terrible crossing across the channel yes they will the opposition have put forward no alternative plan my question to they be what be the objection it can not be legal one because the policy do not break international law and nor do it blur the distinction between lawmaker and those who interpret the law it can not be moral objection because it be moral crusade to use every tool that we have to end the trafficking of human being it can not be policy objection because the labour party have no alternative policy it have vote against every single measure that we have introduce to protect our border it vote against the last bill more than time labour have fight we on end free movement and the deportation of foreign criminal and it have say it would take an additional people per year from europe as say ironic last night the labour lead administration at staffordshire moorlands district council vote to increase council allowance by at cost of to council tax payer will my right hon friend find time for debate about local authority spending and how we can make sure that council tax payer get value for money as my right hon friend ask her question there be audible gasp across the chamber that be an incredible lack of local political leadership council tax payer in her district will be disappoint to hear that news if she be to apply for debate be sure that it would be well attend be sure that everyone would urge restraint and want to ensure the good value possible for people hard earn cash call the scottish national party spokesperson it be tempting to forestall and dismantle now any spin that the leader of the house may be incline to bring up on scottish education issue give westminster shocking record follow her outburst against scotland health service worker last week must clear up some thing scotland watch her odd weekly rant as the scottish press dub they with concern and alarm let give some useful fact for she and scotland about the scottish nhs health funding be at record high staffing level be also at record high with far more staff per head than england we have the good perform unit and the high number of gps per head in the uk no prescription charge and still not single day lose to industrial dispute in the scottish nhs there be always room for improvement but as the leader of the house reach for her late penny dreadful script she can rest assure that will be happy to set the record straight wherever her imagination take she meanwhile the government plumb new depth with their immigration panic measure which be so damaging to scotland in particular the daily telegraph columnist tim stanley have write friend have message in blind panic if they fall in love and marry someone from overseas must they have an income of to settle here he go on to say something like of we earn less than that be it fair to limit family formation to the rich be it conservative to divide family of course it be fine if someone be rich so maybe it be if we our child or our grandchild fall in love with someone from another country many of we do so on our travel be live proof of that they will not be able to join we here unless we have guarantee earning near cue further exodus of our young people from these shore to other country with more enlightened approach to migration and their citizen human right even bad those who have already go through the process and who think that they have win the right to live here in peace will have to come up with that figure the next time their visa be extend should parliament not have debate these extreme measure first can the leader of the house defend this shameful policy or be she and other ministers threaten to resign thank the hon lady would ask she to go and have look at the snp record on education have speak about that in the last two business question session so shall not detain the house any long on it think everyone in this chamber be aware of the snp appalling record on destroy the education system in scotland the only people who be not be those in charge of it the hon lady mention the nhs and pay settlement and the theme of her question be really value and morality do she think it would be moral if government deny fast nhs treatment to its citizen post covid because they do not want to send they to an english hospital understand that the former health secretary make that offer to the first minister and it be reject be it moral to offer pay deal as she boast to public sector worker include nhs worker without plan to pay for it come to think of it be it moral to withhold fund designate for business rate relief from business would she describe it as moral if government deny their citizen the ability to have civil partnership she speak of relationship with their opposite sex partner for year include those who be terminally ill because they do not want the uk government to legislate on their behalf while the hon lady be look up the snp record on education would ask she also to check how many concurrent police investigation there be into the snp antic owe to her party antic be afraid her quest to take the moral high ground be stick at subterranean level but give that she

harassment they say that it depend on the context and whether the speech turn into actual genocidal conduct it be impossible to imagine call for mass murder of any other minority group be say to depend on the context call for the mass murder of black people or gay people would rightly not be tolerate for moment this be top level institutional jew hatred at the high level of academia and sadly university in the united kingdom be also infest with antisemitism do the leader of the house agree that british student must be protect from such poison completely agree with my right hon and learn

these academic institution to be the guardian of the value that we hold dear freedom of speech and freedom of thought be very important to academic inquiry and our democratic value but we can not in

week receive correspondence from and meet parent who be simply exasperate by the wait they face for child and adolescent mental health service assessment for their child for child to be educate

ask that her official and ministers get in touch with his office to see what can be do in the interim to bring that waiting time down and ensure that every child and young person be get the support they need may draw the leader of the house attention to the career of geraldine bradley the catering service manager at ballykeel primary school in county antrim in my constituency geraldine bradley have work there for year without single absentee day or sick day that be an absolutely incredible contribution to public service she cater currently for pupil in that school and have do so with excellence over the year she have feed and nourish thousand of pupil across the constituency how can well encourage other people in the public sector who engage in public service with such enthusiasm to look at the example that geraldine have set and apply it to their own career be sure we will all join the hon gentleman in send our thank congratulation and good wish to geraldine what an

article in the sunday times at the weekend be first hamas fighter rap she then they shoot she in the head in the light of the profoundly disturbing revelation in that article about sexual violence commit by hamas on october may we have ministerial statement so that the government can set out the action they will take to raise this issue in international forum such as the un some of which have be far too slow to recognise and condemn that aspect of the hamas atrocity thank my right hon friend for allow we to state on the record the appalling atrocity that many woman many of whom do not survive those attack have to endure at the hand of hamas include rape but also the most horrific torture and mutilation think we be all very disappointed that organisation to which we look to show leadership on these matter be not swifter and more robust in their condemnation of those appalling atrocity and act we spend great deal of time think about our own aid allocation in this respect and fund many scheme around the world that have have huge success in reduce violence against woman and girl will ensure that the minister with that responsibility in the foreign commonwealth and development office have hear what my right hon friend have say and we will reflect on what more we can do and what more we can say we expect from the organisation that we work with on these matter around the world since the russian invasion of ukraine the government have rightly make time in this chamber to debate that terrible conflict the israel gaza war be equally horrific from the killing of israelis on october to the death of thousand of palestinian civilian that continue daily no doubt the backbench business committee would look sympathetically on request for debate but should this not be debate in government time may we have day debate on it as soon as possible fully understand the hon gentleman request on his first point he will know that the foreign secretary have be in washington talk with our partner both about ukraine and the ongoing situation in israel and gaza will certainly ensure that both he and his minister in the commons my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell have hear the hon gentleman request our hard press and hard work police have have their leave cancel have be require to work overtime and be at break point just police organise protest to make it even bad the just stop oil brigade refuse to engage with the police about its protest the metropolitan police say that it have now cost taxpayer million to deal with those just stop oil protester so may we have an oral statement on police funding and what will be do to stop those protester bring london to halt join my hon friend in pay tribute to all the work that the police have do since we have give they some new power they have do an incredible job ensure that activist do not disrupt traffic or stop emergency vehicle and keep area run include our major motorway and in particular our capital city my hon friend be absolutely right that those protest be cost taxpayer and use police resource if he be to find campaign call just stop it just stop oil think it would be very well support will ensure that the home secretary have hear his concern about resource first may associate myself with the comment of the shadow leader of the house about alistair darling he be someone know he be huge figure in scottish politic and the perfect example of public servant also wish to pay tribute to lord james douglas hamilton the former conservative mp for edinburgh west who be always the perfect gentleman and another example to we all of public service constituent of mine recently raise the issue that he and number of other marine have be expose to asbestos during training exercise they be currently try to pursue an adequate response from the ministry of defence on this potential breach of health and safety can the government find time for we to discuss both this issue and the general issue of how we well protect our armed force on training exercise may associate myself with the remark of the hon lady about lord douglas hamilton be sure that all member would join she in that the hon lady raise very important matter know that in recent year the ministry of defence have be look at how it can mitigate thing that happen and injury cause on training exercise from its joint service publication to ensure that people have the right equipment and that it be all in good order the issue that she raise would be of most interest to the minister for veterans affairs will make sure that he have hear what she have say and think the topic would be an excellent one for an adjournment or westminster hall debate barrow and furness recently celebrate year of naval shipbuilding supply the submarine that keep we safe now and long into the future as the shipyard deliver dreadnought and now lean into the opportunity of aukus it remain pivotal to the uk and the world security give that position have join campaign to try to secure for barrow and furness the title of royal town the initiative be support by the lord lieutenant bae systems the local

my hon friend on his campaign which sound like very good initiative know that he be do whole raft of thing to put the town of barrow on the map he be right to say that this contribution provide security not just to the uk but to the world particularly because of the aukus agreement and our work with our five eyes partner he will know that royal title application be run through the cabinet office each decision be make on case by case basis would be very happy to meet he and give he any further information that he need as his campaign gather and generate support the government claim to be on the side of business mayphil industries global company with headquarters in merthyr tydfil have be try with my support to secure visa for essential training for senior executive from sri lanka

pen to paper this afternoon bbc funding with permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement on the bbc the bbc be great british institution and play vital role in our culture and creative economy it broadcast our value and identity all over the world reach hundred of million of people every day in january the government and bbc agree six year funding settlement which freeze the licence fee at for two year the two year freeze have already save every fee payer over and that settlement provide vital support for household when inflation be at its high while give the bbc the funding it need to deliver on its remit under the term of the settlement the licence fee must now increase annually in line with the consumer price index with the first increase due in april the government be commit to support family as much as possible during these difficult time we recognise that bill rise be never welcome and family budget remain under pressure today be announce that we will use the annual rate of cpi in september to calculate the increase of the bbc licence fee in april this be the same way the government calculate inflation link increase to state pension and benefit the decision mean next year licence fee increase will be keep as low as possible in april the licence fee will rise by to annually that will minimise the rise for household keep it to over the year or per month rather than rise of that would have happen under the previous cpi measure while we recognise that household budget remain under pressure the decision alongside the two year freeze will save individual licence fee payer over by the end of these intervention support household while provide the bbc with billion to produce its world lead content the government engage with both the bbc and to understand the impact on the finance of both broadcaster the decision will ensure that which be also fund from the licence fee can maintain its unique role in promote the welsh language and support our public service broadcasting landscape although we have take step to ensure that the uplift be keep as low as possible we recognise that increase will still be feel by licence fee payer the number of licence fee payer be also decline with an increasingly competitive medium landscape we need to make sure that the cost of the bbc do not rise exponentially and that it be not bear by small number of fee payer we be already see an increase number of household choose not to hold tv licence the number of household hold tv licence fall by last year and have decline by around million since that be place increase pressure on the bbc licence fee income we be also see rapidly change medium landscape with more way for audience to watch content the reach and view of broadcast tv fall significantly in with weekly reach fall from in to in as this trend continue link the tv licence to watch live tv will become increasingly anachronistic as audience viewing habit continue to move to digital and on demand medium we know that if we want the bbc to succeed we can not freeze its income but at the same time we can not ask household to pay more to support the bbc indefinitely we be already support the bbc to realise commercial opportunity that will make it more financially sustainable and will continue to explore they provisionally with the bbc the situation clearly show the need to consider the bbc funding arrangement to make sure they be fair for the public and sustainable for the bbc therefore be also announce that today the government be launch review of the bbc funding model the review will look at how we can ensure the funding model be fair for the public sustainable for the long term and support the bbc vital role in grow our creative industry the review will be lead by the department for culture media and sport and support by an expert panel it will assess range of option for fund the bbc we be clear that we want the bbc to succeed the review will include look at how the bbc can increase its commercial revenue to reduce the burden on licence fee payer give pressure on household income can explicitly rule out this review look at create any new taxis the finding of the review will support the government to make an informed choice on whether to consult the public on move to alternative funding model that would take place as part of the charter review process in which any final decision on reform the bbc funding model would be take the bbc be great national institution we want to ensure that it be fit for the present and whatever the future hold while keep cost down for the public that mean ensure that the bbc be support by funding model that be fair to audience support the creative industry and be sustainable in the age of digital and on demand medium commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state work people listen to the secretary of state pitiful comment on support with the cost of living be not fool they see exactly what this be we have have weak mealy mouthed platitude that will make no material difference to their life thirty three penny month per household be what understand to be the difference between today announcement and the deal the government have already agree to that be not nothing but do the secretary of state really think that it will even touch the side be she and the prime minister so out of touch that they think that will get people through the tory cost of living crisis they crash the economy send mortgage and rent sky high they hike taxis on work people they have preside over year of stagnant economic growth what be the cost of the government announcement the creative industry be one of the good source of economic growth and quality job in the country and the bbc be the big commissioner of work in the creative industry have the secretary of state work out the impact that choose that particular inflationary measure will have on economic growth and job have she work out the effect that it will have on the other creative business the bbc commission and their supply chain have she work out what difference it will make to the bbc crucial role as our soft power superpower promote brand britain around the world have she work out what the impact will be on democracy give the bbc role as the most trusted source of news anywhere in the world when it come to the funding model review understand that the term of reference be overtly focus on the commercial side of the bbc do not hear word about the public service element of the bbc the secretary of state mention an expert panel can she tell we who will be on it what timetable will it work to where will the public service element feature in the government term of reference have the government actually give up on the bbc as public service broadcaster be afraid to say that it all sound like yet more broken tory promise this be no way to treat one of our great institution and no way to treat the million of people who work at the bbc their partner and the people around the country who value they so much let we not forget that this come on the back of year freeze that have already have damaging impact this be just the late sign of chaotic decision making by flailing fail government lead by prime minister who be too weak to control his own party and by ministers who make work people pay for their mistake it be sign of the disdain that the tories have for the role that there have be secretary of state for dcms in year it top the reshuffle chart bring instability to department for economic growth our great institution our public service and work people just can not take any more of this chaos labour back the bbc we will grow our creative industry and spread the benefit across the country general election can not come moment too soon think the shadow secretary of state need to live in the real world like the rest of we people be struggle with the cost of living and the government have continue to take step to protect they she need to live in the real world in which the medium landscape be change it be totally inappropriate just to sit still and do nothing because that would destroy the bbc and make it unable to live in this change world and it would do nothing to protect licence fee payer if that be the labour plan do not want see it the shadow secretary of state talk about what we be do for work family she know that this be not the only step that we be take we have spend billion support family across the country save typical family about and cut inflation by half the hon lady mention the creative industry she might have forget that since have be in this role have use tax relief to support the creative industry the labour party vote against that in fact the conservative party have bring in tax relief for the creative industry year on year for year and they be vote down by the opposition on every single occasion labour do not support the creative industry the shadow secretary of state for education the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson say that we should be spend more money in school not on the creative industry but on other under this conservative government the creative industry be grow at double the rate of the rest of the economy and employ million people will happily update the shadow secretary of state for culture media and sport on other detail relate to the panel the timetable be that the report will come into play to by the autumn of call the father of the house at the risk of correct the hon member for bristol west thangam debbonaire think the housing minister have change more often than the secretary of state for culture media and sport say to my right hon and learn friend the secretary of state that do not think that anyone will go to the stake for the difference between the september cpi and other although we can note that be the bbc licence fee to go up by another it would still be week per household which be probably the good value in broadcasting anywhere be worried that the government have decide again to make decision without consult parliament if we be to have public broadcaster fund by licence fee or some equivalent parliament should be bring in more often by government this be probably the fourth time that there have be an announcement of what will happen without parliament have be consult first hope that my right hon and learn friend and other will say that parliament should be bring in if the choice be between the united states model and public broadcasting parliament ought to be able make its view know the house will have notice that the secretary of state say that the review will look at alternative option for fund the bbc and then say that she can rule out create any new taxis think that it be parliament that decide whether we have taxis the review may want to consider some kind of household payment whatever we call it at present it be call the licence fee if we do not call it tax we call it charge or something else or something to be take from exist taxation if the bbc be public benefit why not add to whatever household pay for the licence fee the imply tax on the income that they use to pay it for example that would allow the income from exist taxis to go up the bbc need defender and be one of they as long as be here the government can expect detailed attention and great deal of support for do sensible thing too be defender of the bbc it provide an outstanding service across the world be proud to have see at first hand the fantastic job that it do for eurovision for the coronation and for the last night of the proms if we be to create something that spread our value and soft power abroad we could not do well than create the bbc certainly do not want to see its service diminish but want to ensure that it continue to survive in this change medium world at the moment it be lose audience and licence fee payer and want to help to support it that be one thing that we will look at carefully in the review the father of the house rightly mention the importance of discussion and consultation my door be open to all those who want to raise point with of course in due course we will need to consult and this be part of the charter review which will involve wide consultation exercise call the scottish national party spokesperson the conservatives agree to increase the licence fee in line with inflation but their own economic mismanagement mean more misery for uk citizen the government be now desperately try to wriggle on how they calculate inflation for the purpose of this agreement there be pattern among those on the government benches that they will breach an agreement convention or protocol whenever it suit they let the conservatives take responsibility for this bbc uplift as the need for the rise be entirely due to their mismanagement of the economy we all have some criticism of the bbc sometimes they be centre on its domestic news coverage but the bbc go far beyond that extend to drama radio documentary gaelic broadcasting and sport coverage to those who would ding doon the public service broadcaster say be very careful what you wish for of course for many tories the ideal would be gb news hour day with tory mps talk to tory mps about tory policy believe it be know as gbeebies as one tory mp after another be wheel in to rant culture war tosh at the camera in pale imitation of american shock jock it be breach of ofcom rule democracy need tough journalism and mps scrutinise in long format interview by objective journalist we have see what the cut lead to the bbc agree most foolishly to take responsibility for licence under the previous director general tony hall that have lead to cut in news most recently at newsnight which be once proud to serve as reporter the bbc oppose the government renege on their agreement on that at the time and we have see the result in the year to come the bbc may need different funding format but that time be not now in closing may ask the secretary of state on behalf of my colleague on the select committee to explain why the news of the new bbc chair be leak to the press rather than be give directly to committee member or the committee chair be grateful for the hon gentleman point he mention many important part of the bbc and other outlet be in favour of plurality of the medium so that we get wide variety of voice of course the preferred candidate as chair be announce and they will be go before his committee in due course one important aspect of public service broadcasting be regional news we have already experience cut to bbc local radio but regional news programme such as the lincolnshire and yorkshire edition of look north which serve my constituency be greatly value by my constituent will my right hon and learn friend give an assurance that the bbc will continue with the current level of regional news broadcast the bbc be of course operationally independent and it be not for the government to say what it should provide however remind my hon friend and the house that the bbc be there to provide public service and it have public purpose to reflect represent and serve the diverse community of all of the uk the bbc must also support the creative economy across the uk of course regional and local news and other output be an important part of that may ask the secretary of state to get real be secretary of the national union of journalists parliamentary group and it have other member here she know that as sure as night follow day there will be the loss of journalistic job as result of this cut at key time when we be go into general election and they be desperately need why do she not admit that this be revenge attack for all those time at past on the bbc today programme when ministers have be ask question by nick robinson mishal husain justin webb amol rajan or martha kearney have flounder to answer basic straight question the review be an overlying threat to the bbc about its behaviour in hold this government to account do not accept anything that the right hon gentleman have just say the purpose of the review be to ensure that the bbc can continue to provide its exceptional and outstanding service for decade to come if we just sit on our hand and do nothing it will be overtake by other medium outlet that be compete in the world we need to ensure that the bbc have sustainable financial platform from which to provide its outstanding service have always love the bbc as kid grow up and since have be blow away by the quality of its broadcasting by its sport music culture radio nature news and of course humour even though feel we have lose something with this endless thirst for political correctness however have be increasingly concerned in recent month by the political bias creep in notably with individual commentary from presenter through tweet and with inaccuracy in report the bbc be public service broadcaster it be not political organisation so do the secretary of state agree that the bbc have much more to do here to fully justify its publicly fund licence fee the heart of my hon friend question be about the bbc impartiality know that the bbc strive hard to maintain impartiality with its point plan but at its heart the bbc need to provide an impartial service because if it do not do so it should not be get licence fee payer money and it be just the same as every other organisation that be why it need to continue to strive as know it do to ensure that it provide impartial output we should put on the record how lucky we be to have this public service broadcaster we have just have statement from the foreign commonwealth and development office about russian interference in our democracy where this house raise its concern ahead of the possible election which will perhaps come soon rather than later how do the secretary of state think that do this and cut the bbc budget by million be go to help resilience in the whole of society in an election year when we know that misinformation and disinformation by malign state have never be more of threat wish to correct the hon lady we be not cut the bbc budget but increase it by what we be not do be increase it by she will know from speak to company or household in her constituency whether those company have have increase in their funding have the government have increase in their funding we be create careful balance to ensure that we support the bbc with this rise of to provide those service while think carefully about the cost of living and bill for household up and down the country thank my right hon and learn friend for her statement on restrict the increase in the bbc licence fee also recognise the reassurance she have give which be face particularly challenging time and need stability as she say the licence fee still raise billion department local authority and most public organisation have to publish detail and invoice in respect of sum in excess of have try on two occasion in the house to introduce legislation to force the bbc to do the same within the review will she consider how we can increase transparency and scrutiny of the billion that be spend so that we can introduce well efficiency gain and scrutinise closely where money might be waste my right hon friend make an interesting point do not think it will form part of this review but it be an interesting point that will reflect on and consider far wish to declare that too be an officer of the nuj parliamentary group in fact be its co chair may point out to the minister the damaging impact of dramatic cut already be implement by the bbc management include to the value bbc local radio service which we have discuss in this house on several occasion to highly regard investigative journalist job most notably and recently on newsnight and to local news output give that inflation have be substantially high than expect during the two year licence fee freeze and give as my hon friend the member for bristol west thangam debbonaire say from the front bench that the bbc be the big commissioner of the creative industry in the uk will the minister in her review of the funding model please ensure that the bbc have enough funding to maintain the high quality in commission production and broadcasting be absolutely committed to ensure that our creative industry continue to thrive and have set very high ambition in that space as have say want to see the creative industry grow by billion and have million extra job by we be already see that growth with the creative industry grow at twice the rate of the rest of the economy have help ensure that the creative industry get tax relief in june they have further funding of million which will leverage further private investment there be an announcement in the recent autumn statement about further support for visual effect through the tax system be absolutely back the creative industry want they to thrive and we be put in place mechanism to ensure that they survive the bbc be part of that and be one of the thing that will take into account welcome the statement from my right hon and learn friend what further step be she take to encourage the bbc to maximise its commercial revenue in order to minimise the burden on licence fee payer my hon friend make an important point want to see thriving bbc that can compete internationally and be get further income there be lot of opportunity for the bbc to explore and want to work with it very closely on those and understand they in great deal whether that mean international work and international charging or partnership and joint venue want to make sure that the bbc have every opportunity to maximise its commercial income have always be staunch defender of the bbc not least because my late parent meet when they both work for the corporation so would not be here otherwise however the increase challenge for news coverage and the bias that have creep in have be of concern to my constituent write to the director general follow the broadcasting of hamas propaganda on the attack on the gaza hospital that be leave up on the bbc website literally all day create community tension in my constituency there be not word of apology not retraction and not even reply from the director general as we approach this review can we make sure that build into it be the requirement for absolute impartiality and fact checking of news before it be post my hon friend make really important point because the bbc be so respected throughout the world and because it have reputation for provide impartial and accurate news when it get it wrong in this case it do get it wrong and it have admit now that it do the impact of that be more significant than when any other news outlet get it wrong particularly on issue such as the one that my hon friend mention where there be consequence of inaccurate reporting both in the region and here include for the jewish community at home and the antisemitism that result from that it be so important that the bbc take time to reflect and make sure that when it put its news out it be accurate thank the secretary of state for her statement and for provide clarity be sure that she be well aware of my feeling about bbc reporting which seem to be drive to certain leaning and by an agenda that have issue with other have mention that as well however some of the programming be target at small and specific audience such as the ulster scots be very proud to be an ulster scot and seek more ulster scots programme on the bbc regionally or the heritage programme which be always beautifully do how will the secretary of state ensure that the tightening that be do relate to pay presenter exorbitant wage as oppose to cut the niche programming that be necessary for the preservation of culture and heritage which love thank the hon member for his important question must emphasise that the bbc be operationally independent it have duty to provide diverse news and cultural programme that be particular and relevant to the region and it must fulfil that duty under the term of the charter and its public service mission the decision about who the bbc employ and what it pay be matter for it but it have obligation relate to transparency welcome the secretary of state statement and particularly the review of whether the bbc be be fair to taxpayer have to say constituent in southend and leigh on sea do not consider that they get value for money from the licence fee and nor do they think that billion be good amount for the licence fee many have write to to express profound concern about the bbc coverage of the horrendous conflict between israel and hamas this be about not just the bbc failure to talk about hamas as an internationally proscribe terrorist organisation but their genuine belief that bbc bias be stoke anti israel sentiment in our country which as be sure the secretary of state will agree be very concerning so will the review cover three point as well as all the other first the impartiality of content secondly whether the licence fee should be mandatory any long and thirdly the need to decriminalise non payment of the licence fee understand my hon friend concern about the language that the bbc have choose to use in relation to hamas have make clear my view they be public on this issue and have state on the record and raise with the bbc privately that hamas be terrorist organisation both legally and factually and that it be important to call they what they be as for her constituent concern all of we of course get comment from our constituent and that be an excellent avenue for people to pursue however remind her constituent and other that there be also formal channel through which they can make their view know if they feel strongly that they should pursue those matter we be look at impartiality in the mid term review which we will publish shortly like she be also concerned about the prosecution of people and have say that will look at that in the charter review welcome the announcement of the funding model review it be the responsible thing to do give the change medium landscape that my right hon and learn friend mention however my constituent will raise an eyebrow at the bbc price go up this year to deliver less with the bbc have close the oxford newsroom and make severe cut to three counties radio will she lock into the review mechanism so that if the licence fee be to remain compulsory for those wish to have television there have to be consumer test to properly monitor what viewer actually want to watch and listen to as always my hon friend make some interesting point as we look at the licence fee review and the funding review it be really important that we consider all aspect very carefully the bbc be there to provide great service to the public and that be what the public expect bill presented safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill presentation and first reading standing order no secretary james cleverly support by the prime minister the chancellor of the exchequer secretary oliver dowden and michael tomlinson present bill to make provision about the removal of certain migrant to the republic of rwanda bill read the first time to be read second time on monday december and to be print bill with explanatory note bill en backbench business tackle islamophobia beg to move that this house have consider the matter of tackle islamophobia thank the backbench business committee for agree to this general debate on tackle islamophobia also thank the all party parliamentary group on british muslims and particularly its co chair my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen and the hon member for peterborough paul bristow for their continue work to push this debate and for their ongoing effort to tackle islamophobia it must be note however that member of this house have over several year repeatedly request that government time be grant to debate such pertinent issue but those call have fall on deaf ear the minister will no doubt tell we that the government take this issue seriously oh the gaslighting assure all those listen to this debate who might not really understand the issue that when muslim community speak up on the issue of islamophobia we be not look for preferential treatment in fact quite the opposite we be ask for equal treatment free of discrimination injustice and hatred in the us the biden administration have form an inter agency working group to counter rise level of islamophobia in canada prime minister justin trudeau have appoint the first ever special representative on combat islamophobia to advise the federal government the united nations designate march as the international day to combat islamophobia follow the general assembly acceptance of resolution propose by the muslim member state of the organisation of islamic cooperation and yet despite all this despite the us canada the un muslim nation around the world and almost every mainstream muslim organisation in the uk and muslims more generally define the experience as islamophobic our government refuse even to call it islamophobia internationally government be stand up to this dangerous insidious threat to our community but here in the uk this government be shamefully still play with semantic accord to the late statistic there have be rise in islamophobic incident here in the uk include both verbal and physical abuse as well as vandalism such as the dumping of pig head at propose mosque in the market town of barnoldswick that be not all that be happen when it come to islamophobia the recorded incident be just snapshot of picture that be much ugly than any stat can paint make no mistake islamophobia be an entire industry the reality be that islamophobia have become an acceptable prejudice in fact you can openly spout islamophobia and nobody neither politician nor journalist will even bat an eyelid sadly almost no one will speak up or challenge it in fact you can be former adviser to prime minister and the current conservative parliamentary candidate for west suffolk and advocate for special law just to deal with muslims include create register of imam and mosque close down mosque muslim charity and muslim tv station and ban the burqa and the hijab in school you can call for whole legal structure to deal with those muslims as if they be specific problem and guess what you can continue to be conservative party member and prospective parliamentary candidate without any consequence you can suggest that muslim culture be inherently in the grip of death cult that sacralise bloodshed and week later without any apology be invite on to platform such as question time as key guest you can also say that muslims be not like we and be nation within nation sow the seed of division and hate without ever retract those statement never mind apologise for the hurt they have cause to community and guess what you can get regular slot as presenter on mainstream news channel you can even be an open islamophobe like douglas murray who call for condition for muslims in europe to be make hard across the board and be platforme by the daily telegraph and the jewish chronicle and wait for this one even be defend at the dispatch box by the then home secretary on the one hand under the banner of free speech you can say pretty much anything about muslims and islam and still occupy mainstream space on the other hand when thousand of people use their democratic right to protest and raise their voice to call for fire in gaza and to support the palestinian cause they be label as hate marcher and terrorist sympathiser even the prime minister join the former home secretary in aid that dog whistle politic this be no surprise to british muslims because we all know that this government have make islamophobia the central piece in their manufacture culture war to deflect from their incompetence and their failure to govern this nation as the saying go the proof be in the pudding only in the last hour we have hear the shocking revelation from the hon member for gillingham and rainham rehman chishti who be former minister and former vice chair of the conservative party that the pm have write off engagement with muslim community and do not take islamophobia as seriously as other form of racism he have go far by say that the prime minister be pay lip service to tackle hatred against muslims despite everything that british muslims be face can not remember the last time prime minister or home secretary visit mosque to show gesture of support to british muslim community the failure to support british muslim community at time when they be worried about attack and at time when the government own hate crime reporting centre have see rise in attack show that the problem go right to the heart of government not only labour mp be say that conservative mp be concern too the hypocrisy and the disparity in behaviour from the government stink british muslim community want level playing field so that they be equally part of modern britain of build our economy build our nhs build our business and entrepreneurship and build britain to be the good nation in the world british muslims know and understand that if britain succeed they and their family succeed want people across society to understand that when all community include british muslims succeed britain succeed we all succeed the success we should have be hinder by the racism face by muslim community across britain today nobody be ask for exceptional treatment they be simply ask for parity if the government can allow other community to define the prejudice and hatred that impact they why can they not allow british muslim community to define islamophobia if the government can engage with mainstream organisation from other community why do they pursue policy of non engagement with mainstream muslim organisation such as the muslim council of britain if at time when antisemitism be on sharp rise the chancellor can rightfully announce an extra million of funding in the autumn statement to tackle it why at time when islamophobia be also rise do he refuse to announce single penny of extra support for british muslim community in the same statement if the government can have work independent adviser on antisemitism why three and half year after the announcement of an independent adviser on islamophobia have they be unable to appoint one or to take the role forward hope the minister be make note because expect response to every single one of these disparity where come from you can not be bit pregnant you be either pregnant or you be not you be either on the side of equality or you be not in the same vein you either stand up for human right or you do not the problem for this government be that they choose when they want to be pregnant they never actually see the pregnancy through to full term which be why they have never give birth to serious policy let alone nurture policy to drive change that help britain to reach its full potential as country madam deputy speaker if you will allow to indulge my curiosity be eager to know four year after announce an adviser announce work definition of islamophobia and announce that they take anti muslim hatred so seriously what progress the government have actually make in respond to the urgency they insist upon moreover what do the minister understand islamophobia to be would be happy to give way to she if she would like to explain that deafen silence allow islamophobia in all its pernicious form to thrive accord to home office statistic hate crime target muslims rise by last year make muslims the most targeted religious group almost half of religiously motivate attack be against muslims trend that have stay consistent for the last six year every year these statistic be release and every year there be zero action take by the government what be bad be refuse to call out islamophobia stick to the term anti muslim hatred recognise the consequence once an attack assault or physical or verbal abuse have take place but it deny islamophobia so nothing be ever do to treat the cause instead we respond only to the symptom this mean that we recognise the murder of year old mushin ahmed from rotherham but we do nothing to challenge the radicalisation that influence his killer who call he groomer stamp on his head and beat that innocent grandfather to death as he return from his early morning prayer it mean that on the one hand we call out his murder and that on the other hand we allow mainstream voice include those of many in this house and some who be previously in government to perpetuate far right conspiracy about muslim grooming gang contradict evidence from the home office own inquiry people do not just wake up and decide to commit act of terror against muslims they do not just attack mosque one day to commit criminal damage they do not just randomly pull someone hijab or whack hijab wear muslim woman over the head because they be violent people they do these thing because they be radicalise by islamophobic conspiracy that go unchallenged in the same manner this issue be not just about hate it be about the prejudice and racism face by british muslims newspaper investigation have show that if someone simply change their name to mohammed from john smith while keep all the other detail the same their car insurance could cost they another other research have show that cv with muslim sound name be three time less likely to result in an interview we see the same disparity across the board in healthcare business and society these act of prejudice and clearcut racism be not necessarily act of hate but the unwillingness to accept islamophobia and the willingness to accept only anti muslim hate mean that no one be able to understand those disparity or to challenge that injustice how can we define something we do not even understand that be why member of the muslim community be not surprise by the alarming rise of islamophobia and anti muslim hate crime they see the everyday micro aggression throughout society they see how people can say thing on the medium about muslims and how they can fuel hatred against they in way that no one would accept with any other community but still maintain the cloak of respectability in mainstream space many people now fear for their child future in britain and those who can afford to do so be leave some of the bright most intelligent mind include our good doctor engineer banker and trader who can help to rebuild britain transform our economy and support our nhs and who love britain and be british be look to resettle due to fear of what will happen as thing get bad that be why say to the government that muslim community be not ask for special treatment they simply see the government own record statistic on attack against muslims rise each year they see their government inaction and unwillingness to take control they see on the one hand how thing be become bad and on the other hand how they be be patronise and gaslit by government who will not even call islamophobia what it be the government inaction have directly or indirectly allow islamophobia to become institutionalised embed and even normalise across society in china there be uyghur muslims in concentration camp be force to eat pork and drink alcohol while muslim woman be be force to marry non muslim man in myanmar we have see the genocidal campaign to wipe out rohingya muslim community with more than kill and almost million refugee flee to cox bazar in modi india with extremist group such as the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh we see an environment ripe for pogrom against muslims at this moment we be witness collective punishment be endure by the people of gaza with the horror of srebrenica in live memory the road map of inaction and grow far right narrative it be all too clear to muslim community where we could be head my warning to the government be that if we do not act now muslims in this country might also face christchurch style terrorist attack the recent election of geert wilders in the netherlands should worry we fringe extreme view enter the mainstream when they be leave unchecked we can tackle this rise tide of hate only when good people speak up when we become upstander and not bystander and when we agree and openly believe that muslims also matter if government such as mine can call out the treatment of uyghur muslims in china and can implement sanction how can they be so silent or offer only empty word when international law be brazenly and openly ignore by an ally nation true justice take brave conversation because it mean speak truth to power whether it be to friend or anybody else for that reason recently accompany my local dean andy bowerman from bradford cathedral on visit to jaranwala in pakistan with islamic relief muslim charity for which be an ambassador meet christian community and provide they with aid and support follow the religious persecution they have face as muslim of pakistan kashmiri heritage feel it be my duty to support these minority community face persecution among the many story hear the one that strike the most be about how their muslim neighbour stand between they and their attacker as their life be put in danger an act of bravery courage and solidarity mention that because people do not expect everyone to fix their problem but one thing that do give they hope in the darkest of day be the real sense of solidarity they receive from other who stand with they let we stand together and challenge all injustice equally my ask to the minister be simple will she today announce any new solution and policy that the government will act on to help tackle islamophobia the debate on the appg definition of islamophobia be over islamophobia have be define that boat sail five year ago when will the minister and the government adopt the definition three and half year ago at the same time as they announce an adviser on antisemitism the government announce an adviser on islamophobia three and half year later there be rightly still an adviser on semitism so why be the government not take seriously and recruit somebody for the role of islamophobia adviser give the rise level of islamophobia across society this be much like what we see with the announcement in the autumn statement what new funding will the minister announce to enable we to tackle deep root islamophobia there be good colleague here on both side of the chamber and from all party call out islamophobia and the government failure if the minister do not provide answer and solution today but prefer to use her time at the dispatch box to far gaslight british muslim community that will once again signal to they that the government will do nothing to challenge the islamophobia they face and will signal to wide society that there be hierarchy in racism although inaction may mean nothing to the government the danger of not act would sadly be feel by british muslims take no decision be also decision before start my remark direct member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interest also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for hyndburn sara britcliffe who be suppose to co sponsor the debate we work closely together on this issue and pay tribute to she and her constituent she have large and vibrant muslim community community she care deeply about as in many constituency up and down the country community in hyndburn be particularly concerned about the impact of the conflict in gaza which have see rise in islamophobia but which be above all take an awful toll on innocent civilian know that my hon friend be make and will continue to make every effort to represent her constituent on that issue at this challenging time last month be islamophobia awareness month speak to an audience at an event organise in my constituency by the joint mosques council and pay tribute to abdul choudhuri its chair for put on that event also pay tribute to the muslim council of peterborough which be chair by mohammad ayub choudry at that event tell story which will tell again in the summer of in the run up to the by election where come stunning third be knock on door and knock on the door of gentleman call amir suleman he say to paul want to know your view on the all party parliamentary group definition of islamophobia look at he rather blankly do not know what to say do not have much to say at all vaguely know that the issue be be discuss but have no in depth knowledge about it and feel ashamed be seek to represent thousand and thousand of muslim constituent and know nothing about the appg definition that he have contribute to and that matter so much to many member of the community and to the constituent seek to represent what do do about it promise amir there and then that would further my knowledge and become involved in the appg should win the election follow two or three rather embarrassing interview on salaam radio and have become the member of parliament for peterborough be proud to stand with the hon member for luton north sarah owen as the co chairman of the all party parliamentary group on british muslims amir suleman challenge and he be right to do so he be my friend and be proud to represent he as we hear from the hon member for bradford west naz shah the appg definition be solid and sound and the government should adopt it they do decide to produce their own working definition but they be still without an adviser to replace the one who sadly be remove from that position and they seem to have get themselves into difficult situation they do not seem to know what to do about this and hope the minister will tell what she be go to do about it but let suggest solution they should adopt the appg definition which they could have do many year ago we do not have to go through this any more the appg definition have be adopt by many different people and organisation and if the government adopt it their problem would be solve instantly however do not want to talk only about negative aspect of the muslim community want to talk about some positive aspect because peterborough would not be peterborough without that community be proud of some of the appg report since have be involve in it because they show not just the challenge face by muslims but the contribution that their community make to this country be proud of the fact that muslims contribute billion to the uk economy and anyone who visit peterborough will find the sign of that be not hard to see some of the wealthy people in peterborough be muslims they be entrepreneur they set up business and they have do fantastically well in contribute to peterborough economy when it come to charitable giving and go the extra mile the muslim community do that in spade do not know for certain but would bet dinner at one of the top restaurant in peterborough that the time when the large amount be raise for charity in my city be ramadan million of pound be raise and go to good cause that be just one example of the contribution that muslims make not just in peterborough but throughout the country one of the appg report faith as the fourth emergency service draw attention to that charitable contribution to good cause in the uk the contribution of this community have never be see more clearly than during the covid pandemic we have many different community in peterborough and many different faith we believe different thing we speak different language and we come from different part of the world however when it come to support one another and support the vulnerable we in peterborough come together as one city that show what contribution muslim community and other can make when the country be face an emergency many member include the hon member for bradford west today have talk about the challenge that muslims have face insidious and often silent form of islamophobia involve for instance car insurance and be ask to pay more for service see this all the time in peterborough friend of mine muslim conservative councillor often change his name to an english sound one when try to buy house in order to get foot in the door but when he go to view the house he be tell actually it have already be sell that have happen to he on number of occasion and it be an example of everyday islamophobia we can not turn blind eye to it we must call it out when we see it and we see it all too often in preparation for the debate ask my constituent through my facebook page whose follower be strong to tell about their experience of islamophobia let read out few of their response the first be from kaoru miyake who write islamophobia come from ignorance stereo type and fear of unknown ordinary muslims have no connection to hamas isis or other terrorist group all too often she suggest it be assume that they do have such connection and fear that she be right suzette weston who obviously be not muslim write it be easy for ignorant people to call all muslims terrorist than to take the time to understand vast majority be just love family people entirely agree with she ahmed another constituent write there must be strong campaign to unite and educate the public on the issue of islamophobia and anti semitism and how the conflict we be see today arise from ignorance could not have put it well myself these be ordinary people and often find that if ask ordinary people in my constituency for their view they respond in their drove with common sense observation let for moment talk in my capacity as conservative mp when campaign in my constituency when knock on door and speak to constituent find that the value of muslims be value that share as conservative they be entrepreneur they believe in low tax in family value and in strong community if we be able to talk about international issue in an empathetic and understanding way if we be able to understand what the death or persecution of muslim mean anywhere in the world whether it happen next door or in kashmir gaza or myanmar we could lead the muslim community in this country if we could do that my party would probably receive many more vote from community that have sometimes be see shamelessly as vote bank for the labour party if we be able to get our language right we would reap the reward have talk about international situation now want to talk briefly about the ongoing conflict in gaza we have see an increase in antisemitism obviously but also an increase in islamophobia as result of that conflict the revulsion that ordinary muslims in place such as peterborough feel about the death of innocent people in gaza and about the people who be suffer collective punishment for the crime of hamas people who have do nothing wrong but be see their home be destroy and bomb land on their home and in their community can not be overstate thousand undoubtedly have die and many building have be destroy struggle to understand how any of this make israel any safe we need permanent ceasefire in gaza write to the prime minister about this some time ago and my feeling be exactly the same now we give peace chance when we have temporary truce more than hostage be release and the bombing stop we need to give peace chance permanently be grateful to the all party parliamentary group for british muslims for remind before the debate that mine be the constituency with the large number of muslims they constitute about of the population there about people to put that in context the muslim population in my constituency be itself hugely diverse and have community from africa asia the middle east and indeed from europe that be within constituency where almost half the total population be bear outside the uk it be very liberal and very tolerant constituency and have always be extremely proud to represent it and to live there in the heart of the community unfortunately however even in normal time there be significant number of hate crime be shocked that nationally of all hate crime be commit against muslims be shocked that of mosque have experience some form of attack over the last three year we have have incident where woman go about their ordinary business have have their headscarf pull off and be abuse there be great deal of what one might call casual though by no mean trivial racism where in the context of the neighbourly dispute that we all deal with as mp people religion be bring up often from position of entire ignorance be strike by the fact that quite lot of non muslims be also subject to islamophobic abuse presumably on the ground of their ethnicity complacency be the enemy here we need to educate people as much as we can but we also need to punish people and be sure that all hon member present be work with their local police on tackle islamophobia and hate crime it be also the case that muslim community who often be disproportionately in poor housing suffer from poverty and other form of injustice and live in overcrowded and damp condition be neglect and do not get their fair share of resource one particular type of discrimination be the lack of prayer space and community space for many muslim community the mosque be not just place of prayer and worship but an educational social and cultural hub particularly in area such as london where land and property be hugely expensive that be make very difficult we live in straiten time but through the lottery and other money there be potential to provide that however increasingly see muslim community not have the resource that they should have and be discriminate against in that way if that be the position in normal time unfortunately the time we live in be bad than that because of the international situation will not go into detail because the matter will be subject to the court in due course but an individual be arrest about day ago for series of attack over period of month or so on mosque and muslim own business in west london have visit the major local mosque in my constituency in white city and shepherd bush and be pleased to say that they have not be victim but acton mosque and other mosque in the area have suffer repeat and regular attack to their premise in addition this be of particular concern to the palestinian mission be attack on number of occasion death threat be issue and there be attack on property own by the mission staff be very proud to have the palestinian mission in hammersmith but there be an irony here that because of the failure to recognise palestine as state the mission lack diplomatic status everybody refer to dr husam zomlot whom many of we know as the fantastic representative of palestine in the uk as the ambassador and to the mission as the embassy but it have be bring home to very significantly that that be not the case have write several time to the commander responsible for diplomatic protection ask that diplomatic protection be grant to the mission particularly at this difficult time and particularly when it have suffer series not one but series of criminal damage attack have not have response to those letter know that my right hon friend the shadow home secretary and the shadow foreign secretary have also write to their counterpart raise those concern so they have be raise at the most senior level it be frankly outrageous when tension be run so high and when any embassy of any other country would receive full diplomatic protection that that be not be grant the palestinian mission represent all palestinians irrespective of religion but there be undoubtedly an islamophobic element in the flavour of the attack that have take place have say that the enemy here be complacency we must take islamophobia seriously we must at all time be aware that its impact on our community be significant in people everyday life that be equally true of semitism and other form of hatred base on race religion and other protect characteristic it be an insidious and grow part of our society but it be disproportionately affect muslim community even in the most liberal and tolerant part of our community that be feature that we must resist hope that the minister respond to this debate not just with warm word but with action funding and real determination to take islamophobia seriously because it be constant and ever present threat within many of our community order be not go to put time limit on speech but look at the clock and give that colleague wish to speak in addition to the front benchers think it would be helpful and courtesy to other if speech be confine to around eight minute bear in mind that there be another debate to follow this one it be real pleasure to speak in this debate refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests speak in this debate from number of different perspective but before commence want to pay tribute to the backbench business committee for allow this debate to take place from to be the united kingdom prime minister special envoy for international freedom of religion or belief for all advocate and engage with people from all across parliament in an inclusive manner to ensure that the uk stand by and stand up for international freedom of religion or belief for all that mean take forward the bishop of truro report as top priority for the foreign office and the prime minister at that time that report mean the uk ensure that we stand up for international freedom of religion and belief for all faith during my time in office work with the united states we set up member international alliance of state work together to advance international freedom of religion or belief for all we then sign off on the uk host an international summit on international freedom of religion or belief during we see the real challenge of people around the world be target for their faith or belief there be real increase in antisemitism in islamophobia and in anti christian hatred and we see that across the board refer to that in the westminster hall debate when step down from that role in have advocate as former uk special envoy for international freedom of religion or belief all around the world be top priority of the united kingdom government for other country around the world do the right thing and for ensure that people be treat fairly and equally then have to ask myself what the situation be in the uk regard intolerance and hatred towards faith community across the board this debate be about islamophobia which some term anti muslim hatred tell mama an organisation fund by the government say that its late figure demonstrate sevenfold increase in incident of anti muslim hatred and islamophobia accord to independent home office figure on the faith community that receive the large amount of hate in of incident be against the muslim community and be against the jewish community in of incident be against the muslim community and be against the jewish community in of incident of faith base hate and intolerance be against the muslim community and be against the jewish community year after year those two faith community have experience the large amount of hate and intolerance that be unacceptable accord to the community security trust intolerance hatred and antisemitism against the jewish community be exceptionally high that be unacceptable policymaker and government must act to challenge intolerance and hate against all faith community in fair and inclusive manner that be why at prime minister question last week ask the prime minister about the unacceptable rise in intolerance and hate against two faith community in the autumn statement the government announce million in funding to tackle antisemitism and they be absolutely right to do that they also provide million in october after the horrific barbaric terrorist act in israel carry out by the terrorist organisation hamas the impact of that on antisemitism in the uk be shocking and the government response be right and proper hope the minister can answer my question because the prime minister have not nor have he speak to since raise it with he why be there no funding to tackle anti muslim hatred in the autumn statement speak to the prime minister in his office during the leadership contest about engage with the muslim community in an inclusive manner across the board know the different challenge he say that he be committed to that and that we would work together on it be wait to see the prime minister to this day have be foreign commonwealth and development office minister an envoy and an mp when give my word honour it if someone can not honour their word they should not give it in any area of life the hon member for bradford west naz shah raise an interesting point about the question ask the prime minister why do the government not have an independent adviser on islamophobia why have that role be leave vacant for more than year guardian article that have here report that in one of her last act as prime minister my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may appoint john mann to the government post of independent adviser on antisemitism as former british envoy for religious freedom work with he in the other place he do terrific job my right hon friend also appoint qari asim as the independent adviser on islamophobia he be in office for one year he tell that he be never give any term of reference by the department for levelling up housing and communities he be remove from office in and there have be no action to appoint another independent adviser pay tribute to our former adviser on islamophobia have here document that read faith leader write prayer for holocaust memorial day the faith leader be his grace the archbishop of canterbury the chief rabbi and imam qari asim he be good enough to write that prayer and to work with faith leader and we must acknowledge his work there may have be difference in policy with the government but an independent adviser should advise independently the hon member be make an interesting point do he accept that the yardstick apply to thing that muslims say be different islamophobia have become an acceptable respectable form of racism across society and it have be embolden by people who do not challenge it be it not true that qari asim be measure with different yardstick qari asim work with the archbishop of canterbury the chief rabbi and all faith leader and he do terrific job in that regard when we be deal with independent adviser we must respect their advice they look at thing from faith perspective and they may sometimes express disagreement but that be the role of an independent adviser when the government want to remove someone from office there be something call courtesy and decency have here the letter sack qari asim and it be not even sign by minister it just say you no long require because your view be not compliant with freedom of expression think the whole thing about freedom of expression and respect be difference of opinion freedom of expression mean that people can engage in peaceful protest when they do not agree with certain course of action the government need to look at that carefully ask the minister to answer the question that the prime minister do not why have the government not appoint an independent adviser on islamophobia will they appoint one so that we have parity with the independent adviser on antisemitism when will that decision be make the hon member be make an excellent speech on this important subject he speak about qari asim an excellent imam whom know should our conclusion not be that the government never have any intention of do anything with he have be member of parliament for year and resign from government when asia bibi christian mother of five be not give sanctuary in the uk as she should have be our government do not offer it be the british trade envoy to pakistan and advocate for justice for she there which she get but she need country to step up and take she in canada do we do not and resign from the government because we do not do the right thing come from muslim background my father and grandfather be imam it be the right thing to do to stand up for someone be persecute the hon member for manchester gorton afzal khan ask whether the government really intend for qari asim to do some work for year have try to engage with the government and with the prime minister and the cabinet who make the decision the prime minister say that it be about action not word he need to explain why action have not be take otherwise people may infer as the hon member say that the prime minister be not genuinely engage on this matter nor do he want to engage because what he say be not follow by substance if the government be commit to engage with the independent adviser qari asim why do they not give he term of reference for two year pay tribute to his work and to that of john mann in the other place who do terrific job on antisemitism ours be great country because we have people from all faith and background come together to make it so and contribute at every level my hon friend the member for peterborough paul bristow do fantastic job champion his constituent and engage with the muslim community he highlight their economic contribution of more than billion to our way of life be that right yes thank my hon friend for clarify that point we have people like mo ali in cricket across the board in enterprise and sport muslims contribute at every level our population in the uk be around million or of the total population have strong cohesive society be not just morally right it be in our national security interest when we have government favour one faith community and not another it lead to division and divisiveness which we do not want the minister may want to look at the prime minister twitter page which list an eid event on may and an engagement on eid mubarak with the muslim community there be nothing else on the prime minister page about tackle anti muslim hatred but there be mention of tackle antisemitism even though antisemitism and islamophobia be both unacceptable if someone look at the government action from the outside they will see that there be no independent adviser for anti muslim hatred and no comparable funding to tackle it which create negative perception of the prime minister and his ministers in the autumn statement the treasury give million to deal with antisemitism do the department for levelling up housing and communities ask for money from the treasury to deal with anti muslim hatred if the department do not ask for money do not think we can not blame the chancellor so the department have to answer the question have another question for the minister and hope the prime minister will read it in hansard the prime minister say that the government have give tell mama million since its inception in to deal with anti muslim hatred we have see the stat that show that such incident be increase and increase the minister may say that the government funding be for protect place of worship think that be the answer give by the treasury in the home office statistic there be category for protect place of worship which cover mosque temple gurdwara and other across the board but there be no datum on how much money have be give the government say up to amount be available okay but how much of it have actually be give will end with this as former foreign office minister can tell the house that people across the world look around and say the uk advocate for international freedom of religion or belief for get lot do during my time in office work with the us on get member of the community release from the houthis in yemen and help people in uzbekistan who have be persecute for their how do you address anti muslim hatred in the uk with the resource and structure that you use to deal with other form of hatred think the government will find it real challenge to answer that we see the foreign policy issue in place such as the middle east people say your perspective on how international law be apply in the middle east may explain how you be deal with the situation back home with regard to faith community and anti muslim hatred when we ask people to apply international law in ukraine they will probably ask we to apply international law when it come to the middle east that be why we have the whole dilemma in uk foreign policy about get more people from the non align state to join we they want consistent approach across the board internationally back home in the uk we need to make sure that we treat all faith community fairly and equally with the same resource and structure at the moment be not see that in engagement with the muslim community rise order let try again if every colleague take minute the follow debate will have to be cancel urge deny ordinance as have raise in this house multiple time have receive islamophobic abuse since be elect for example just this week post on social medium video of my comment about migrant survivor of domestic abuse during the debate on the victims and prisoners bill will not read the bad response receive which contain swearing but here be some of the other you be give job in england uk to help england all you care about be your own feel free to leave at any point what about all the immigrant rap our child you delude fool ban all muslim mps they represent muslims not the native their loyalty be to their own this be not islamabad deport you be traitor and will be prosecute in if england do kick you and every other ungrateful foreign beggar out very soon there will be no england anymore you be much happy in muslim country begum people like you should be expel from parliament the only people you represent be foreign national that the problem with islam woman be treat as second class by the man you need to recognise the truth about this primitive religion muslims do have beautiful clothe only ugly headscarf there be no invention only destruction want to make it clear to the house that those be just example of the regular almost daily abuse that have have to learn to cope with and they be from just my most recent social medium post also receive threat online via voicemail and email and by letter the situation be escalate exacerbate by those try to capitalise on current event by spread their hate and division and now face heightened and very serious risk to my safety it be important to recognise that what be experience as the first hijab wear mp reflect grow current within society the data show that muslims be the large target of religiously motivated hate crime follow the october hamas attack which result in around israeli death include those of civilian and child and the subsequent israeli military assault which have kill more than palestinians include civilian and child hate crime against both jews and muslims have rise dramatically in europe in the uk tell mama have report increase in attack on muslims include attack and hostility against individual and mosque with child target at school death threat and physical attack islamophobic hate crime not only affect the victim but send reverberation through community as they reinforce establish pattern of bias prejudice and discrimination islam and muslims have increasingly be see as culturally dangerous and threaten to the british way of life we be constantly scapegoate and misrepresent and label both deviant and evil be call supporter of terrorism or terrorist or be hold responsible as group for terrorism be common theme the reality be that islamophobia be widespread and relate to whole structure of discrimination the socioeconomic discrimination and inequality that muslims face make we the most economically disadvantaged faith group in the uk at the same time muslims face institutional discrimination for some time it have be widely understand include by the united nations that approach to counter terrorism be model on islamophobic stereotype policy and political structure but government document leak in november reveal that official have draw up controversial proposal to broaden the definition of extremism even far to include organisation such as the muslim council of britain yet this government will not even recognise islamophobia when muslims be the target of hate the government be silent they allow social medium to perpetuate narrative of terrorism about muslims while fail to call out those who misrepresent and generalise about muslims more than that they recklessly stoke the hate by peddle their so call culture war against the british people pander to culture that tell people it be acceptable to discriminate against to persecute and to abuse muslims across europe the situation be alarming with the threat of the far right on the rise include the re emergence of far right party and politician such as geert wilders whether in india france china or iran believe it should be up to woman to choose what they wear no state and no man should have the right to overrule that this september mark year since the murder of mahsa amini in iran when she be murder the prime minister be right to describe the iranian regime attack on woman protest for their right to not wear the hijab as abhorrent but the government be silent about the outlawing of muslim woman right to wear the abaya in france and where be the government outrage at the fact that government office across europe can now ban employee from wear religious symbol such as headscarf in the interest of so call neutrality after court be ask to rule on the case of muslim employee in belgium who be tell that she could not wear headscarf at work be concern and alarm by that because it could exacerbate the marginalisation of muslims at time when islamophobia be already on the rise the constituency that represent have long and proud history of migration and anti racism whether that be our jewish community and ally oppose fascist at the battle of cable street in or our bangladeshi community lead the anti fascist mobilisation in after the murder of altab ali we be one of the most culturally diverse area in the uk and we be damn proud of it we will always stand together multiracial of all faith and none against division and intolerance welcome the debate on behalf of the million muslims in the united kingdom and the significant number who be my constituent in hendon since october there have be many incident of racism follow the terrorist attack in israel subsequently the number of antisemitic incident have rise to more than the same would probably be true of attack within the muslim community receive regular report from the metropolitan police about hate crime take place in the borough of barnet and be extremely concerned to read that many be link to the current conflict in israel and gaza on brent street in hendon there be fast food restaurant call lahore which constituent tell have be vandalise he attribute the attack to islamophobia do not know whether that be true but do know that jewish restaurant in golders green be also attack and the police refuse to categorise that incident as antisemitic regardless of who attack either of they or why the business owner be leave with financial bill as result of those extremist action believe that islamophobia exist in this country as indeed do antisemitism but do not accept that it be accept and embed in the united kingdom society the debate have be posit as conflict between one group of people in the united kingdom and those who hold different religion that appear to frame the discussion as an otherness of those who be islamic but do not see that particularly not in my constituency in fact there be significant share concern between my different community for example muslims and jews both share belief around halal and shechita and issue with the coroner service have campaign long and hard on seek death certificate within hour the promotion of faith school be important to both community as be single sex space in place such as hospital people in the united kingdom sometimes do denigrate muslims because they perceive they as homogenous entity but that be far from the truth it be interesting that no one have so far raise the great schism in islam that of the sunni and divide put simply the contention centre on the succession of the prophet muhammad and whether his grandson or one of his follower should be consider to be next in the line of succession that have be the cause of conflict for hundred of year and be the basis of proxy conflict happen right now in yemen lebanon syria and other part of africa as non muslim it be not for to say how the line of succession should occur or to dictate whether one strand of islam be more legitimate than another but it be incumbent on to acknowledge the difference and as democratically elect representative to give voice to the minority and defend their right to exist in recent year the divide have be attribute as justification for sectarian violence in iraq daesh commit atrocity against yazidi man and woman and use extremist ideology to justify their crime by call their victim devil worshipper in syria the druze community have face persistent attack which have lead to oppose clan come together in common cause against their syrian attacker the conflict in syria have also feed into existential fear among lebanon druze community in part due to attack on the syrian jews and alawites who be denounce as non muslims and target for extreme violence we have hear today about muslims suffer discrimination and violence in bosnia myanmar and china those be all example of islamic atrocity overseas however the murder in of asad shah in scotland expose not just islamophobia but downright hatred of ahmadi muslims here in the united kingdom the murderer sunni muslim have drive from bradford with the intent of confront mr shah because he be an open adherent of the ahmadiyya branch of islam which believe that the prophet mohammed be not the final muslim prophet the judge say that mr shah be regard by those who know he as peaceful and peace love family man who go out of his way to show respect for those of any faith she say that his murder be an appalling display of merciless violence and tell the murderer that he be responsible for the barbaric premeditated and wholly unjustified killing of much love man who be pillar of the local community as have be mention about other murder mr shah too be repeatedly stab and have his face stamp on the muslim council of britain put out statement after the murder of mr shah which state that it affirm the right of ahmadis to their freedom of belief and reject attack upon they but the mcb state that its theological position be fundamentally opposed to the ahmadi community and that no muslim should be force to class ahmadis as muslims if they do not wish to do so think that would be anathema to many hon member in the chamber and particularly those who advocate self identification in other sphere of life be it not right for the individual to decide what religion they identify with and for that person to be allow view even if it be not share by other as be attribute to voltaire may not agree with what you say but defend your right to say it article of the universal declaration of human right state everyone have the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion this right include freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom either alone or in community with other and in public or private to manifest his religion or belief in teaching practice worship and observance that be where see difference between british muslims and those from around the world the clue be in the name british unlike in some culture the issue of british value supersede other prejudice our shared belief in common value surround decency fair play respect for the law and free speech be also share by british muslims when visit faith school in my constituency such as barnet hill academy in west hendon see those value be instill in the child alongside their muslim faith all of we must ensure that that continue the united kingdom can lead by example in july the un express its deep concern about the lack of attention to the serious human right violation perpetrate against the ahmadiyya muslim community around the world and call on the international community to step up effort to bring an end to the ongoing persecution of ahmadi muslims that have include discriminatory legislative and policy framework the targeting of ahmadi muslims through exclusion hate campaign and violence include arbitrary arrest and detention verbal and physical attack in the public sphere and attack against their cultural site and place of worship ahmadi woman be particularly affect as they face harassment and discrimination due to their distinctive traditional attire which make they immediately recognisable while ahmadi child and youth be often deny admission to school and high educational institution because of their faith they also constantly suffer intimidation and bullying force they to interrupt or drop out of their study report also indicate that ahmadis be still portray in negative light in school textbook while ahmadiyya educational institution be often seize and administratively close by state authority it be my belief that tackle islamophobia be not restrict to non muslims and muslims be grateful to the hon member for give way and associate myself with his comment about ensure that we end all persecution of all muslim community whether that be the ahmadiyya community or the community for declaration purpose my family and come from the lineage of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam peace be upon he many in my family be of heritage and belief and many be sunni be struggle to understand the idea here we be talk about islamophobia but the debate have be take elsewhere do not think that that be the intention of the hon member who be make valid point about persecution but do he not agree that the intersection of muslim upon muslim hatred be not islamophobia in the context of what this afternoon debate be about encourage he to speak to people perhaps we could have chat would not mind coffee just to unpick some of that because it do worry perhaps we should have kahwa instead of coffee the hon member hit on really good point but see islamophobia and antisemitism hope that make this clear as simply racism there can still be inter faith racism where one sect say that another be not legitimate that be still the denigration of particular community for that be still islamophobia and racism and it be unacceptable but be grateful to she for her comment and for accept the premise of my argument to conclude if islamophobia racism or whatever we want to call it be to be address all muslims must be prepare to demonstrate tolerance not only of other faith but of their own it be only then through lead by example that we can attack and address other cause of islamophobia which have acknowledge exist in this country as well as abroad and take action against people who be denigrate other thank the backbench business committee for propose today important debate and all my fellow member of the appg on british muslims for their work also thank somebody from the other place baroness sayeeda warsi the treasurer of the appg for her constant work and for hold up mirror to we all but particularly to her own party and for the courage and strength that she show in do that it be privilege to listen to and take part in this emotive powerful and timely debate islamophobia be scourge on society it be on all of we to tackle it call it out and educate it be something close to my heart and declare my interest as the co chair of the appg on british muslims firmly believe that it should not be leave to british muslims to tackle islamophobia in this country it be on all of we to build fair inclusive society which we can all benefit from and to highlight the huge contribution that muslims make to our country see those contribution in my constituency every single day through inspirational charity work public service and business if anyone want to see great representation of how diversity be strength encourage people to look at the video of luton town football club fan leave kenilworth road in the constituency of my hon friend the member for luton south rachel hopkins on news of our promotion to the premier league after the team historic win take they to wembley they enter bury park to the sound of dhol drum irish band and people of all faith and none and of all background and age celebrate together as one multiculturalism be alive and kick in town such as luton it be strength to be the town of many voice that we be have be fortunate to meet fantastic people from across the country live their faith through action and learn something new with every meeting when visit the british muslim heritage centre in the constituency of my hon friend the member for manchester gorton afzal khan learn that an invention by muslims be the thing that get go and power throughout the day coffee which be possibly the great invention especially for any parent or shift worker would like to spend more time talk about the great work be do in luton north by our muslim community whether it be through organisation such as inspire eid discover islam curry kitchen and faiths united or internationally through islamic relief and the muslim council of britain unfortunately hate crime be so rife that less time be now afford to the wonderful contribution of muslim community in our country instead we have to spend so much time talk about the horrific impact of islamophobia as well as other form of discrimination it come as no surprise to anyone that racist do not stay in their lane hatred rear its ugly head in the form of misogyny homophobia antisemitism anti black hatred as well as anti disabled discrimination in many instance perpetrator will not just limit their hatred to one protect characteristic often the victim will be pick out for more than one issue face barrage of hatred for multiple part of who they be that be especially true for muslim woman black muslims and disabled muslims we have hear horrific example of that from my hon friend the member for poplar and limehouse apsana begum who be dear friend just for do her job accord to statistic from the home office hate crime target muslims rise by last year make muslims the most targeted religious group almost half of religious hate crime be direct towards muslims and with the atrocity take place in the middle east we be see an even more horrific rise in islamophobia tell mama report an increase in recent incident of islamophobia in the uk of over that be concern enough on its own but it be only the tip of the iceberg as the level of under reporting and misreporting be likely to be considerable that be why we desperately need the government to adopt the cross party definition of islamophobia that would be just start in tackle the problem head on how can the government begin to tackle islamophobia if they refuse to define what it be for year we have hear that the government would be look into that my hon friend the member for manchester gorton afzal khan have push hard on it as have other yet we have hear nothing but silence just more hold answer and delay as the incidence of islamophobia continue to rise that simply be not good enough so will the minister give assurance that an agree definition of islamophobia will be come from the government and explain the real reason for the delay would also be grateful if she confirm that the additional funding announce by the chancellor in the autumn statement rightly to tackle the rise in antisemitism as the hon member for gillingham and rainham rehman chishti raise will be match or at least that the department for levelling up housing and communities will fight for that to tackle islamophobia at the same rate while we wait more people will be subject to abuse intimidation and violence without standard that institution and individual be hold to and be accountable for more than attack have be commit against muslims since how many more must happen how much more misery must be inflict before the government act as my hon friend the member for bradford west naz shah an ardent campaigner against islamophobia have call for many time when will the long promise adviser on islamophobia be announce and importantly work with let turn to the intersectional aspect of islamophobia which be incredibly important particularly for young generation we know the horrific impact and the rise in islamophobic attack follow the description that the former prime minister and former member for uxbridge give of veiled woman as letterboxe research from tell mama show that islamophobic incident rise shocking the week after those comment from someone who clearly should have know well but sadly do not constituent in luton north contact to share their anger and concern which share about the impact of the slur against pakistani man make by the former home secretary or should refer to she as another contender for the tory leadership those slur be found not in evidence but in mongering and islamophobia it be beholden on all of we in this place and in position of power to lead by example and to continue to learn educate ourselves and challenge our own prejudice be anti racist be something to consistently strive for many have lot to learn still especially when it come to intersectionality and islamophobia shockat patel board member of muslim engagement and development report lot of woman say they be fearful of go out just because of the fact they be wear headscarf for those that wear niqab they find it even more difficult because they know almost certainly that they be go to get verbal abuse the visibility of muslim woman increase the chance of their be target for hatred they experience the double whammy of misogyny and racism often compound when class be also factor in that discrimination create barrier to talented compassionate and experience muslim woman in many walk of life include in the workplace access service particularly important for muslims with disability representation in the medium and sadly in politic and in other form of public life we be all the bad off because we be miss out on the good and widest pool of talent representation matter not just in politic but in every walk of life the constant use of culture war to stoke division and hatred by those in power who should know well be dead end it be detrimental to we all especially those of we who want fair safe and more inclusive society on the flipside we can also see positive step be take internationally lead to progress this year the united nations hold the first ever international day to combat islamophobia on march that be after resolution back by muslim member state be pass by the un general assembly the un call on all un member state to mark the day by recognise islamophobia and work to combat it can the minister tell we whether that be mark and recognise by the uk government if not do they plan to do so next year the point want to end on be that we can do well than this if we be to build safe fair and inclusive country for all we must do well and that start with the leadership of this country and in particular the leadership of the conservative government who have all too often be find want on the challenge of islamophobia despite what some politician and medium outlet describe as wake issue islamophobia affect entire community our village town and city across the country and internationally it be poison that know no boundary we know that the world be an incredibly unstable and volatile place especially for people of faith the example of state sanction islamophobia that we see in xinjiang against the uyghurs be an affront to humanity the report of torture imprisonment killing and denial of people religion breach multiple human right law and it be genuinely welcome that the house be unite in the condemnation of those atrocity however many resident in my constituency have contact and share their condemnation of senior member of the netanyahu government speak about flatten gaza or enact gaza nakba that be compound by other dehumanising language with israel president claim that there be no innocent civilian in gaza when it come to genocide we look back at history we even stand in this chamber and we utter the word never again yet here we be star at it from afar know that this tragedy be now the present for the uyghurs and real threat for the palestinian people if we be to avoid the further ethnic cleansing of palestinians urge the minister to speak directly to their colleague in the foreign commonwealth and development office to ensure that the uk back the united nations unprecedented call to invoke article of the un charter for ceasefire to protect civilian population we must ensure that we work as an international community and strain every sinew in the pursuit of peace an urgent last ceasefire between hamas and israel an end to the loss of innocent life and the freeing of hostage to ensure that the current atrocity be endure be no one else future be delighted to follow the hon member for luton north sarah owen put on record my thank to the hon member for bradford west naz shah and for peterborough paul bristow for secure this important debate we have perhaps become accustomed in this place to debate islamophobia abroad we have become accustomed to talk about the uyghur muslims and srebrenica which be mention early my concern however be that we have become negligent and too often overlook what be happen at home perhaps the time have come to look inward as my party equality spokesperson be increasingly concern by the islamophobia we be see across the country and by the effect on my own community in edinburgh west as their constituency mp in edinburgh west we have significant and vibrant muslim community we have mosque in the blackhall area with which be in regular contact we have open day and surgery however like many community across the country there be an underlying tension that be not acceptable report from the scottish parliament cross party group on tackle islamophobia with newcastle university show that more than of muslims in scotland who respond to the survey say that family member have experience islamophobia some of those same people think it be get bad some of muslims say that islamophobia be regular or everyday issue in scottish society as we have hear islamophobia be often gendere with woman be target for wear hijab or niqab for too long we have see islamophobia as problem that affect other place and other country as say it be time we look close to home yes we must question the government but we all must also question ourselves this debate come at crucial point in our cultural and social history in this country as the horror of the war in israel and gaza be far heighten those tension that have mention it be create fear in muslim and jewish community across the country in recent meeting with tell mama and representative of the community security trust both group express their concern about the damage be do to the relationship between their community they also outline their fear about the abuse be suffer significantly online but also in person at that point almost islamophobic incident have be report in the first day after october which be sixfold increase on the same period last year muslims be face abuse and dehumanising slur across society that be not just unacceptable for muslims to face it be unacceptable for anyone in our society believe that we be all responsible for what happen each and every one of we thank the hon member for share with we all the statistic from scotland may say how delighted be to learn that every single political party in scotland have accept the definition include the scottish conservative party do she not agree that now it be time that this parliament take through the motion with the support of all party the hon member be absolutely right it be time that not just all the scottish party but that all of we accept the definition take it through parliament and make sure that it be recognise would not want to patronise the muslim community the jewish community or any other community in this country by tell they that understand what it be like to suffer the hatred that they suffer on daily basis but like to think that be aware of it and will do everything can to support they in fight it because every community should feel safe that be important to as an individual think it be the hon member for bradford west who say the issue be not about give priority to any community it be about equality for all community and ensure that every community feel safe and secure ask the house to consider that if any member feel insecure they should think about how it can be address if we feel secure if we feel that we have never be the subject of hatred or hatred towards our community we should think what can we do to ensure that other community and other individual feel the same way want briefly to raise few point about my constituency have multicultural constituency it have be migrant community for more than hundred year and there be sizeable muslim community in fact help establish the first mosque the islamic centre in the centre of year ago we rub together pretty well at the weekend we have an open day at the islamic centre to talk about how the different religion work together there be particular discussion about the role of jesus christ and think it be interesting and fascinating to hear people view nevertheless we do have problem before october we have an arson attack on the muslim woman centre in yeading lane in hayes for the woman the tragedy of it be that the arsonist burn through the room where the holy koran be store the house can imagine the distress cause previously raise this issue with minister on the floor of the house and be give an assurance that there would be support at the moment we be seek meeting with civil servant to go through the detail any help the minister could provide in arrange that meeting would be really helpful because it be quite press as the insurance money hopefully come through to repair the building we need the security put in place fairly rapidly political party have to be straight with one another on this issue with regard to the conservative party baroness warsi have play an exceptional role heroic role can not understand why the human rights council do not carry out an investigation into the conservative party when baroness warsi and other produce their report about the islamophobia within that party and think it reflect badly on the hrc normally support the hrc in fact have be on picket line in support of its staff when there be staff cut but think it need to examine its behaviour that regard turn to the labour party we have to be straight know that at the moment in the labour party be straight can sometimes be dangerous want to raise number of point first the labour muslim network which be found number of year ago do an excellent job in research and expose islamophobia within our own party we need to listen to that can not understand how three year on the labour muslim network be try to establish itself as formal affiliate to the labour party but still have not be allow to affiliate secondly it be accurately report that in my local area for example ali milani who be one of the founder of the labour muslim network and be an excellent candidate for uxbridge in the general election be warn off stand again in the by election it be make clear that he would not be allow to stand which be unacceptable put on record that any party that allow the deselection of my hon friend the member for poplar and limehouse apsana begum be not protect the muslim community in the way would expect it to want to send that message have raise these issue in private have write to the leader of the labour party and the reason be now raise they in public be that have not have sufficiently positive response that address those issue the final point want to make with regard to the labour party be this why be it that when someone be accuse of islamophobia and they apologise disciplinary action be then end and there be no issue with regard to the whip or whatever but in number of instance where person have be accuse of antisemitism the whip be withdraw and they spend month await any form of investigatory process in his inquiry into the labour party martin forde address the issue of potential hierarchy of racism within our party and be afraid that the way in which we treat individual reinforce that concern we all condemn antisemitism and islamophobia but we have to treat all form of racism with equivalence as well as the individual against whom allegation have be make think we have job of work in our own political party to ensure that we tackle islamophobia effectively in way that will make we particularly the labour party the anti racist party that we have always want to be and an example to other political party finally want to emphasise the point that the hon member for peterborough paul bristow make at every meeting have in my constituency with regard to the muslim community be so proud of the way that it that have come forward in migrant community over the past to year and now play such significant role in my constituency but also nationally whenever there be problem whenever there be an issue that need support on and put the call out it be the islamic centre and the mosque that come forward and provide the resource in fact the islamic centre in hayes be visit by the prince and princess of wales only few month ago just to thank the people there for the work they have do in raise fund for afghanistan and elsewhere put on record my thank to the muslim community and my gratitude for all the work they do and my pride in be able to represent the muslim community in my constituency islamophobia be an insidious kind of racism that be prevalent not just in british society but globally across the world islamophobia look like the continue torture in concentration camp of uyghur muslims in china the merciless killing of worshipper in new zealand and the ongoing persecution of rohingya muslims at the hand of myanmar brutal regime commend the un for designate march as the international day to combat islamophobia and thank the organisation of islamic cooperation for its effort recognise the existence of islamophobia and how it plague society be vital if we be to begin to tackle it canada and the european commission have task key individual with combat islamophobia and to mark islamophobia awareness month the us have announce that it will develop national strategy to counter islamophobia regrettably we do not have the same leadership domestically despite islamophobia damage public and political life in britain most victim of religious hate crime in the uk be muslims and in october islamophobic incident be up by recent report find that of british mosque experience religiously motivate attack at least once year islamophobia be not just hate crime it permeate every aspect of muslim life muslims be more likely to live in poverty they be the uk least like religious group and most muslims have experience religion base discrimination in their everyday life all of that make it hard for muslims to live as equal member of british society when be first elect to this house swear my oath in english and urdu language that queen victoria also proudly speak be then subject to barrage of hate for dare to speak another language and for boldly express my muslimness there be small but increasingly vocal minority in this country who hate the idea of rich pluralistic society that british muslims contribute to it be that minority that we all must stand up to and to do so we must have clear community endorse definition of islamophobia in follow extensive consultation with academic expert and faith community the all party group on british muslims formulate definition of islamophobia in the year since every political party except the conservatives have adopt that definition alongside council elect mayors trade union academic and community group across the country however there be one blocker to uk wide adoption of formal definition of islamophobia the tory government they reject the expert definition put forward by the appg claim that it be inconsistent with the equality act to adopt that definition of islamophobia at government level would not be legally binding it would be intend to serve as workable measure for action against islamophobia no legislative change be be propose so the equality act would not be undermine in reality most act that be deem islamophobic under the appg definition would also be consider religious discrimination under the equality act the appg definition and the equality act complement each other one do not challenge the other give that the government argument against that definition do not stand up and consider that they have abandon all plan to develop their own definition can the minister outline why the government still think that the appg definition of islamophobia breach the equality act if it be not legally binding imagine that this government be reluctant to adopt any definition of islamophobia because the long we do not have one the long the conservative party can not be in breach of it for fail to deal with the widespread islamophobia within its own rank in the local election early this year three conservative councillor be re elect despite have previously be suspend for alleged islamophobia and racism with no information provide on why they be readmitte to the party and deem fit for public office if we be to begin to tackle islamophobia in british society we need strong leadership and commitment from the very top to root out this dangerous hate other nation across the world be wake up to the threat that islamophobia pose and be do something about it but not the uk the long the tories stay in government the long we will have no leadership and no action on islamophobia my constituent and british muslims across the country deserve well be pleased to be able to speak in today debate which be so brilliantly open by my good and hon friend the member for bradford west naz shah as member of parliament represent significant muslim community some of my constituency population be muslim understand just how important tackle islamophobia be and be grateful for this debate we all in this place have duty to ensure that the uk be welcoming tolerant place for all irrespective of religion or belief we must stand up to religious hatred in all its form be proud of the rich contribution that muslim community make to the united kingdom but sadly we have people who seek to sow division by spread racism and hatred islamophobia be far too prevalent in our society follow consultation with academic lawyer and muslim organisation the all party parliamentary group on british muslims define islamophobia say that it be root in racism and be type of racism that target expression of muslimness or perceive muslimness labour be proud to adopt the all party group definition in the conservatives be the only major political party to continue to refuse to adopt that definition even though the scottish conservatives have do so identify racism and know how to tackle it be of paramount importance in around of religious hate crime record by police be islamophobic muslims have form the high proportion of victim of religiously motivate hate crime for each of the past five year and we know that muslim woman often suffer great discrimination and form the majority of victim of hate crime as result of be more easily identify as muslim as note by the department for levelling up housing and communities the community security trust and tell mama rise tension in the middle east can lead to an increase in anti muslim and antisemitic incident in the uk we know that antisemitic and islamophobic hate crime incident have both increase tell mama report sevenfold increase in anti muslim incident between and october compare with the same period last year we expect to see robust response to all incident of hate associate with the conflict there be no place in britain for islamophobia just as there be no place for antisemitism we must not allow these tragic event to divide our community in luton we have history of oppose those seek to sow division and spread racism we recognise that our beautiful cultural fabric be make up of many voice but we come together to speak as one town that mean diversity be our strength we know that understand each other be essential to create harmonious society and help to tackle inaccurate fear use to underpin racist ideology luton council of faiths work to establish maintain and celebrate mutual respect friendship and tolerance in luton include through our luton in harmony initiative over the past decade luton council of faiths comprise representative from wide range of religion include christian hindu jewish muslim quaker and sikh among other open dialogue across our community be so important to break down any bias and prejudice luton have always be welcome town with muslim diaspora from across the world whether that be from europe asia or africa many excellent local community event have help to create this robust cohesion during ramadan there be the big iftar in the town centre where people from all our community come to break their fast together as well as the unity iftar at madinah mosque on oak road which be host by its neighbour luton town football club event such as these bring people together to understand the muslim faith be also proud that luton labour have develop and encourage many muslim member to get involve in democratic institution by stand and get elect as local councillor be pleased to say that luton labour group have not only majority of woman councillor but within that majority of muslim woman councillor and be proud to campaign alongside they every week but recognise that sadly they have be target for abuse which be simply unacceptable take this opportunity to give recognition to this year civic mayor of luton my good friend councillor yaqub hanif who have be excellent at demonstrate that to tackle division and discrimination we must all focus on equality inclusivity and tolerance finish by say once again how proud be to represent luton and our wonderfully diverse town our muslim community be integral to our town identity and be their ally and in the strong possible term against anyone who seek to spread islamophobia ask the minister again whether this conservative government will adopt the cross party appg definition of islamophobia as the labour party do in and if not why not express my gratitude to the backbench business committee for provide this platform for debate of such importance congratulate my hon friend the member for bradford west naz shah the hon member for peterborough paul bristow and other on have secure it once again rise to speak in this chamber to address pervasive issue that continue to affect our society deeply the distressing rise of islamophobia this matter be significant not just to british muslims but to the very essence of what our country stand for the muslim community especially in my slough constituency make huge and positive contribution to our economy and society today though be here to voice my concern and to challenge the government inaction and indifference towards islamophobia the statistic show the stark reality for many muslims in great britain an alarming of all religious hate crime last year target muslims that highlight the fact that significant portion of our society endure persistent discrimination and fear due to their faith an issue on which have campaign tirelessly such statistic and the one provide by tell mama and other respected organisation should make we all very concerned and they highlight the need for action the current israel hamas conflict mark by grave humanitarian crisis with more than death have tragically fuel rise in both antisemitism and islamophobia the harrowing image of death and devastation broadcast globally underscore the profound indirect impact that such conflict have on societal attitude exacerbate domestic prejudice and hate in the uk this time of global distress should prompt call for unity not be catalyst for further division and conflict the world do not need more conflict and we must urgently push for peace the conservative government hesitation to formally define islamophobia despite widespread call for they to do so mark significant failure their reluctance hinder our collective effort to effectively confront and mitigate this hate crime notably the all party parliamentary group on british muslims which have serve as chair have define islamophobia as form of racism target manifestation of muslimness or perceive muslimness that definition be crucial in understanding and tackle the multifaceted nature of islamophobia and have raise this issue on previous occasion in various meeting sikh have be target taunt and even shoot dead as in the us simply because of the way they look have be mistake for muslims because of their turban and beard hate fill killer in arizona for example shoot to death sikh outside his petrol station the attacker have reportedly declare that he want to go out and shoot some towelhead this government failure to recognise and adopt that definition despite all the other major and mainstream political party have adopt it imply that they be neglect the complexity of islamophobia leave its victim without the necessary protection and support the government failure to define islamophobia couple with divisive rhetoric and policy especially concern immigration and the invoking of culture war have fuel an atmosphere in which islamophobia and other form of racism have flourish the government approach have be mark by language that alienate and vilify specific group contribute to climate of fear and misunderstanding that be exemplified when the former prime minister boris johnson refer to woman wear burqa as look like bank robber and letterboxe statement that not only demean religious practice but inflame anti muslim sentiment such racist remark especially from political leader have tangible impact embolden prejudicial attitude against muslim community they lead to huge spike in hate crime against muslim woman with some hate consume individual throw egg and tomato at they there be still no independent inquiry into islamophobia in the conservative party despite the then prime minister and then chancellor promise it on national television in my role as labour member of parliament and an elect representative of slough be committed to oppose divisive tactic and to foster britain that thrive on its diversity we must envisage nation that unite in its varied cultural and religious make up stand against any rhetoric that seek to divide we base on race religion or origin for example in slough major multicultural hub our strength lie in our diversity and it be crucial to ensure that every community feel safe and respected we aim to develop policy that promote integration and cohesion address racism and discrimination proactively and reactively indeed our nation rich cultural and religious diversity be its core strength uphold and celebrate that diversity be vital to maintain britain stand as beacon of pluralism and inclusion by actively condemn the intolerant individual who engage in racism and hate crime in all its form we commit to society that value and respect every single individual the time for mere word have pass we need government who not only acknowledge but actively implement policy to combat islamophobia we have hear some excellent example from right hon and hon member today it be crucial to address its root cause foster understanding and create society where hatred find no sanctuary in debate on islamophobia in parliament two year ago speak up about my experience as left wing muslim woman in the public eye speak up about the barrage of hate receive on daily basis talk about be call cancer and be tell that my muslim mob be danger to humanity as well as about how people tell to go back to my own country that be difficult claim to get my head around must admit since be bear in birmingham speak about the bad effect of islamophobia and about how they be shape in this very chamber at that very dispatch box in policy and political decision from attack on civil liberty at home to disastrous decision to wage war abroad would like to say that in the two year since thing have change and people have listen and that people take islamophobia more seriously but can not if anything thing have get bad in recent week as have stand up for the right of the palestinian people have experience new wave of hate because be muslim who support the right of the palestinians far right trolls widely share claim that be hamas supporter repeat the allegation no matter how many time condemn hamas killing of civilian because be muslim when speak up about palestinian child be indiscriminately slaughter people write to tell keep your eff mouth shut you muslim bitch and because be muslim when call for ceasefire and an end to the bloodshed view support by of the british public but not this house someone write to say it be who be anti democratic and anti british and be again tell to go home want to live in country that look after the poor and the vulnerable at home and respect human right and international law abroad and where the nhs be fully fund home be not mouldy or unaffordable everyone can go to university without have to worry about debt and every single person can put food on the table and keep roof above their head but for some people the colour of my skin and the religion choose to follow mean be beyond the pale that be difficult to process but what make it hard be know that that racism do not come from vacuum as say in the debate two year ago that hate be not innate or natural it be teach from the very top by people in position of power and privilege for example despite home office report say that most child sexual abuse gang be make up of white man and there be no evidence that groom gang be disproportionately black or asian early this year the then home secretary the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman falsely say that groom gang be almost all british claim so strikingly wrong that even the press regulator call it out it be not just politician fan the flame of hate shortly after give my speech the muslim council of britain centre for media monitoring publish report on the british medium coverage of muslims and islam analyse almost article and broadcast clip it paint very disturbing picture of how muslims be portray in the medium article antagonistic to muslims be find to outnumber supportive article by ratio of seven to one islamophobic trope be pervasive with the spectator for example ask tough question such as can muslims learn to put country before faith community the report find that false anti muslim generalisation often go unchallenged on broadcast medium recently we have see islamophobia spout by journalist such as the newspaper editor who say that much of muslim culture be in the grip of death cult with that steady drip feeding of hate it be little wonder that racist tell be not british that be the message right wing outlet publish with dog whistle and sometimes even foghorn but as say the bad effect of this hate be not abusive language but policy and political decision and we see that today early this year long await review into the deeply controversial and widely discredit prevent programme be publish the review be lead by someone whose anti muslim view be already well know and who have say for example europe and islam be one of the great most terrifying problem of our future that person have be hand pick for the job by government lead by man who mock muslim woman as bank robber and letterboxe it be little wonder that the review totally ignore the programme discriminatory impact and undermining of democratic freedom of course islamophobia be not confine to this country we see dehumanisation at home and abroad even liberal british newspaper do not talk about palestinian child instead refer quote recent article to palestinians aged and under the palestinian people as whole be often depict and treat as terrorist deserve not of right and self determination but of suppression or even elimination in india prime minister modi have introduce discriminatory anti muslim legislation and anti muslim mob violence be become normalise in china shock human right abuse and the suppression of uyghur muslims be well document in the us we have see horrify attack in recent week the six year old palestinian american wadea al fayoume be kill after be stab time with his landlord charge with the boy murder and three young palestinians be gun down in what be believe to be hate crime for the apparent wrongdoing of speak arabic and wear keffiyehs across europe the islamophobic far right be on the rise from the hate fill and openly islamophobic geert wilders in the netherlands to le pen continue advance in france much close to home as discuss in the debate two year ago still have serious concern about my party handling of islamophobia the forde report into the labour party commission by the party national executive committee and carry out by the distinguished martin forde kc publish its final report in summer last year it find that the party be operate hierarchy of racism or of discrimination with other form of racism and discrimination such as islamophobia and anti black racism be ignore martin forde reiterate that view this year with stark warning that still have not be listen to that be why along with the labour muslim network have call for an independent inquiry into islamophobia in the labour party today both islamophobia and antisemitism be rise sharply across britain but they be not disconnected struggle or compete concern as some people like to portray they the far right thug who attack one group of we today will go for the other group tomorrow the politician who whip up hatred against migrant now will want other scapegoat in the future and history tell we that jewish people and muslims be often at the top of their list for the fight against islamophobia and the fight against antisemitism be part of the same struggle the fight to live in the world where everyone no matter their race or religion be able to live in dignity and freedom believe that we be make strong not by not pit our community against each other but by unite our struggle and find solidarity and safety call the snp spokesperson may start by thank the hon member for bradford west naz shah for the way in which she lead the debate do not think there be single important part of this matter that she do not touch on extremely well will pick up on one thing the issue of definition not the appg definition which will come to but the united nations definition the un describe islamophobia as fear prejudice and hatred of muslims that lead to provocation hostility and intolerance by mean of threaten harassment abuse incitement and intimidation of muslims and non muslims both in the online and offline world motivate by institutional ideological political and religious hostility that transcend into structural and cultural racism it target the symbol and marker of be muslim that be very technical description will come back to the evidence of what it mean to muslims in scotland on day to day basis and then to the rather less technical definition to stay with the united nations for moment the recent report by the un special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief find that suspicion discrimination and outright hatred towards muslims have rise to epidemic proportion the un say follow the terrorist attack of september and other act of terrorism purportedly carry out in the name of islam institutional suspicion of muslims and those perceive to be muslim have escalate to epidemic proportion and widespread negative representation of islam and harmful stereotype that depict muslims and their belief and culture as threat have serve to perpetuate validate and normalise discrimination hostility and violence towards muslim individual and community all that be deeply disturbing but what do it mean in practice for muslims in scotland well the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine who be no long in her place touch on that the scottish parliament cross party group on challenge racial and religious prejudice and newcastle university have tell we great deal of muslims say that islamophobia be an everyday issue of muslims say that they have friend or family member who have experience it of muslims be fearful of experience it argue that social medium increase it say that the broadcast medium promote it and say that the print medium promote it we know and it have be report that muslim woman be disproportionately target in islamophobic hate crime again those finding from real people be deeply worrying what though be the official measured scale of the problem in scotland well the number of charge bring for religious hate crime in scotland over the decade between and sit at constant of about year sadly the number of charge for all hate crime in scotland sit at around year in only one year of that same decade have the number rise above but in only one year have it fall below so there be constant background noise of religious and other hatred we also know from the statistic that of all religious hate crime be direct at muslims be sure we would all agree that no right minded person would argue that those number be anything other than too high hearteningly police scotland and the procurator fiscal service take these matter seriously it be report that more than of all the charge for religious hate crime do end up in court that will cover multitude of sin but believe at least that that matter be take seriously we can not therefore dismiss islamophobia simply because the number of those charge have sit constantly at year we can not disregard any hate crime when the number be sit at about year in scotland we can not downplay the impact of islamophobia because as we have hear from the cross party group and other the effect on people be widespread and profound we can not diminish the impact of islamophobia on muslims or the rest of society simply because high proportion of the perpetrator be drag to court although be glad that that be the case and we can not wish away the problem tackle it will need cogent coherent and concrete action with clear political leadership let return to the report by the scottish parliament cross party group among many recommendation it tell we that scotland need urgent education reform to combat the scourge of islamophobia be certain that be the case in england too it tell we that muslim woman in scotland be more likely to encounter islamophobia than man and call for funding and support for organisation and initiative that promote social cohesion and integration particularly for muslim woman be certain that that demand would be mirror in england as well will not go through the list of the many other recommendation the group make all of which agree with want now to get to the point on definition because the cross party group persuade all of scotland political party to adopt the formal definition of islamophobia that be describe as landmark moment that will help tackle prejudice in scotland member of the all party group here will recognise the definition islamophobia be root in racism and be type of racism that target expression of muslimness or perceive muslimness if every political party represent in the scottish parliament can formally adopt that would agree with the labour chair of the scottish parliament cross party group who say now urge the uk government to adopt the definition so that we can challenge hatred and prejudice wherever it exist across the country that do not strike as be contentious it ought to have be do already and if it have not be it should be do very quickly indeed want to end with rebuttal to those who dismiss the issue of islamophobia be talk about those hard of thinking who argue that there would be no islamophobia if only they more like we it be not clear what that mean feel strongly on this and wish to challenge that view by quote something that un secretary general antónio guterres say when mark the first international day to combat islamophobia in he point out that anti muslim bigotry be part of large trend of resurgence in ethno nationalism neo nazism stigma and hate speech target vulnerable population include muslims jews and some minority christian community as well as other he say as the holy quran remind we nation and tribe be create to know one another diversity be richness not threat that mirror what many have say it be intolerance that be the problem not diversity it be incumbent on all of we to challenge intolerance include islamophobia and to do so to be brutally honest whenever we see it call the opposition spokesperson thank my hon friend the member for bradford west naz shah and the hon member for peterborough paul bristow for secure this important debate islamophobia like all form of discrimination serve to divide our community it be grave form of injustice that restrict the ability of muslims or those perceive to be muslims to participate equally and completely in our society islamophobia culminate in violent hate crime target discrimination and structural disparity affect access to employment housing and healthcare and it impede the ability of those affect to go about their daily life our failure to take action to tackle this hatred threaten our democratic principle of fairness and equality and in so doing undermine our social cohesion as whole we see this hatred manifest online on our street and in our public space and at its most extreme in violent act of terror and murder we remember makram ali who be senselessly murder in finsbury park in alongside the attempt murder of nine other that premeditated attack on innocent muslims by far right attacker devastate victim family and entire community we also remember two more grandfather mushin ahmed and mohammed saleem as well as the victim of the christchurch terrorist attack all have their life tragically take from they as result of insidious hatred this serve as terrible reminder of the consequence of islamophobia and the failure to tackle it this debate come at difficult time in the international community the disgusting rise in both islamophobia and antisemitism since the attack on october expose just how real the issue of discrimination be on britain street let start by condemn those brutal attack and the shocking rise in racism that we have see since that day since hamas terrorist attack our country have see disgusting rise in antisemitism with jewish business attack jewish school mark with red paint and jewish family hide who they be we have also see an appalling surge in islamophobia with racist graffiti mosque force to ramp up security and british muslims and palestinians speak to as though they be terrorist while this debate focus on the experience of islamophobia we can not lose sight of the ongoing injustice face by the jewish community in britain do the hon lady agree that one of the most telling point make during the debate be the hon member for coventry south zarah sultana say at the conclusion of her speech that the most effective response to islamophobia and antisemitism be when both community stand by each other in resist both those threat yes my hon friend the member for coventry south zarah sultana make very important point we all need to stand together to ensure that we defeat islamophobia and antisemitism member who have take part in this debate include my hon friend the members for hammersmith andy slaughter for poplar and limehouse apsana begum and for luton north sarah owen my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and my hon friend the members for manchester gorton afzal khan for luton south rachel hopkins for slough mr dhesi and for coventry south all of they have speak about their experience and those of the community in their constituency for some of the member who have speak islamophobia have affect their safety and that of their community one thing they all have in common be that they be clear that we must act to tackle islamophobia and ensure that we take real action and all call on the government to do that year after year british muslims be the victim of the high proportion of religiously motivate hate crime over the past year we have see shocking and rapid rise in incident be report to tell mama as we have hear with case double between and tell mama tireless commitment to tackle islamophobia have ensure that we have detailed database from which it be possible to identify key trend emerge in frequency scope and substance so that we can work to tackle the particular form that islamophobia take that datum show that high profile event act as trigger for steep rise in bigotry both online and at street level as they be weaponise by perpetrator to drive discrimination and violence this week tell mama report that it have record more than case follow the hamas terror attack of october represent sevenfold rise on the same period last year and the large most sustained spike in report to its service across day reporting period behind these number be real people who have be subject to abuse and harm it be vital that we come together in this house to say that islamophobia be not acceptable in any form the labour party stand firmly with the victim of islamophobic hatred and commit to work across our nation to ensure that it be eradicate it be of utmost importance that we recognise the impact of islamophobia on people life and that we recognise the work of grassroot community and religious organisation that have dedicate themselves to tackle it the message from muslim community and organisation be clear that to tackle this bigotry we must be able to identify it yet this government have say that they do not support take forward an official definition of islamophobia follow six month inquiry into the subject the definition propose by the appg on british muslims have be widely recognise and endorse across many section of civil society include among academic muslim community and prominent muslim organisation be proud to say that we have adopt this definition in the labour party and it have also be adopt by the liberal democrats plaid cymru the snp and the scottish conservatives in labour shadow secretary of state for communities and local government the chair of the labour party and the leader of the local government association labour group write to the leader of all labour group in local government to encourage their council to adopt this definition since then hundred of council across the country have take the appg definition on board yet the government have see fit to reject this definition and have since fail to come forward with an alternative definition of their own as they have once promise this dereliction be both substantive and symbolic in its failure to take islamophobia seriously the hon lady will have see that have challenge my government action if she be minister in that position would she commit to appoint an independent adviser on islamophobia straight away as my party have on antisemitism can she confirm that look at the figure for islamophobia anti muslim hatred and antisemitism there will be equal funding to deal with those two unacceptable form of behaviour the hon gentleman make an important point we first need to get the basic right by adopt this definition of islamophobia we be committed to take further step to ensure that islamophobia be stamp out tell mama have document how this racism dehumanise muslims sometimes draw on conspiracy theory to do so it target expression of muslimness or perceive muslimness whether real or imagine and in do so reduce diverse community of people to group identity the power of the appg definition be that it recognise this just like the international holocaust remembrance alliance definition of antisemitism the appg definition be not legally binding instead it be intend to serve as workable yardstick for action against islamophobia we must be able to name and identify islamophobia and that apply as much to the political arena as anywhere else just as high profile event trigger peak in discriminatory behaviour what we say in this house and in our medium have an impact on the abuse that people face online and on our street when the former prime minister the former member for uxbridge and south ruislip refer to muslim woman as letterboxe there be dramatic rise in incident report to tell mama the week follow his comment see the number of incident rise by over that month of street base case directly reference he or language use in his column since then we have continue to hear language in the house that risk endanger ethnic and religious minority we have see the former home secretary refer to pro palestinian march as hate march and the conservative london mayoral candidate engage in islamophobic trope appreciate the hon lady give way but be she plan to react to criticism from labour members on the benches behind she who cite the forde inquiry which state that hierarchy of racism operate in the labour party thank the hon member for that comment and do indeed hear those comment what would say be that within the labour party we be seek to address any issue that relate to islamophobia we must remember that we have choice in this house to empower community or to seek to divide they our word have consequence beyond this chamber it be deeply worry that the normalisation of extremist language from the conservative party have directly coincide with rise in offence be report as political party we must as say take responsibility for identify and tackle islamophobia in our own rank when people ask well what labour do about it the answer be that that be what we be do we have change our party and we be ready to change the country at our party conference in labour pass new independent complaint process to make it fair and easy for people to bring forward case of discrimination we have adopt new code of conduct on islamophobia and we have invest in training staff and publish handbook that will illustrate how our party can challenge islamophobia directly we have commit when in government to tackle structural racial inequality with landmark race equality act we owe it to our muslim community and to community of all faith to do more to protect they from these form of hate the first step in tackle that hate be to identify it so will the minister commit today to adopt the appg definition of islamophobia will she also encourage conservative run local authority to adopt it will she and her colleague work with the police to ensure that victim of islamophobic abuse feel able to report incident and that they be support and keep in the loop throughout the process what step will she take in her own department to understand household and neighbourhood relate case of islamophobic abuse and to work with local authority and muslim community to ensure that such case be handle sensitively finally what effort be the government make to understand and tackle

position want to make it very clear that this government will not tolerate anti muslim hatred in any form and will seek to stamp it out where it occur sadly however as we have hear since the beginning of the conflict between israel and hamas we have witness substantial increase in the number of incident of anti muslim hatred report in britain the government be deeply concerned about the sharp rise in anti muslim hatred which come alongside steep increase in antisemitic incident as well as wide community tension tell mama as many have say have document total of more than anti muslim case as of

levelling up housing and communities and the home secretary have also meet tell mama and muslim expert to hear from they about the challenge arise from the conflict on the anti muslim hatred and islamophobia that the minister describe could she define what that islamophobia be in may one of her ministerial colleague in the department say that they would not accept the appg definition and

security budget for faith community be million in total rise be afraid be not go to take any more intervention have already take one from the hon lady and be conscious that there be another debate to come we remain fully committed to tackle anti muslim hatred head on through co ordinate cross departmental effort work with the home office and obviously with the police we already have some of the strong legislation in the world to tackle hate crime and where group incite racial hatred or be engage in racially or religiously motivate criminal activity we would expect they to be prosecute and to face the full force of the law to help to improve our understanding of hate crime we have be work closely with the police in recent year to improve our datum and we can now disaggregate hate crime by ethnicity and by religion our support for british muslims be reflect by our strong track record of work with international partner to respond to hatred and intolerance and to promote freedom of religion and belief to that end in response to question from an hon member we be proud to have support the united nations general assembly resolution last year establish march as international day to combat islamophobia rise have say that will take no more intervention before finish want to clarify this government position on terminology thank the all party parliamentary group on british muslims and the two co chair the hon member for luton north sarah owen and my hon friend the member for peterborough for the work they have champion to celebrate the contribution of british muslims and to tackle prejudice discrimination and hatred against muslims in the uk however want to make it clear that this government do not accept that particular definition of islamophobia the definition propose by the appg be not in line with the equality act which define race in term of colour nationality and national or ethnic origin the propose definition could also unintentionally undermine freedom of speech the term anti muslim hatred be more precise and well reflect uk hate crime legislation let put it in simple term free speech entitle people to express view on religion or ideology but they must not hate or discriminate against someone because of their religion that be why we think that anti muslim hatred be more appropriate term have be ask about the government future step be glad to say that we be undertake broad and extensive engagement on religious hatred against all community we be consider all issue as part of that include definition we know that british muslims feel especially vulnerable at this time hope it be crystal clear through the many initiative that have outline that this government will always stand up for british muslims they be an integral part of our proudly plural multi faith multi ethnic united kingdom we have say loud and clear that anti muslim hatred have no place in british society and we will not allow the scourge of religious hatred to manifest in any shape or form during debate such as these often reflect on the wisdom of the former member for batley and spen jo cox when she remark we be far more united and have far more in common than that which divide we official report june vol this government be commit to ensure that the value of diversity tolerance and compassion extend to all our community there we have it thank everyone who have speak in the debate but the government policy and response to tackle islamophobia be we pick and choose who we invite to no for tea and samosa but no policy and we will not accept your definition as you muslims decide to define it base on your experience of discrimination no we do accept it because we be the government and when it come to you muslims we will apply not the liberal democratic principle that we apply to the rest of the country but totalitarian approach that be the government response to tackle islamophobia well do what be expect dare imagine government who would not miss another opportunity to put policy in place to tackle islamophobia no just long list of opportunity miss by this government and this prime minister who stand with the british muslim community no not unless they fit the government criterion if it walk like duck quack like duck and swim like duck it be duck if it feel like gaslighte and sound like gaslighte as muslim and representative of large muslim constituency of bradford let tell the government it be gaslighte that be what we have have from those on the government benches today what shame that they do not uphold the british value that bring we here the british value of equality fairness justice and treat people equally the government be say let treat you muslims differently we be not go to give you definition of islamophobia and we do not want you to have say on what it feel like to experience islamophobia we will just call it anti muslim hatred the hon member for gillingham and rainham rehman chishti be right to say that the prime minister be not just gaslighte but have create hierarchy of racism he do not treat islamophobia as equal and it dishearten will just wait for the next general election and let people vote with their foot by choose the party that stand for equality justice and fairness it certainly ai the tories question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the matter of tackle islamophobia beneficial ownership registers overseas territories and crown dependencies beg to move that this house note the implementation of public register of beneficial ownership in the uk overseas territories and crown dependencies believe that the government need to respect the will of parliament and meet the implementation deadline at the end of encourage the government to lay an order in council formally require the uk overseas territories to implement public register of beneficial ownership if the deadline be not meet and consider public register of beneficial ownership to be an essential transparency measure to combat tax evasion money laundering and other economic crime this debate should not be necessary the house express its view when it agree an amendment to the sanctions and anti money laundering act that require overseas territory to voluntarily introduce register of beneficial ownership within two year or face an order in council mandate compliance five year have pass since the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell and move the amendment and the only overseas territory to comply with the legislation be gibraltar which salute while understand that the minister be make progress with some of the other jurisdiction they have yet to comply with our legislation journalist have reveal that the family of asif aziz landlord to my constituent in britannia point colliers wood manage large property portfolio register under dozen of company on the isle of man there be no beneficial owner list so complaint can never reach the landlord we already have legislation that require offshore company that own property to declare their owner on register do my right hon friend agree that properly resource enforcement be essential and that have public register of beneficial owner would make it much easy to identify and scrutinise the beneficial owner of offshore shell company be grateful to my hon friend for bring that to our attention sadly it be an issue not just of enforcement but of definition bet that the landlord in her constituency own the property through trust and there be no openness about beneficial ownership of trust she make very important point apologise for not be able to stay for the whole debate strongly support this debate put it to the right hon lady that the reason why people hide thing in trust and offshore be either to avoid embarrassment or to avoid tax people ought to do well so that they will not be embarrassed and they ought to pay tax properly thank the hon member for his support agree that it be partly about reputation and partly about avoid tax but it be also about indulge in economic crime from money launder through to the bad crime that stain our country and our economy as the father of the house have just intervene and be the long serve member on the opposition side of the house may say that be long term supporter of what my right hon friend have be try to do owe to our time together as undergraduate at the london school of economics know that she be determined woman let we get on with it let we hold these people to account and change the law thank my hon friend for his support he be probably my old friend in the house we go back many year and hope that the government hear his urging could we add one more to the list of reason why people conceal their identity in this way which be to avoid sanction include sanction place by our own government the right hon member make really important point which will come to later he be right this be national security threat as well as threat to our economy the government have yet to comply with the legislation by make an order in council to mandate compliance by the overseas territory after discussion between the crown dependency and the right hon member for sutton coldfield and myself the three crown dependency jersey guernsey and the isle of man announce in may that they be committed to introduce public register and set out plan to do so although welcome that in principle be concern that their commitment be qualified and that their action plan contain number of opt out clause however on the basis of their commitment we choose not to legislate but to trust they it now seem that our trust be misplace they be renege on that commitment and use every excuse not to comply understand how strongly the right hon member feel may point out that as matter of constitutional fact we have no right to legislate for any of the crown dependency constitutionally they be not subject to the jurisdiction of this parliament have enormous respect and time for the hon member but have an opinion from renowned kc that we seek at that time will come to it later which contradict entirely his point and say that we do have the constitutional right to legislate want to comment not on the substance of what the right hon lady be talk about but merely on the procedural aspect she will know that the procedure committee be look at the impact of legislation in this place on devolved legislature the overseas territory and the crown dependency and be interested in her comment and look forward to her speech but do she agree that we should try to find way for the voice of the overseas territory to be hear when we legislate in this place if there be implication for they indeed would love for we to be able to do this in consensual way that would obviously be the good way to proceed sadly we have be wait for year and my patience have wear little thin give the implication both for national security and for the economy the time have come to say enough be enough we should use the power that we have the right hon member be be generous with her time the ruling of the court of justice of the european union state that unrestricted public access to beneficial ownership information be incompatible with the right to life will she cover that will the hon member will know as well as do that we be no long member of the european union so we be not bind by that finding why do all this matter the epidemic of tax avoidance tax evasion and economic crime flourish in an environment of secrecy and our overseas territory and crown dependency facilitate that secrecy we know from the ever grow number of leak of datum on financial misdemeanour that their role be central to enable economic crime half the shell company expose in the panama paper be incorporate in the british virgin islands in the paradise paper massive tranche of document leak from the offshore law firm appleby show that frightening number of frontline politician hold secret account with the overseas territory appear prominently as destination of choice for hide money those include people such as justin trudeau chief fundraiser donald trump commerce secretary brazil finance minister uganda foreign minister and our own lord ashcroft who have and probably still have bermuda base trust where he hide some of his wealth some of the file in the fincen financial crimes enforcement network leak of contain client that list an address in the british virgin islands the leak also reveal because it be leak of document from an american agency that the americans view britain as high risk jurisdiction for its role in money laundering and financial crime the pandora paper leak of involve million file with datum from different law firm and company service provider over two third of the company analyse in that batch of leak document be register in the bvi world bank review of corruption case that be investigate over the year period to find that involve anonymous shell company the uk its overseas territory and crown dependency account for the second jurisdiction in term of the number of corruption case associate with it what be learn from my right hon friend excellent speech be that london be the centre of the world for hide money because so many professional in this city know how to do it be that correct yes sadly london have become the jurisdiction of choice for too much of our dirty money the all party parliamentary group on anti corruption and responsible tax have be successful albeit not as much as would have like in achieve change to economic crime legislation to challenge and start tackle that congratulate my right hon friend on lead the debate and more particularly on the forensic and persistent way she have deal with this issue over so many year it be clear that london be the centre of much of the wrongdoing in this area that be not coincidence it be because the government have be permissive have she have an indication of whether they be now prepared to back her proposal my hon friend be right have often say that it be not just this government who have do that the labour government in their time also deregulate to such an extent that they allow london to become the centre of this activity do not feel that the government be do all that they can to try to turn that around await future labour government and will watch labour ministers with an eagle eye to ensure that they do that the debate be not just about the role of the overseas territory and crown dependency in facilitate economic crime their activity as secrecy jurisdiction be threat to our national security as the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis say the foreign affairs committee say as much in report on the matter and as recently as november it call on the government to ensure that the overseas territory fulfil their commitment add that there should be no further deadline extension we know for example that between and billion flow out of russia and into our overseas territory we be favourite jurisdiction for receive russian launder money we know that individual who be sanction use the overseas territory and crown dependencie to hide their asset just before sanction to prevent those asset from be frozen abramovich and usmanov be two classic example of that practice we know the role of the overseas territory in prevent we from know the actual beneficial owner of property in the uk over of the property in the list of those that we know about be own by company register either in the crown dependency or the bvi we still can not identify the beneficial owner of two third of those because they use trust to hide their identity and than eight out of of those trust arrangement be base in the three crown dependency and the bvi most recently in the cyprus paper which have just be uncover we find direct link between vladimir putin and roman abramovich with money go from abramovich to two man dub as wallet for putin man whose salary be but whose wealth be rumour to be between billion and billion the theft of money from the russian people be facilitate by secrecy jurisdiction such as cyprus but also by our own tax haven the problem be massive and the role of our overseas territory and crown dependency be central baron cameron of chipping norton understand that when he go to davos in january over year ago and warn multinational to wake up and smell the coffee will give few more quote from he in he pledge every one of the crown dependencies and overseas territories be go to have an action plan on beneficial ownership he tell the overseas territory to rip aside the cloak of secrecy by create public register of beneficial ownership in he write to the overseas territory say that public register be vital to meet the urgent challenge of illicit finance and tax evasion in september he accuse they of frankly not move anywhere near fast enough if we want to break the business model of people steal money and hide it in place where it can be see transparency be the answer when lord cameron launch our uk register in he say that it well for we all to have an open system which everyone have access to because the more eye that look at this information the more accurate it will be at the anti corruption summit in may he say we ve talk about the need for every country to ultimately reach what call the gold standard of have public register of beneficial ownership and be clear that include all the overseas territories and crown dependencies lord cameron be now in position to act and urge the minister to tell his boss to do so when even nigeria ukraine albania and morocco have introduce public register why can our tax haven not use the european court of justice rule to delay the implementation of public register be convenient but lame excuse it actually have not deter gibraltar while some country have close their register other have keep they open crown dependency in particular be act in completely dishonourable way their role in facilitate economic crime and tax avoidance be indisputable and their protestation to the contrary be simply untrue their behaviour in provide public assurance that they will move towards public register but claim that the european court ruling prevent they from do so be in my view unforgivable my right hon friend be be generous in give way absolutely support everything that she be say but can we also have more publicity about what be happen with people who do not pay tax in this country jim ratcliffe of ineos have become very rich and now do not pay tax in this country understand that the daily mail do not pay any taxis could we not have an ad in the sunday times rich list about those who actually pay their taxis be leave wonder whether the sunday times would ever publish that we shall see let address the point make by the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill in april the right hon member for sutton coldfield and seek legal advice about whether it would be constitutionally lawful for the uk parliament to legislate to compel all crown dependency to establish public register of beneficial ownership have the advice here which conclude it be beyond doubt that the intrusion of criminal fund into the uk economy threaten the interest of the uk it be also beyond doubt that extensive fund in this category emanate from the crown dependency the last sentence state the propose put an amendment to the king counsel to consider whether it be lawful be constitutionally legitimate and lawful exercise of the uk power to secure its domestic interest by protect confidence in its financial institution and the integrity of the commercial life of the nation finally recognise that we be run out of time want to touch on the compromise that think the minister be seek to secure in his negotiation with our tax haven the compromise be that in order to have access member of the public need to have legitimate interest term that be introduce in the european union sixth anti money laundering directive we already have that proviso in relation to the register of overseas property and draw to the minister attention the fact that transparency international have put in inquiry in six case to get information have wait for four to six month and have then see those request for information turn down by his majesty revenue and customs all of those request be in relation to trust list as the beneficial owner of overseas company that hold property here in the uk and we would have expect they to be on that register and for the information to be provide surely every single citizen of this country have legitimate interest in close the kind of loophole that have allow rotten dirty money to come flood into our jurisdiction do my right hon friend agree that it have have huge detrimental effect on ordinary people who do not have trust fund and be unlikely to inherit anything such as the huge increase in property price that have force many people out of the housing market my hon friend make an important point those who suffer the most be the poor in our community one must remember that no tax be levy on all this illicit finance so it do not fund the public service that we require would also point out to the minister that legitimate interest proviso do not meet the requirement of the sanctions and anti money laundering act the term of the draft order in council specifically say that we want compliant publicly accessible register ask the minister to think about that sunlight be the good disinfectant we all know that if we be serious about our effect to clamp down on dirty money and eliminate it from britain and from our overseas territory and crown dependency we must have public register so that we can at the very least start to follow the money for the sake of people who might not be expert in this field can the right hon lady explain the extent to which those crown dependency and overseas territory themselves know where the real ownership of the resource reside can we be sure that they themselves know what information be be conceal and ought to be make public or that we will have get to the bottom of the matter if it be make public be not sure can answer that because do not know whether they know but there have be one or two instance where whistleblower have come to see about jersey for example it have be very difficult to find out and identify how much the jersey authority know and why or whether they take action on the information that be available it would be wonderful if the right hon gentleman committee could look at this issue in great detail to establish that illicit finance be not just an evil in itself it be the golden thread that run through all serious crime from drug smuggling to people smuggle it threaten our national security hit the poor country the hard and starve our public service of much need investment it be in recognition of that importance that we establish the strong cross party consensus in the house that lead to the law which be agree unanimously in this house ten year have pass since david cameron first openly support public register and five year have pass since we legislate but we be still wait that be not good enough it be the job of the executive to implement the will of parliament to that end ask the minister to take two action first will he now lay an order in council require the overseas territory to introduce public register of beneficial ownership forthwith secondly will he legislate to require crown dependency to do the same if the government do not act can assure he that parliament will for we must for the sake of our economy for the sake of our security and for the sake of our reputation urge the government to move forward on this issue five people have indicate that they wish to speak and the wind up will begin at that mean eight minute for richard thomson minute each for stephen doughty and mr rutley and two minute for margaret hodge to wind up if people stick to five minute everybody will get equal time it be pleasure to see the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge in her place and congratulate she on secure this debate she and have agree on many issue and have work together closely in the past happen to support the concept of public register of beneficial ownership in the united kingdom and support it when it be first introduce declare my interest as chair of the gibraltar all party parliamentary group as the right hon lady have observe gibraltar have establish public register of beneficial ownership it be right therefore that we should not treat all the overseas territory as homogenous in one respect gibraltar with its particular link both to the united kingdom and europe have choose to go in that direction and we should support it in have do so that be its decision as self govern overseas territory it have continue to do that even though it must be observe and we should not make light of this fact that the ruling of the european court of justice have now mean that some of the eu state have close their register we should be careful about dismiss that it do not apply to we anymore because we have leave the european union but we should not dismiss that fact and simply pooh pooh it because it have an impact on other gibraltar choose despite that to continue with its register that bring we to the position of the crown dependency refer to this matter of course as chair of the justice committee we have to remember that the constitutional position of the crown dependency be totally different from that of the overseas territory they be not part of the united kingdom and never have be say that with due respect to any legal opinion that can be produce frankly though one legal opinion count for very little against century of constitutional convention and the view of successive british government of all party the simple fact be that the crown dependency have never be subject to this parliament they be not represent in this parliament they have their own legislature which be sovereign in those matter we should not allow good intention to lead we into arrogance as an institution and purport to legislate in area where we have no right happen to think that if be in one of those legislature might well be make the case for broaden out their register but it be not for we to presume to do so there have be some progress as select committee we take some evidence from the crown dependency in our role of scrutinise the ministry of justice which handle the relationship it be not the foreign office that do so be delighted to see the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for finchley and golders green mike freer in his place he have establish very constructive relationship with the crown dependency what we have be this the crown dependency have choose at the moment not to go down the route that we have go down if we want they to go down that route we must persuade they to do so of their own volition as sovereign independent country that may well be where they get to at the end of the day there have be some movement as matter of fact be they here they would say that they do have central fully compliant authorised and accurate register of beneficial ownership they be not open to the public as of yet but they do meet international standard they be subject to the moneyval monitoring process of the european union and they comply with all the international standard we have choose to go far than those standard but they have go as far as that secondly all three of they in lockstep on national interest matter and money laundering transpose into their domestic law all the sanction that we have bring in as the uk in relation to russia and it be no good pretend otherwise the national security argument be therefore frankly rather thin one there be well argument to make such as good practice none the less they tell we when they give evidence to the committee that there have be an intention to move towards great degree of openness in their register they have take the view and it be their choice at the moment on their legal advice their legal system be as good in their sphere as ours be in our that they wish to take stock of the decision of the european court of justice and the impact it may have on they not least because they have data adequacy agreement with the eu when they read the detailed decision of the ecj as have the crown dependency find difficulty in both disproportionality between general public access and right to privacy those right under the charter of fundamental right might observe mirror exactly those in the european convention on human right which as it happen bind we still and in relation to data protection they be concern about potential risk to their data protection equivalence with the eu let we hope that we be able to find way in which we can all agree sensible step forward as understand it the crown dependency be commit to make an announcement later this month that they will be extend their work far they be look first of all at oblige entity people who need to carry out due diligence and then at the concept of legitimate interest that be step forward let we perhaps wait and see what they say we will get more progress with our crown dependency friend by co operation and discussion than we will with respect by lecture thank my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge for secure this debate and for her consistent and tireless work in tackle the scourge of illicit finance as she say the introduction of public register of beneficial ownership in our country offshore financial centre ought not to need debating and it should have happen many year ago yesterday after seven long year the hillsborough family finally get response from the government to bishop jones report yet it be response that reject his key recommendation this government have be even more tardy when it come to deliver on their declare policy of public register of beneficial ownership it have be almost year since the prime minister lord cameron call on our overseas territory and dependency to raise their transparency standard and not lot have happen as we have hear after five year amendment be make to what become the sanctions and anti money laundering act require territory and dependency to act by that time the prime minister have gamble and lose the brexit referendum and he have leave office leave parliament and get embroil in the dubious activity of lex greensill and still nothing have change the case for transparency be clear and unarguable and the fight against crime and corruption require it but we be still no far forward lord cameron have return to parliament in new guise as foreign secretary hope he will once more be directly responsible for policy in this area and hope he will be able to help we make some real and meaningful progress the public disclosure of company ownership information would facilitate the trailing of money and identity and illicit activity and deter money laundering crime and sanction bust and it be essential that we make progress labour have repeatedly try to push the government to act both last year and this year my hon friend the member for aberavon stephen kinnock move amendment to the economic crime and corporate transparency bill which would have require the government to lay an order in council and to make some progress but the government defeat they they continue to say they be do thing while achieve no real outcome that make difference the facilitating of illicit finance through our overseas territory and crown dependency pose serious threat in number of way as my right hon friend the member for barking say it deprive the public purse of fund and it prevent true economic stability it pose very real threat to our national security and it affect each and every citizen of this country be it in underfunded public service high than expect property price illicit crime or organised crime in our community all of that affect each and every one of the constituent of members up and down the country the financial cost of global tax evasion enable by lack of transparency in our territory and dependency be staggering to contemplate tax justice find that of global tax loss suffer by country around the world occur in the uk and its network of overseas territory and crown dependency that be shameful statistic the lack of transparency in offshore jurisdiction facilitate myriad other illicit activity at great cost to our country company base in overseas territory have enable corruption case to the tune of billion notably an astonishing of those be register in the british virgin islands for context billion be more than the whole of the uk foreign aid budget for the past year that money be go unaccounted for when it could be work for our community with war rag in europe and the middle east and contemplate the revelation the house hear early about organise attempt by the russian fsb to interfere in uk election it be clear that the threat be grow the cross party foreign affairs committee have rightfully call for public register as matter of national security increasingly believe that the risk to the uk international reputation be grow our reputation have already be substantially damage it be in the public interest for the minister to tell we what he be go to do as matter of urgency to deal with this grow threat thank the backbench business committee for grant time for the debate and congratulate the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge on secure it as member will know there be many function of beneficial ownership both licit and illicit regardless of the legality of the arrangement it go without say that public register of these beneficial ownership would play vital role in combat tax evasion and other such unlawful activity we can all agree with that it be the desire of everyone in this house and of the government of the overseas territory that we work towards well transparency to ensure these island and territory be no long associate with be tax haven and hotbed of illegal financial activity place include the overseas territory do not want to be consider as such when people from those place travel their experience be cloud by comment they receive from other about how they harbour terrorist money or be all money launderer that be simply unfair many of the territory have already demonstrate progress in the fight against money laundering and tax evasion none more so than the cayman islands people may know that have some link with the cayman islands do not have bank account there but have many friend there and have be involve in environmental matter in the country the cayman government take the fight against illicit finance very seriously in they be among eight territory commit to introduce publicly accessible register by the end of the year progress have be make draft proposal be initially publish in and consultation begin shortly after aside from the implementation of the register the cayman islands have make great stride in navigate the complex intersection of transparency governance and international standard and it be worth bring those to light so that they may serve as an example for other oversea territory and crown dependency and provide member with some hope that they be play their part for example the cayman islands operate tax co operation agreement with over country include participation in the us foreign account tax compliance act the cayman islands follow the common reporting standard global standard set by the oecd and advocate by the nation the progress make by the cayman islands have be recognise by the financial action taskforce which confirm that its anti money laundering regime effectively deter and prosecute financial crime in the territory and by his majesty government for effective implementation of its russian sanction taskforce operation hektor know that russian finance be of particular concern to many member it be worth note that operation hektor have so involve the deregistration of more than vessel and aircraft and the freezing of account worth approximately billion and million that go to show that there be many effective way in which the overseas territory can tackle illicit finance operate in their jurisdiction back in ministers be clear that the introduction of comprehensive public register would be considerable ask for many overseas territory particularly those that do not possess any exist company beneficial ownership register it be worth point out that the cayman islands have since maintain an electronic register of beneficial ownership information for all corporate and legal entity any such arrangement in the island be verify and update by authorise corporate service provider which then pass on the information to uk law enforcement within hour under the exchange of note agreement establish in that say complexity arise with the proviso that public accessibility be at an accept international standard particularly among eu member state as member be aware and as my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill mention the ruling of the court of justice of the european union state that unrestricted public access to beneficial ownership information be incompatible with the right to private life we may not be in the european union any more but the sentiment of many of those ruling remain know that follow that ruling many territory seek legal and constitutional advice on the impact perhaps the minister could provide his own assessment of the ruling and tell we how he be work with territory to counteract it and ensure the smooth transition to public register know that government of the overseas territory and dependency will be listen closely to this debate have no doubt of their commitment to provide the transparency need also trust that many member present and the government will appreciate the work that have already be undertake will call marie rimmer and then meg hillier you must sit down by half past so perhaps you can divide the time between you thank my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge for secure the debate our country with its crown dependency and overseas territory be responsible for of global tax loss the uk tax gap be estimate by his majesty revenue and customs to be worth billion those billion of pound could be spend help our nhs or fix our school leak roof but sadly they be instead prop up putin and his crony as they try to destroy ukraine the past year have put spotlight on dirty money launder and hide here yet that problem have be around for year we must act now to ensure that we be not indirectly responsible for horror continue to occur by fail to tackle dirty money be it in london the british virgin islands or one of our other territory we have duty to the people of ukraine to do our bit we have hear many time from the dispatch box about how much support we be rightly give to ukraine but the government must press our crown dependency and overseas territory which be the russians laundromat of choice to do the same transparency international have identify case of corruption enable by company base in the overseas territory those case be worth an astonishing billion which be divert via rig procurement bribery embezzlement and the unlawful acquisition of state asset all those case pass through company register in our overseas territory the presidential family of the republic of congo have enrich themselves to the sum of at least million by complete dodgy oil deal through company base in anguilla all while the congo sit in billion of pound of debt of all the case of those be register in the british virgin islands the scale of the financial damage cause by those company be billion which be great than the uk foreign aid budget over the past year we in this house often talk about our responsibility to the world and to mankind and about our duty to help the world poor that be why we believe in foreign aid yet monumental sum be be rob from country around the world by despot and dictator and then store in our territory our duty to the world require we to do more to crack down on it quite frankly every time there be series of leak from the panama paper and the paradise papers to the cyprus confidential dossier it be an embarrassment to our country and it be not go away as have be set out one of the most effective way to crack down on the problem be with public register of who own the company in our overseas territory and crown dependency there have be enough talk about crack down on tax avoidance for decade it be now time for realistic and pragmatic action for good fraud tax and sanction avoidance and other economic crime can be crack down on only if it be possible to follow the money the government can not expect law enforcement to crack down on tax avoidance if it be not give the tool it need to do it we can do it and we have say we will do it so we should get on and do it public register can also help to restore public faith in the tax system by help to expose the high level of aggressive tax avoidance and evasion that we know take place in the long term public register can contribute to create fair and less lopsided tax system that allow the government of the day to collect tax effectively and fairly invest in our public service and infrastructure public register of beneficial ownership be sensible transparency measure with broad cross party support the government have repeatedly express their support for establish public register but we be still wait for they to be set up they be suppose to be set up by the end of this situation can not go on the foreign secretary need to get this over the line we need to be able to identify who the true owner of offshore wealth be we need to be able to uphold the law and make sure that tax be pay we need to remove the veil of secrecy that sadly exist in too many of our territory and dependency it be pleasure to follow the passion of my hon friend the member for st helens south and whiston ms rimmer have be on this journey with my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge since serve on the public accounts committee when she be chair it shockingly it be now year on from that we begin to deal with some of the domestic issue with company that have international footprint the large company such as starbucks which we have before the committee remember that rollercoaster ride and my right hon friend should be congratulate on that work let we be clear what the impact of the lack of beneficial ownership register be other have touch on security but wish to talk about the tax that be lose we be in cost of living crisis there be huge pressure on the exchequer and we have an election loom with each party that be likely to be in government want to make promise to the electorate this money be be hide away without people know where it be and that be definitely have an impact on the tax take it be an absolute opportunity for tax avoidance and tax evasion in particular and it be key that we have this register in my constituency lot of property be own by offshore company some of they in the overseas territory and it be impossible for the resident of those building to know who their landlord truly be they face an address with no name attach and no response come from those landlord it be against natural justice for people who have their home own by other as finance vehicle not to be able to have access to they we need to make sure that this issue be deal with because if we do not deal with the issue of money laundering and economic crime across the piece and we deal with they only domestically without strategy for the overseas territory and crown dependency there be risk that the problem will simply move rather than be resolve people with money and advice about where to hide it if they be minded to hide it will find way to do that where those way exist this loophole need to be close and we have prime opportunity with the foreign secretary the very person who as prime minister be back that decade ago now sit in the house of lords and at the cabinet table he could be drive this so urge the minister to speak up for his new boss hope that the minister have be give the go ahead to give we some comfort today that this issue will finally be revolve there be only few week until the end of the year and hope he can give we some comfort on the timeline thank you for your co operation for the first wind up call richard thomson let begin by share the disappointment of the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge that this debate be necessary at all it be incredibly disappointing that the target the uk government have of ensure that by december the month we be in public register be set up for the overseas territory and crown dependency look set to be miss this debate ought to start as in fairness it have from fundamental premise public register of beneficial ownership be vital tool in help to identify and therefore reduce financial crime and to increase financial transparency the simple fact of know who own what who benefit from it and where the money have flow from and be flow to all help to identify and tackle crime of all sort include corruption drug trafficking and people traffic as well as domestic and international tax evasion and tax avoidance be able to get this under control would be massively to our collective benefit and not just from reputational point of view because the revenue money and asset that be conceal in this way can be use to fund activity that be detrimental to national security it would also be massively to the benefit of the rest of the world to close down option for kleptocratic businesspeople or politician to strip asset from their country and squirrel they away in untransparent jurisdiction to enrich their lifestyle that be clearly not good thing and the people of those country suffer as consequence of that permissive environment register be necessary but insufficient step and there be lot of work to be do not just on this issue we have hear about london unenviable reputation as the laundromat think that term be use for some of the world dirty money remember participate in debate early in my parliamentary career about similar issue that be cause by london be the laundromat for reputational issue through the prevalence of libel tourism the ability to use slapp strategic lawsuit against public participation and the prevalence of public affair and public relation agency that be willing to accept money to do such thing there be much work to be do to clean up the united kingdom act in that sense although the uk government introduce register of beneficial ownership in and have encourage the crown dependency and overseas territory to follow suit they have not do that so far at least despite voluntarily agree to do so that be despite the uk government use the sweet persuasion of publish draft order in council as long ago as in to require they to do so and give they deadline of this month which now seem almost certain to be miss this be the fundamental point if the uk wish to seek leadership on this issue it can not be take seriously as world leader on financial transparency if it do not do more and be not see to do more to stop overseas territory be use as haven for individual to evade their obligation it matter very much that that should happen more than half of the shell company expose in the panama paper be incorporate in uk tax haven more than two third of the company analyse by the international consortium of investigative journalists from the panama paper leak be find to be register in the british virgin islands the uk and its overseas jurisdiction be collectively responsible through that permissiveness for cost the rest of the world nearly billion in lose tax each year by enable non resident to hide their finance and avoid tax as the hon member for wallasey dame angela eagle highlight tax justice uk estimate that the uk and its network of overseas territory and crown dependency be responsible for some of global tax loss suffer by country around the world the impact that clamp down on this problem could have not just on the public good for the uk but in many other country around the world be highly significant we be often invite to believe that the big threat to our quality of excuse interruption thank you very much thank mr doughty for provide cup of water in the spirit of the lib lab pact lib well it show that there be perhaps future for progressive alliance of one kind or another mr deputy speaker maybe on cup of water yes we be regularly invite to believe that the great threat to our public service and our quality of life come not from lack of resource but from immigration indeed the govern party be tear itself to bit today over the difficulty that it have set itself in pursuit of the vote of those they believe might be influence by such sentiment can not help but feel that we would be in significantly well place if only the government put half the effort into clamp down on the opportunity for tax avoidance evasion and lack of transparency as they put into tell we that there be problem about boat the three country that rank high in the corporate tax haven index compile by the tax justice network be the british virgin islands the cayman islands and bermuda which be not an accolade to be proud of where score of be the most permissive system and zero be the least permissive the uk itself score less than clever greece score but seven of the eight territory that score perfect use the word perfect advisedly be british overseas territory or crown dependency the uk government and the territory governments hold joint ministerial council in november but there have be no statement will the minister update the house on the progress that have be make how will that affect the december deadline in the foreign secretary who be then prime minister make number of stride forward in address this issue we on the opposition benches be struggle with many thing include my voice but we can see the benefit that come from lord cameron appointment on these matter we very much hope that he be able to pick up where he leave off when he demit office as prime minister if not the clock certainly my voice be tell that it be probably time to wind thing up do the hon gentleman agree that ensure we have open and transparent register of beneficial ownership be only the first step in deal with what be very well establish very difficult and grow threat in short yes do the register be necessary although they be not sufficient by themselves clearly great deal more work need to be do commend the right hon member for barking for her clarity and leadership

offord the chair of the justice committee the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill also make important point on the constitutional position of the crown dependency be no expert on the different legal opinion that have be express on that matter but have certainly have it put to clearly by representative of the crown dependency as labour shadow minister for the uk overseas territory want to begin by reiterate our unwavering commitment to each member of our global british family their sovereignty and their right to self determination we be committed to respectful but candid productive but principled partnership between the uk and each territory and the same be true in many respect of the crown dependency it be pleasure to meet the premier chief ministers and representative of each overseas territory early this month during the week of the joint ministerial council and to hear their insight concern and perspective on issue from security to sovereignty climate change to infrastructure and constitutional relationship to this very issue of financial service and beneficial ownership as have say in previous debate we need to be careful that we do not pursue misconception about the overseas territory and crown dependency each territory and dependency be distinctive and unique many of the overseas territory do not engage in financial service and this debate apply less to they we must also recognise that step have be take and that there have be progress in some area indeed reference be make to the public register of beneficial ownership in gibraltar to the exchange of note agreement which have exist since and to number of other step that have be take also want to acknowledge have discuss this with they over the last two year that number of the overseas territory and indeed crown dependency have be integral to effort on freeze russian state and other asset since the onset of putin illegal and barbarous war in ukraine however labour believe that be part of the british family come with clear responsibility we share common value obligation and principle include robust commitment to democracy the rule of law and liberty and the protection of human right we also believe in the advancement of good governance and in ensure proper democratic accountability and regulation which of course include transparency in financial service the foreign affairs committee report be refer to and note the comment in it and comment make today about the interdependence between proper regulation and transparency and our wide national security and foreign policy objective that be why we must respond to the call make by my right hon friend the member for barking and many other today for we to tackle these issue by urgently bring about the full implementation of public register of beneficial ownership in the uk overseas territory and hope crown dependencie sadly action on economic crime have be hold back by year of conservative delay and dither as have be reference we be first promise register of overseas ownership by lord cameron in and it beggar belief that we be still debate how it should be implement section of the sanctions and anti money laundering act require the secretary of state no later than december to prepare draft order in council require the government of any british overseas territory that have not introduce publicly accessible register of the beneficial ownership of company within its jurisdiction to do so yet here we be in we should also remember the economic crime transparency and enforcement act which be pass as emergency legislation in the light of the situation in ukraine and the need to sanction russian state entity and other involve in the invasion its primary purpose include set up register of overseas entity and their beneficial owner and require overseas entity that own land in the uk to register in certain circumstance we have repeatedly be clear that overseas entity should not be able to hide behind trust and it be important to explain why that matter recent article by advani poux and summers from the london school of economics tell we that per cent of case where beneficial ownership be not publicly report involve the use of trust it also state the crown dependencies and overseas territories be heavily implicate here over per cent of all trust arrangement come from jersey per cent guernsey per cent british virgin islands per cent and isle of man per cent russia invasion of ukraine only highlight why we need to see who own what and in way that be transparent and publicly available we have make clear time and again the need to bring forward much need reform to companies house alongside review of the register of overseas entity to ensure that the right balance be strike between privacy and the public interest include our ability for example to apply sanction effectively here in the uk be afraid we have be play game of catch up we need to move forward in that respect work co operatively with the overseas territory and the crown dependency but take action if it have not yet be forthcoming the view of the british public be clear the result of poll for the uk anti corruption coalition show that of the british public believe that the government should take more responsibility work with offshore financial centre to tackle money laundering and tax evasion that will require the opening up of corporate registry to public scrutiny and for the end of year deadline to be meet as matter of priority we be see as never before confluence of the need to ensure good governance across financial centre and our own national security let ask the minister some question first will the deadline be meet yes or no if not what do the fcdo and the wide government consider to be reasonable deadline and what will be do to meet it can he clarify the position in relation to the crown dependency in particular give the comment that have be make today obviously have see the statement that they have make about come forward with public commitment think that be the phrase in relation to their approach to access to information on register of beneficial ownership by the end of december to replace the commitment be pleased to read the joint ministerial council communiqué which say that the overseas territories and the uk will be establish technical working group on beneficial ownership and the implementation of publicly accessible register what be happen about that and what support be be give to small territory in particular to enable they to make progress what be the group do and how will it move forward and actually deliver result after the november jmc the minister pledge that he would report to parliament before the recess on the progress toward the deadline be today that day and can he provide precise timeline could he also provide an update on the status of the draft order in council and the circumstance in which it would be invoke will he tell we what percentage of business cover by the exchange of note agreement be be cover now understand that in it be be it now as promise at what speed be the information be exchange the cayman islands have tell we that it do it within hour be that timeline the same in every single territory hope that the minister can answer those question today we want to see progress as matter of urgency as part of respectful constructive but principled relationship with our overseas territory and crown dependency if the minister can sit down by about two minute to that will allow dame margaret hodge to sum up the debate it be an honour to serve with you in the chair mr deputy speaker have not have chance to say this in person until now but thank you for your christmas card we know that christmas be come and it be always joy be particularly grateful to the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge for secure the debate pay tribute to she for her work as chair of the all

serious contribution and do not say that lightly the calculation be make by one of my colleague be also grateful for the presence of the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for finchley and golders green mike freer who be probably soon to be right hon or something what with all the stuff that be go on he lead on the crown dependency in the ministry of justice and take keen interest in the issue affect they and the overseas territory another of the dame be also present on the front bench my right hon friend the member for cannock chase dame amanda milling very well respect former overseas territory minister illicit finance be an active and grow threat to the national security of the uk family there we have it it have be say on both side of the house be not sure we need to say much more on that particular point but it be serious as set out early this year in the uk second economic crime plan illicit finance fuel serious and organised crime threaten our institution and enable kleptocrat to establish financial foothold recognise the important work of my noble friend the foreign secretary just to reassure the right hon member for barking can feel the strength of his opinion on my shoulder right now that also go for my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell who be the development minister and minister for africa and my right hon friend the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat who be the security minister think they be well known to the right hon lady and the strength of their opinion be know to she and the house and to many other too this be an important and serious debate the uk overseas territory and crown dependency have history of work together as partner to strengthen our economic defence against illicit finance publicly accessible register of beneficial ownership be an essential tool in that fight we want great transparency and we be work hard to deliver it as have be say the uk implement our own register in the first of its kind in the world the sanctions and anti money laundering act set out parliament desire for the overseas territory to introduce register and in response all the inhabit territory and crown dependency make public commitment to do so the uk welcome those commitment as demonstration of our joint desire to meet the high standard in tackle illicit finance in we set out in write ministerial statement our expectation that the territory and dependency would implement register by the end of this year and include draft order in council we then provide technical assistance and support and we see ot make significant progress for instance bvi be able to pass appropriate primary legislation in and the cayman islands in and the cd have also take set of preparatory bless you it could be catch it will not have escape member notice that only gibraltar currently have an operational register as be highlight by my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill the chair of the justice committee the other thing be that as those who be follow the calendar have note there be only three week to go until the end of let be absolutely clear this be not where the uk government want the ot and cd to be in november last year the court of justice of the european union issue ruling pertaining to publicly accessible register which change the international context the judgment find that an eu requirement to implement publicly accessible register be contrary to the eu charter of fundamental right the uk be however satisfied with the lawfulness of our own publicly accessible register and we continue to believe that cd and ot could legally implement public register of their own not only that but no few than eu member state allow public access to their beneficial ownership register even after the november court ruling that should provide direction of travel and sense of security we have be in intense discussion with the territory and dependency since spring it have be huge priority for in recent month since my appointment as minister for the overseas territory to set out the rationale for our view that the register can indeed be fully implement in line with the privacy right that apply to each of they montserrat the falkland islands st helena ascension tristan da cunha and pitcairn have confirm that they be continue to implement theirs follow in the footstep of gibraltar which introduce its own in however anguilla bermuda the british virgin islands the cayman islands and the turks and caicos islands along with the crown dependency continue to have concern in the light of the court ruling give the differ view on the ruling we be work together to find way to make positive progress include by discuss an interim step that would make significant progress towards commitment to improve corporate transparency the implementation next year of publicly accessible register of beneficial ownership with legitimate interest access filter that would allow access to beneficial ownership information for member of the public with legitimate interest such as medium and civil society organisation involve in the fight against illicit finance and money laundering it would also bring the territory and dependency in line with the eu as the european court judgment note that eu member state must continue to enable access to those with legitimate interest rise will make one more point and then will gladly give way the right hon member for barking raise an issue regard request by transparency international to hmrc can not comment on individual case but if she write to will follow it up to be clear the government policy be that by definition legitimate interest should include civil society organisation such as transparency international the legitimate public interest filter as the minister call it stand or fall on how legitimate public interest be define at the moment it appear to be far too narrowly define which undermine the purpose of the transparency will he take into account the fact that the filter as it exist do not let any light through and be render the openness of the list moot that be not the intention we want the light to shine on these issue that will involve medium and non governmental organisation too can give the hon lady that reassurance rise will give way and then will wind up very quickly surely the problem be that if the minister be correct and any legitimate medium could make an inquiry any citizen with real interest could go to the medium and get the information that way that must be know in opt for the filter so presumably its purpose be only to be obstructive and to create legal barrier the filter be fundamental to the eu plan we want this to be important in and of itself and also step on the journey to have full beneficial ownership register that remain the case be conscious of time but want to assure the house that we be absolutely clear that we want to take this interim step far we will continue active discussion the majority of the five territory that we have talk about will sign up to the legitimate interest access filter and we will continue to have discussion with other jurisdiction that need to do more as set out in my response to the right hon member for barking intend to update the house with full detail before christmas and will lay write ministerial statement on the outcome of the ongoing negotiation we be continue far productive discussion with crown dependency in line with the overseas territory we be recognise our different legal position follow the court judgment but we be make our expectation clear that the register need to be implement during the course of next year again the home office will update parliament before the recess on the outcome of those serious discussion as we want to move forward in conclusion would like to give our great friend in the overseas territory and crown dependencie the message that we be determined and keen to achieve this important goal for we all the train be leave the station we know the direction of travel it be time for all our friend in the overseas territory and cd to get on board we will do all we can to support they and it remain clear priority what have be great about this debate be that we mostly agree across the house that have be the basis on which we have take action down the year and be grateful for that want to acknowledge the teamwork that have go on the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell and for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat both play key role in pursue transparency in the run up to and beyond before they become ministers transparency be just one tool in the fight against economic crime corruption and tax evasion and avoidance thank all the member who have take part in the debate my hon friend the members for wallasey dame angela eagle and for st helens south and whiston ms rimmer both mention the eye watering sum of money that be lose to the legitimate system through tax avoidance tax evasion and other way may thank everybody and finally say motion lapse standing order no violent crime and antisocial behaviour carshalton and wallington motion make and question propose that this house do now morrissey may begin by express how devastated be that the hon member for strangford jim shannon be not here to intervene on have hear that that be staple of adjournment debate but fear that will miss out on the opportunity nevertheless will soldier on and do what can would like to address grow concern in our community of carshalton and wallington violent crime and antisocial behaviour which demand our attention and be huge concern to my constituent be delighted that my constituency neighbour my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp be the minister respond today because he will know about many of these issue already be also delighted to be join by my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully who will know full well about some of the issue plan to raise will start with few recent example of violent crime and antisocial behaviour in the constituency on october man be fatally stab in roundshaw just week after tragic stabbing in the neighbouring borough of croydon which know the minister be aware of as the constituency mp for the area that follow number of recent attack not all of which take place in my constituency some occur in neighbour croydon include the tragic case of year old girl involve several of the many teenager who have be kill on london street in each one be tragedy in wallington man sustain thankfully non life threaten chest wound and woman suffer hand injury in knife attack on birchwood avenue last saturday thank the police for their work they always respond with the utmost professionalism and they do fantastic job also thank the air ambulance and nhs staff who care for the victim however such incident be of concern because the london borough of sutton which include carshalton and wallington have long enjoy reputation as one of the safe in london often compete with richmond violent crime be not something we be necessarily use to so see it happen on our street over the course of the last few month be of real concern like the inboxe of many of my colleague across the capital my inbox be often full of correspondence from resident concerned parent and other who feel vulnerable and unsafe because of the crime that be happen in their area it must not be allow to continue vividly remember one constituent writing to after the attack in roundshaw to say that she do not feel safe enough to put her bin out in the dark another teenage daughter do not want to leave the house for fear of be attack we must not let that become the new normal in london or anywhere for that matter my hon friend be make powerful speech we have have the sad news of the fatal stabbing of year old boy outside sutton station and year old be recently kill in the minister town of croydon not only do we have to lean into knife crime which be sometimes import into sutton we also need to make sure that we can bring down the fear of crime often it be import by gang but it be really important that we can reassure people that the police be there and that we have holistic view of knife crime in sutton absolutely thank my hon friend and constituency neighbour for that intervention he be absolutely right about the need to bring down the fear of crime and introduce measure to do that and would like to hear more from the minister about what step the home office be take in that respect my hon friend be absolutely right about provide reassurance and will go into that in bit more detail pay tribute to he for his time as one of the long serve ministers for london and for the work he do in this space he have be fantastic champion of his constituency and the capital and he be great loss to the government but be pleased to have he back on the back benches help to advocate for our fantastic borough of sutton on october just few week ago year old boy who be mind his own business be approach by another teenage boy who lead he to block of flat where three other teenager arm with knife await the young victim be rob of his phone that incident be one of many that underscore the vulnerability of our youth and the audacity of those who will prey on our child our child mind should be free to explore and not be occupy with threat to their life but sadly that be not an isolated incident our community have witness rise in house break in and people try car door one of the most common thing that see on social medium be ring doorbell footage of people try car door or front door late at night in our community that really make people feel violate and scar in their own home and that can not be right these doorbell camera deter crime in their own right often encourage my constituent to get they because thankfully have see many video where someone have clock ring doorbell camera and turn away from the house that be fantastic but it be awful how often such footage come up on social medium another fairly distressing incident be that of year old child who be slap at bus stop just couple of week ago though detail be still emerge and do not want to prejudice investigation in any of the case raise that incident underscore the urgency with which we must tackle the root cause of knife crime and antisocial behaviour in our community no child no parent and no person should be leave with the weight of that trauma or leave feel unsafe in their own community in our area in the last year theft be up by sexual offence be up by and robbery be up by those statistic be alarming and more so because they be not part of national trend across the whole of the united kingdom crime have fall since the minister will want to expand on the government record in bring crime down so we must ask ourselves why it be only within london that we do not see that trend be play out some responsibility in fact would argue quite lot must rest on the shoulder of the police and crime commissioner for london who also happen to be the mayor of london we have see london benefit from the massive increase in police officer we meet our manifesto commitment of new police officer and of those be work on the street of london yet we see this worrying trend with crime level even just this past week the mayor of london be catch out mislead londoners on statistic about crime in london he may not be prepared to put the work in and would rather spend his time jet off around the world try to sell his book legalise weed or whatever it be he be interested in do other than get on with his job however we can not leave criminal to take over the street of london so would really like to understand what work the home office be do with the metropolitan police to recapture the trust of londoners and get on with the job of deter and catch criminal ensure that our constituent those of the minister and my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam and mine be keep safe absolutely welcome the increase in police number but we face unique challenge on the fringe of london from which significant number of officer be regularly transfer away for major event in central london where help be need for police leave only minimal presence in outer london would like to hear bit more from the minister on the work that he be do in the home office with the metropolitan police to address that promptly so that when big event happen in central london neighbourhood and local policing in outer london do not suffer collaboration between the police and local community be also paramount and policing be only half the battle absolutely want to continue advocate for an increase police presence we all want to see bobby back on the beat and it be great to see those new police officer get out there in our community and do just that but we must also tackle the cause of crime and antisocial behaviour along the way education be crucial step in do that we have see how that have work in other part of the world and even here in the united kingdom glasgow be once the most violent city in the whole of europe it take different approach to violent crime and have turn that reputation around and drive down that number in london we be promise violence reduction unit that would tackle knife crime in similar way yet we have see no result from that violence reduction unit there be little transparency about who sit on it and what work they be do whether they have meet what they have speak about and when they meet the violence reduction unit for london have not achieve anything because as say early london be not follow the national trend for crime at the moment the challenge that we face be daunt but the spirit of our community be always resilient we must do all that we can to tackle violent crime and anti social behaviour and reclaim the safety and security of my constituent in carshalton and wallington and across the whole of london we need to ensure that we have constant and visible police presence on the street of sutton we need to ensure that people be aware of the consequence of criminal activity and educate they to prevent their turning to crime in the first place particularly our young people will not stop raise these issue and nor will my hon friend because until no one live in fear our community thrive and people value and protect each other we will not have achieve our aim it be pleasure to respond to my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington elliot colburn congratulate he on secure this adjournment debate and on his extremely powerful and eloquent speech which further his tireless campaign on this issue often in partnership with his constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully who have contribute already this evening this be an incredibly important topic say that not just as the minister for crime policing and fire but as the constituency neighbour on the other side of my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington be fellow south london mp so too see at first hand the effect of knife crime and serious violence on our community in particular in croydon but think across all of south london we feel for the family of elianne andam the year old girl who be brutally murder on the morning of september the whole community be incredibly move and mourn her loss go to her funeral with many other about people attend that funeral just few week ago it have profound impact on the whole borough and more widely across south london and we all need to redouble our effort to end the scourge of knife crime and serious violence although serious violence be down by over the last four year and even though homicide have reduce this year compare with last year and be low than it be in every single death and every single incident of serious violence or homicide be an individual tragedy and we need to do more to get the figure down even far on the government work in this area we have deliver record police number with across england and wales more police than we have ever have before that include more police than we have ever have across london in the metropolitan police however as my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington point out the mayor of london sadiq khan as london police and crime commissioner have be pretty deficient in manage the police force although there be record number in the met thank to government funding there could have be an extra officer government funding be available to recruit those officer to the met but the mayor of london thank to his ineptitude fail to recruit they knife crime in london have also increase on his watch he shamefully make claim to the contrary and be publicly rebuke by the office for national statistics for make misleading claim clearly the mayor of london need to do lot more to tackle knife crime let set out some of the thing that the government be do in this area one of they be fund violence reduction unit across the police force area where violent crime be the most serious those violence reduction unit which be manage by the police and crime commissioner but be fund by the government be design to make early intervention to identify people often young people who be on the wrong track and try to put they on the right track whether that be through educational intervention social service work sporting activity or whatever it may be we intend to continue support and expand the work of violence reduction unit support by the youth endowment fund which have receive million of government money we also want to stop the supply of knife get on to our street in the first place that be why we be legislate both through the criminal justice bill and through secondary legislation to ban certain zombie knife and machete that be currently legal double the sentence for sell knife to and give the police additional power to seize legal knife that be hold in private if they think those knife be go to be use for criminal purpose as for sell knife online the online safety act which receive royal assent just few week ago will when fully in force require online marketplace such as facebook marketplace to proactively prevent the sale of illegal knife online again choke off the supply of those knife into our community will the minister join in pay tribute to three people first ray and vi donovan be an incredible couple live in my constituency who help bring knife bin to the centre of sutton some truly horrific thing have be find in that knife bin but thankfully they be off the street secondly as the minister mention the online safety act will he join in congratulate my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully who be the minister who take that act through parliament in its final stage and manage to secure that important measure to stop knife be sell certainly join my hon friend in pay tribute to his constituent and their work on the knife bin we need to have more of those around and my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam do indeed take the online safety bill through its concluding stage in the house of commons be involve in an early stage of that bill passage but he be the minister who after number of year and number of ministers get it over the line it be also important to take action on the street and although it sometimes attract controversy stop and search be an important way of get knife off our street each month the metropolitan police take about knife off the street through stop and search which be an important part of the police arsenal when do lawfully and respectfully would like to see the police be more proactive use stop and search more use it more confidently and more widely to get those knife off the street some people raise concern about disproportionality but if we look at the success rate for find knife or drug on those people who be stop and search the percentage of stop and search result in find of knife or drug which be typically between and virtually exactly the same across all ethnic group that suggest that allegation that the police be behave unfairly be without foundation so would like to see stop and search use more the home office be also invest in the development of technology that will be able to covertly scan for knife as people walk down the street that technology be year or so away from be deployable but it be something we be invest in and it be something would like to see deploy on our street we be also invest in hotspot patrolling through project call grip hotspot patrol take place in area where serious violence be particular problem we be also run antisocial behaviour hotspot patrol in some force area those hotspot patrol will be roll out across the whole country from next april we find that where they take place antisocial behaviour and serious violence drop noticeably so we be go to be increase funding for hotspot patrol across the country from april finally draw the house attention to the importance of catch perpetrator and of use technology to do so my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington mention the availability of cctv footage these day lot of image be now available whether that be cctv footage from shop or local authority ring doorbell in people house dashcam footage or footage take on mobile phone the facial recognition algorithm that the police can run which take an image of criminal commit crime from any of those thing cctv mobile phone and so on and run it through the police database can now produce remarkably accurate match even when the image be not particularly clear therefore urge all police force to redouble their effort to always run those image through the police national database and to do the facial recognition search the evidence so far suggest that many perpetrator who would previously not have be catch now can be catch use retrospective facial recognition which be what have describe thank again my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington for secure this debate it be really important topic not just in south london or london more widely but across the whole country lot of progress have be make but there be more to do every single injury or death be tragedy and all of we in parliament and in government must work together with the police and other to ensure that we do everything humanly possible to end the scourge of knife crime which be far too frequent at the moment question put and agree to house adjourn
