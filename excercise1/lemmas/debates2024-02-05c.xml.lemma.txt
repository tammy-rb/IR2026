hear from the government when they plan to respond and remind they of the other power in place such as deprive people of the ability to drive or of their passport this be simple thing where people have the money and will not cough up the cash think we need to get on with curfew order my right hon friend be quite right that the government have consult on the use of curfew which be complex and interact with numerous government service several enforcement initiative aim at improve compliance be currently in train and we need to get those in place and assess their effect before we can well see how curfew might fit with they note her enthusiasm for curfew and might well put she in touch with viscount younger of leckie the minister in the lords whose policy brief this be so that he can update she on our late thinking benefit levels what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of level of benefit welfare be there to help those who need assistance include many of the most vulnerable which be why we increase most benefit by for that be on top of an increase of include the benefit cap in that be all very well but the rate of inflation for low pay family have be significantly high than the headline rate of inflation for some time that mean that those family who be struggle badly last year be struggle even bad this year citizens advice have show that family on low income have less disposable income this year than they have last year do the secretary of state accept that it be time to introduce an essential guarantee so that nobody on universal credit or another income base benefit can ever be allow to fall below level where they can not afford the basic essential of life as the hon gentleman will know we keep all benefit under review point he to various thing that we have do to ensure that we look after those low income family include increase the national living wage by about in both of the last two year the increase in the local housing allowance to the percentile announce at the last fiscal event which will be worth about year for about million people and of course the tax cut that the chancellor be able to bring forward which for an average earner be worth year call the snp spokesperson rather than deal with the know policy failure within the benefit system the government seem to be more focused on penalise people through for example the two child cap last week the labour party join the conservatives in prioritise lift the cap on banker bonus rather than the two child cap on work woman do the secretary of state take comfort in the fact that his cruel legacy will be protect by the labour party be not go to get involve in the crossfire between the scottish national party and the labour party other than to order do not need continue argument and disagreement be sure that when the question come to an end you can speak outside thank you mr speaker the two child cap be there for good reason so that family in those circumstance be take the same kind of decision that other the taxpayer funding benefit have to take child poverty what step he be take to help reduce child poverty what recent estimate he have make of the number of child in poverty in the late statistic there be few child in absolute poverty after housing cost than there be in in this financial year we will spend about billion on welfare support working age family we be also provide billion between and to help family with cost of living pressure however the government focus be firmly on reduce the risk of child poverty by support parent into work in every way we can the joseph rowntree foundation recently find that of child in bolton live below the poverty line after year of tory cut and general incompetence britain now have the bad rise in child poverty among the major country what would the minister say to young family in bolton who tell one day we eat and one day we do nobody on either side of the house want to see family struggle however repeat that child live in workless household be about five time more likely to be in absolute poverty after housing cost than those in household where all adult work the government be support the whole family through our childcare support which we have increase by almost to month for one child or for two the increase in the national living wage to from april our cost of live offer and so on the recent joseph rowntree foundation report highlight scotland much low child poverty rate compare with england and wales and say that that be partly due to the scottish government child payment further progress be constrain by the uk inadequate social security system the trussell trust guarantee our essential campaign show that of low income household on universal credit in the uk can not afford everyday essential do the minister accept that raise the universal credit basic rate be critical to tackle child poverty the welfare system be there to be strong safety net it be not about singular issue because no household be the same it be about wraparound care and deal with people on an individual basis it be about make sure that where child need support for example with free school meal we provide it call the shadow minister far to the minister response the prime minister have be ask similar question about child poverty in recent prime minister question he usually respond that since the conservatives have lift million people out of absolute poverty which as you know mr speaker track living standard from fix point in time can the minister tell how many more people on average labour lift out of absolute poverty annually compare with the million since that the prime minister regularly claim rather than trade number would say that this be about give people the dignity of job since million few people be in absolute poverty after housing cost include few child and million few working age adult know the hon lady say that work be not the labour party priority but it be very much our priority if the minister can point to an occasion when have say that work be not the labour party priority she ought to say when that be or she should withdraw that remark the answer to my question be that on average more than more people leave poverty in each year of the labour government the prime minister claim be pathetic which of the following do the minister think have the big impact on those poverty number be it when the conservatives repeal the child poverty act be it when they shut down the child poverty unit be it the collapse in the value of child benefit or be it the financial chaos cause by conservative prime minister in september which put all family finance at risk no it be the fact that over million more people be in work and youth employment be up by around ensure that people have the dignity of work and that when they be not in work there be strong welfare system around they be what this country need cost of living food bank what recent assessment his department have make of the potential relationship between increase in the cost of living and trend in the use of food bank what recent assessment his department have make of the potential relationship between increase in the cost of living and trend in the use of food bank the government take food security very seriously and be commit to understanding and address food poverty the reason that people use food bank be complex and varied food bank be independent charitable organisation and the government have no role in their operation as such datum on trend be not currently available the staff and volunteer at the norwood and brixton food bank in my constituency work tirelessly all year round to support local people who simply can not make end meet they be respond to the high level of need they have ever see why do the minister think that despite this be one of the rich country in the world food bank reliance be continue to rise so much on this government watch can she tell the house what the government be do to end the need for food bank in the uk as say the reason that people use food bank be complex and varied as all the research indicate we offer support through cost of living payment and the household support fund run to hundred of million of pound the rise in the national living wage the reduction in national insurance and the local housing allowance far help million low income household we have whole of suite of way to help the very poor in our society food bank such as the excellent luton foodbank have be push to breaking point this winter as more and more people need emergency food due to the conservatives cost of living crisis it be shameful that we now have more food bank than police station what conversation have the minister

further cost of living payment that will be go out this week to eligible household we do not comment on future fiscal announcement carer allowance what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the

play critical role ease the burden on health service for most carer care be job and they can not take full time work because of it when will the government realise that and now even be measly and do not scratch the surface of what carer have to put up with and pay for particularly when many carer be care for more than one person thank the hon gentleman for his point which appreciate as have be in that situation of care for two people the primary purpose of the carer allowance be to provide measure of financial support and recognition for people unable to work full time because of their caring responsibility know there be very strong view on this be look forward to meet with carers uk just after recess be afraid can not do so before due to funeral and hear the vary view and how we can

person who need our support ill health economic inactivity what estimate his department have make of the cost to the public purse of economic inactivity due to ill health what step his department be take to reduce labour inactivity what step his department be take to reduce labour inactivity there be of course significant cost relate to an increase in long term sickness and illness rate in work that be why we have our billion back to work plan to help disabled people and people with health condition start and stay in work that approach along with other have see economic inactivity reduce by since its peak during the pandemic nhs waiting list be currently at million with more than people on waiting list in my own nhs trust area when it be this difficult to access medical treatment it be no surprise that we have record million people out of work due to ill health do the minister accept that this government failure on the nhs be stymie economic growth deny people the dignity of work and cost taxpayer billion of pound on nhs waiting list there have be progress in that the two year waiting list have almost be entirely dispense with and those of month have be very substantially reduce our department recognise that work be part of the solution to improve people health which be why we be put forward the workwell service bring together medical input and work coach input fit

campaigner for and supporter of employment in his patch he ask whether will visit his constituency would certainly like to consider that but my hon friend the employment minister might also visit because she just say she be particularly keen to do so there we be burnley and padiham have so much go for it with the rest of lancashire our area be the manufacture powerhouse of the united kingdom but still have stubborn level of economic inactivity among people who could be contribute to economic growth and have financial security which we all want they to have what more can we do to help those people in particular can my right hon friend do more to join up with other departments so that area such as burnley which might have structural problem get more intensive support my hon friend ask what approach we can take to resolve the issue that he have raise we have announce doubling of universal support scheme with which he will be familiar workwell to which just refer bring together medical support and work coach and reform of the fit note system so that we get involve early in the journey that many people experience when they fall out of the workforce into long term sickness and

employment rate in her constituency be well above the national average which put down almost entirely to the work that she be do she ask how we would proceed we already have swap bootcamp and returnership but be indeed look at specific area of the labour market particularly in the context of migration change where we may be able to do more on strategic basis state pension uk citizens live overseas what recent assessment he have make of the potential cost of restore parity in the level of state pension receive by uk citizen live overseas accord to the late estimate base on datum from march uprate the state pension where we do not currently do so would cost about billion year if all uk state pension in payment be increase to current uk level follow our withdrawal from the eu we be rightly able to move close to our partner in the commonwealth one way in which we could do that would be to confirm that all british citizen who live in the commonwealth should be entitle to the appropriate uprating of their state pension as if they be still in the uk that would seem to be matter of simple fairness will the minister meet to discuss the practicality of make it happen and restore some much need common sense to needlessly complicated situation the uk government continue to uprate state pension when there be legal requirement for that to be do and have no plan to change their long stand policy or enter into new reciprocal social security agreement benefit claims process cancer patient if he will take step to simplify the benefit claim process for cancer patient understandably such health diagnosis can be shock for individual their family and indeed their finance and be conscious of say this just after world cancer day it be important to ensure that people

co operate with the parliamentary and health service ombudsman investigation which be ongoing and it would not be appropriate to comment on it or the outcome my constituent universal credit payment have be stop over christmas for two year run because her employer pay her salary early in december why will ministers not do more to ensure that caseworker know that they can use the discretion that they have so that my constituent and other like she have financial certainty at what be very difficult time of year the way that universal credit work mean that work coach can use their flexibility but if payment be short one month the appropriate thing to do be to sort it the next in his opening remark the secretary of state mention the assessment period for cost of living payment but people on four weekly pay schedule miss out on support because they fall foul of the assessment period rule for universal credit what assessment have the government make of the number of people miss out and what remedy do they have cost of living payment can be affect by when people be pay and therefore by whether they be on universal credit and qualify at precisely that point do not have the figure to hand that the hon lady request but will of course get back to she with it this morning report by the academy of medical sciences reveal that our appalling child health and infant mortality rate be bad than those of of similar country and be the key driver of child poverty what assessment have the secretary of state undertake to make on the impact that stop the household support fund in april will have on relative child poverty and subsequently infant mortality as the hon lady will know the number of those in child poverty have decrease by since we do not yet have decision on the household support fund to which she refer but point she to the very significant uplift in the local housing allowance which will give million people year more on average thereby take many of they out of poverty from unanswered email to unreturned call it have be heartbreaking to hear from so many vulnerable constituent who be in state of limbo and distress and try to chase up personal independence payment when will minister ensure that people can get the support that they need in timely and straightforward manner if the hon gentleman have specific example would be keen to hear from he and to look into they call the chair of the work and pensions committee will the secretary of state point out to the chancellor that many council have use the household support fund to pay per day per child during the school holiday to family entitle to free school meal and that if the fund close at the end of march those family will be straight into hardship in the easter school holiday thank the right hon gentleman for his representation and indeed would be grateful for any other that he be minded to make to as we conduct our ongoing review on where we go with the household support fund when will the minister wake up to the fact that work as an apprentice in engineering be fabulous career choice and well pay will she come up to huddersfield to look at cummins whose apprentice system be first rate would be delighted to do so on my tour of england could not agree more with the hon gentleman my father be an engineer it be fantastic profession and the more we can encourage apprenticeship right across the board the well nearly million people have now take they up would be delighted to come situation in the red sea with permission will make statement on the recent response to houthi aggression in the red sea freedom of navigation have be cornerstone of civilisation since time immemorial it underpin our prosperity and security and be found principle of the international rule base system since october the houthis supply and aid by iran have be infringe on those fundamental freedom by attack international commercial vessel in the red sea and in the gulf of aden on november they illegally seize the merchant vessel galaxy leader use helicopter borne assault crew and since then they have conduct around attack against commercial and military vessel despite repeat warning their attack have continue the uk have always stand up for the rule base international order and since the houthis begin their illegal attack we have be at the forefront of the international response whether help to defend vessel in the vicinity as one of the first member to join the us lead taskforce operation prosperity guardian or work in tandem with the us and other ally to tackle the houthis always in response to specific threat and always in line with international law and the principle of self defence on two previous occasion we have be require to use force and those attack have have significant effect in degrade houthi capability but the houthis intent to continue disrupt the red sea have not be fully diminish two week ago the prime minister come to the house to make it clear as do the follow day that unless the houthis desist from their inflammatory action we would not hesitate to act again yet instead of cease their activity they have choose to persist accompany their increasingly incendiary rhetoric with further missile and drone target at shipping and at the royal navy most recently the houthis set the vessel marlin luanda on fire and target hms diamond directly in the red sea such behaviour be simply intolerable it break international law and be already have consequence that be damaging to the economy of the world insurance premium have rocket tenfold since the start of december the number of cargo ship transit bab al mandab have fall and the cost of container have rocket all of which could send food inflation spiral and will certainly hit those country with the great poverty level the hard the houthis believe that they be the region robin hood but as discuss with the yemeni defence minister just yesterday when see he in saudi the only people they be rob be innocent yeminis whose food and aid arrive via the red sea that be why at the weekend the prime minister and again authorise the use of force in strict accordance with international law and in self defence on saturday royal air force typhoons support by two voyager tanker join the us force to conduct further precision strike against houthi location in yemen the typhoons employ paveway iv precision guide munition against three military facility hit separate target which be identify after careful intelligence analysis at those three location and approve by at as salif due west of on the red sea coast our aircraft target ground control station inside defensive position the station have be use to control houthi attack and reconnaissance drone launch from far inland and operate over the red sea target at international shipping second drone ground control station be confirm to be al munirah on the same stretch of coastline as with as salif the station provide direct control of reconnaissance and attack drone target shipping in the red sea its position on the coast allow it to maintain the line of sight datum link use to target innocent shipping with accuracy our typhoons also attack significant number of target at bani the house may recall that an initial group of facility at bani be successfully strike by the raf on the night of january this year since then further set of building at the site have be positively confirm to be involve in the houthi operation and be as result target on this occasion as be standard practice for operation by the raf the strike be very carefully plan to ensure minimal risk of civilian casualty dropping munition at night far reduce such risk and we do not believe there be any civilian casualty on saturday night military action can only be one element in our effort to confront these global challenge and military action be indeed the very last resort it would be far well if the houthis stop their attack our approach be therefore found on four pillar first we be increase diplomatic engagement the foreign secretary travel to the region and meet his iranian counterpart last month to make it clear that iran must cease supply the houthis with weapon and intelligence and use its influence to stop the houthi attack the prime minister speak to president biden recently to discuss our joint approach and meet my counterpart in the region this weekend return this morning from the kingdom of saudi arabia where discuss regional security secondly we must end the illegal flow of arm to the houthis britain and the us have previously intercept weapon shipment in the region include the same kind of component that we have see use in recent strike thirdly we must cut off the houthis financial resource we have already we do so last month sanction four key figure within the houthi regime include the commander of the houthi naval force and the houthi defence minister fourthly we continue to help the people of yemen deliver humanitarian aid and support negotiate peace the uk have commit million in humanitarian support so far this year feed yemenis every month with aid arrive through the very sea route which ironically the houthis be target let be absolutely clear we would much rather the houthis simply stop attack international shipping stop damage global trade and stop harm the prospect of their own people at the same time appease the houthis today will not lead to more stable red sea or indeed more stable region we be not seek confrontation and we urge the houthis and all those who enable they to stop these illegal and unacceptable attack however if necessary the uk will not hesitate to respond again in self defence placate the sponsor of terror do not benefit our international order in the long run or bring peace to the middle east or elsewhere in europe or the world the truth be that we can not ignore the importance of these great waterway for shipping that be the reason the world back the united nations convention on the law of the sea it be the reason new zealand have join the uk the us australia canada bahrain denmark and the netherlands in provide support to this weekend air strike as an island nation we have always appreciate freedom of navigation and the fact that it be intrinsic to our way of life if we do not deal with these threat every nation will be poor commend this statement to the house thank the defence secretary for the advance copy of his statement we back the uk us airstrike that take place at the weekend to protect shipping in the red sea we know that the strike be carry out against houthi command centre and weapon store we accept that they be limited necessary and target to minimise the risk of civilian casualty the houthis be attack the ship of many nation threaten maritime security and international trade and put civilian and military life in serious danger that be why the un security council pass last month resolution condemn houthi action in the strong possible term and demand that their attack stop we accept that the strike we justify but will the defence secretary confirm that they be also effective be the target select the target hit be the purpose of destroy the drone control centre at as salif and al munirah fully achieve minister have say that the aim of the strike be first to deter houthi attack and secondly to degrade their capability the first aim have not yet succeed as houthi attack continue but be the fact that those attack be now less sophisticated and more sporadic sign that the second aim may be succeed this be the third uk us strike in the past three week at what stage do three one off strike become sustained campaign if this do develop into continue military action at what stage will the government give parliament say before turn to the wide role of uk force in the red sea let make this point it be the prime minister who should be make this statement to the house just as he do after the two previous uk strike on houthi target it be the prime minister responsibility to authorise such uk military action in the name of the cabinet advise by other of course include and especially the defence secretary the government risk downgrade respect for the convention that have give the go ahead for such action it be the prime minister who then report directly to this house we also back the lead role of the royal navy in the continue defence of shipping from all nation in the red sea what action be the government take to persuade other country to join the prosperity guardian protection force how long do the defence secretary expect operation prosperity guardian to be need how will the eu new maritime mission to the red sea co ordinate operation with prosperity guardian two week ago ask the defence secretary if uk carrier be ready to deploy to the red sea we now know that hms queen elizabeth have serious problem so do the uk still have the option of send carrier to the red sea if require and if so when military action on its own can not solve the problem in the region what be the government diplomatic action to pressure the houthis to cease their attack and settle the civil war in yemen and to pressure iran to stop supply weapon and intelligence to the houthis finally like the defence secretary totally reject the houthi claim that fire missile and drone at ship from around the world be somehow link to the conflict in gaza they have be attack oil tanker and seize ship for at least five year not just for the day since october those attack do absolutely nothing for the palestinian people whose agony be now extreme we want the gaza fighting to stop now with humanitarian truce that can build into sustainable ceasefire to stop the killing of innocent civilian get all the remain hostage out and get much more aid into gaza the uk aid effort must be accelerate have any more raf flight take off since the defence secretary be last in this chamber and if not why not finally for long term peace there have to be political process that can turn the rhetoric around two state live side by side in peace into reality the house be unite in that uk vision and give this commitment from our side if elect to form the next government labour will lead this new push for peace first welcome the right hon gentleman support for this action he ask series of question which will rattle through be the action effective yes they hit the target be all the target hit again yes we be still carry out surveillance to find out the exact impact but think we can be very confident that all the relevant objective be reach we combine very closely with our us colleague and sometimes interchange some of those target with they the right hon gentleman will have note that on this occasion we be involve in drop munition on more target than previously so we carry slightly great weight than before the right hon gentleman ask whether the action be successful and rightly point out that what we be see be rather more sporadic the attack include on hms diamond and on merchant shipping have continue but in much more ad hoc fashion it be perhaps relevant that there have be no attack use multiple different weapon at the same time which we see for example on january the degrading will have have some impact on report february vol correction will come back to the right hon gentleman comment about the prime minister at the end want to set the record straight the right hon gentleman ask about operation prosperity guardian the simple answer of course be that none of we know how long it will need to continue for but we want it to come to conclusion as quickly as possible we utterly reject any notion that these continue attack by the houthis be anything to do with the situation in gaza the houthis be opportunist pirate who be use situation to their benefit few year ago they do not even support hamas but suddenly they want to be their great champion they be over kilometre away from gaza they be simply use the situation to their advantage and it be wise for the house to not over link the two none the less the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to about the need to see humanitarian truce and sustainable ceasefire that be the government policy we be work extremely hard to try to achieve that include through discussion that the prime minister the foreign secretary and myself be have just yesterday be have those discussion in the middle east the right hon gentleman ask about raf flight the issue be not get the aid to location have be work very closely with the cypriot government for example on how we can increase the amount of aid the single big problem remain get the aid into the country we have some success with get kerem shalom open but what we really need to see be ashdod open in order to route that aid to kerem shalom and straight into gaza the government and will continue to push for that route but the problem be not the flight take off it be the aid get in finally turn to the fact that it be myself as defence secretary stand at the dispatch box rather than the prime minister the first thing to say be that it be the secretary of state for defence who actually have legal responsibility for these action who sign off the target and indeed the legal authority technically it be who should be stand here other than for the first couple of round where the prime minister be deal with something new and it be therefore very appropriate for he to be at the dispatch box the wide point that would gently make to the right hon gentleman though be that the prime minister be in northern ireland today do incredibly important hear from sedentary position the suggestion that we should have be recall yesterday but unsure whether that would have be entirely practical it be entirely appropriate that the prime minister be in northern ireland would have think that the house would welcome the fact that that historic breakthrough have be mark by the prime minister and it be very appropriate that be here today to explain the activity of saturday night to the house do the government accept that it be difficult to deter terrorist fanatic and that one mainly have to contain the effectiveness of what they do until they be ultimately destroy preferably by our regional ally do the secretary of state feel that there be in fact link to separate conflict and that be the conflict in ukraine be it not more than coincidence that the proxy of russia ally in the middle east have be so much more active while russia be so desperate for we to turn our attention away from support ukraine as ever my right hon friend have absolutely hit the nail on the head russia and iran be work together actually the same kind of drone sometimes the shahed drone that be be fire in ukraine by the russians courtesy of iran be also be fire by the houthis he make an excellent linkage point and he be absolutely right call the snp spokesperson the people of scotland and elsewhere on these island deserve to know what the plan be for this crisis in the red sea not the timing the detail of mission the tactical ambition or the resource behind these but the broad strategy be pursue with lethal force in our name and in the absence of parliamentary approval we have already make it clear from the snp benches that we support the government and international partner in direct action to uphold freedom of navigation and the law of the sea but this should never have be take for grant and it remain subject to realistic interpretation of both self defence and imminence we see the toll that russia illegal invasion of ukraine have take on our constituent and business over energy cost so we can not allow this to be compound far by interrupt global supply chain nor can we ever tolerate or stand idly by while seafarer be put at risk whatever the suppose aim of the houthis or their backer may be will this be sustained engagement do not know and neither do the rest of parliament one way or another an ally seaborne strike capability will be engage so with one of the two aircraft carrier in the royal navy out of commission again the type frigate fleet on its knee and the type destroyer fleet still go through pip the power improvement project who in the government have grip of the royal navy resource fundamentally what be the uk government plan to ensure that this campaign be not escalatory and what be the thinking behind any assessment that they have make in closing this be not about support gazans or people die or flee persecution in gaza but about the houthis pursue their own aim however would be interested to know what the government assessment be of the uptick in temperature in the middle east in gaza in yemen and with nato ally personnel be kill listen carefully to the hon gentleman detect that he support the action that have be take as have say it can not be right that international shipping be prevent from its own freedom of navigation again respect the will of the house and listen very carefully it be quite clear that the official opposition support this action as do the government and as now learn do those on his own benches and remember the liberal democrats say it previously so think it be quite clear that there be strong support in this house it be also important that there be sufficient freedom of action to ensure the safety and security of our airman and woman when they undertake these action rather than flag they substantially in advance the hon gentleman mention and so do the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey the aircraft carrier and should just address this point it be the case that actually through an abundance of caution on final inspection the decision be take for the aircraft carrier not to sail have speak to the first sea lord who have make it clear to that if there have be an emergency situation the house will recall that it be go to join exercise steadfast defender it quite probably would have sail the fact be that we have another one and that will sail to the exercise on the frigate and the destroyer just disagree with the hon gentleman have be out to visit those on hms diamond in the red sea and they be absolutely prepared and ready to go that one as the hon gentleman say that be one but today that ship have be replace by hms richmond which now take on that mantle we have ship under construction or on order wonder how many we would get from the snp with its approach to defence thank my right hon friend for his in depth statement but there be concern about stretch the royal navy it be lead world class navy but it be suffer from personnel issue in crew the ship and responsibility for that lie back at the treasury provide the revenue stream need to make sure the capital equipment we have get can be use most effectively what representation be my right hon friend make to ensure that the growth in maritime concern around the world will be meet by commitment from the treasury on wide armed force and mod note we have billion for equipment over the next year my right hon friend be absolutely right that that have to be match with the sailor the airman and woman and the army able to resource that equipment and have some good news for he since we have be talk very actively about these issue we have see an eight year high in application to the royal navy six year high in application to the army and increase between this january and last january in application to join the royal air force predict we be make progress wonder whether the secretary of state have see the front page of the financial times today because it outline how iran have be use lloyds and santander account to evade sanction the us be accuse front company of fund the irgc with hundred of million of dollar and work with russian intelligence to raise money for iranian proxy be sure all in this house would be appal to know that money launder here in our capital be be use against our own troop by the houthis so what assessment have the government make of those allegation by our ally do that not yet again show that we must proscribe the irgc now this issue be repeatedly raise in the house and the hon lady will know as she will have hear the response many time before that we do not routinely comment on proscription it be the case however that we do sanction and we have sanction the entirety of the irgc already as well as take number of different action she will appreciate that this matter do not come directly within the defence portfolio but know that she will have the opportunity to press foreign office and home office ministers at future time and we do keep this matter under constant review agree with the secretary of state and the government that we do not want to see an escalation in the region and that we want to be proportionate in our response and calibrate our response not to provoke and antagonise but be it not the case that we might actually be hit the wrong target that we be hit proxy of iran and while believe in peace and diplomacy the malevolent factor in the region in all of this be iran it might be the case that while we have the good of diplomatic intention and we do not want to provoke iran to major conflict with nato the us or the uk put off that decision now will cost more life in the future iran and the regime not the iranian people but the regime in iran be behind all this they be the one destabilise israel the abraham accord and so on hope the secretary of state will take strategic view and make hard choice on iran because whether we like it or not it be come my right hon friend make the excellent point that iran be behind all this iran be behind hamas hezbollah the houthis and the irgc align militia that we have see attack not just american troop often hear it be american personnel have be attack separate time in syria and iraq but in fact about third of those occasion involve british troop as well on every occasion iran be behind all of this absolutely agree with my right hon friend and we be work hard to pressurise iran into realise that its current approach can do no good at all and will destabilise the region which it claim it do not want to do let first make the point that direct attack on iran would be insanity the region would be provoke and other would be drag into it understand why the government be say that it be wise to not over link houthis strike with gaza but the reality be that the middle east region be on the edge of conflagration as result of the war that be go on and the attack on gaza the priority must therefore be to secure peace in gaza we have limited role in that but we know that netanyahu would secure peace if pressurise to do so by the american government because realistically they be the only power that can influence he and israeli strategy what further talk have take place with the biden government to ensure that they exercise the maximum pressure on netanyahu to get to that peace negotiating table the right hon gentleman will be aware hope that the uk and the us work very closely on this be in the states last week meet blinken lloyd austin and other to discuss exactly the point that the right hon gentleman raise about how we bring together solution that not only provide ultimately the palestinian state for the palestinian people but security guarantee for israel it be also important to realise that we be work closely in number of different sphere include on the lebanese border where we be work hard to try to prevent further conflict there we should remember that israelis have have to move from that border because of the activity of lebanese hezbollah we be work with the lebanese government see the yemeni defence minister yesterday and we discuss how to prevent that conflict from become part of this too the government be pull every single possible diplomatic lever in what be clearly very complex position the defence secretary be right that this mission must continue to stand up and defend international law in the red sea but the mission to remove the houthi threat and keep the red sea safe could last month and it be not sustainable to continue task typhoons from cyprus for each mission or subsequent future threat will the defence secretary therefore agree that there be case for an urgent operational requirement to upgrade the destroyer give the continued inability of their vertical launch system to strike target at range inland know that my right hon friend take huge interest in this matter and he will be interested to hear that on friday be on hms somerset in devonport where they be fit surface to surface system which may or may not be appropriate in this particular type of conflict want to take issue with one thing we be in coalition here work with the us and other as we have demonstrate repeatedly there be no issue with typhoons fly long distance indeed when america carry out their unrelated attack for tower they fly all the way from the united states fly long distance be no sign that the capability be not there in itself will the secretary of state please have another go at give well answer to the question from the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran about the extremely serious report in today financial times that two of britain main bank be indirectly help to fund the houthis with whom we be now in some sort of conflict the right hon gentleman will have hear my answer moment ago know that he want to go into further detail but be unable to do that at the dispatch box right now we have note both the question and the article of this morning we be also intensely engage in find the good way to ensure that iranian influence whether through the uk or in the region be limited do not think can go far at this moment the houthi rebel be violent extremist antisemite and it be right that we take action to combat their aggression in the red sea it seem that there be success in degrade their capability be the secretary of state confident that we will get to the point where we can stop the attack altogether think the clock be run down for the houthis in as much as their ability be be degrade as my right hon friend point out they do not have the eye and ear from the radar station they be more reliant still on iran and only the uk and the us have do interdiction of their weapon there be limitation to this none the less we still think that would continue if they choose to even at that low level but it be important that they cease and stop this we be put pressure on as have describe through every possible mean include very extensive talk that have yesterday in saudi arabia with various different people include not just the saudis but the yemenis themselves will the secretary of state confirm what the long term strategy be and how it relate to the ongoing precarious situation in yemen do the government plan to commit to sustained military action if so surely it be only right for parliament to have its say in the appropriate way this be the third time that we have come to parliament and make statement know that the hon lady have make other contribution to the debate so we do feel that parliament be be fully engage in the process we be not look to make this sustained long term military action indeed can guarantee for the house that if the houthis stop we will have absolutely no requirement again to drop munition on they but it be fact that they be the one interrupt international maritime activity and we can not stand by and allow that to happen the defence secretary can not comment specifically on target acquisition but will he please confirm to the house that our intelligence surveillance target acquisition and reconnaissance be focus on those houthi capability directly engage in the attack on international shipping be it reasonable to assume that further degradation of those capability will result in increase security in the red sea my hon friend ask good question that have not yet be ask the answer be yes we be look carefully and the location choose on this occasion be indeed from combination of us and uk intelligence the government be right to have this strong response for what may seem to many to be faraway war or incident but which could impact so much on people life here in the united kingdom through food shortage supply chain disruption and inflation give the report about shortage of royal navy personnel the difficulty with munition the difficulty with some ship and now the increase demand on the navy because of tension with china and russia maybe even argentina in future will the secretary of state assure we that we have the capability to play our part in keep supply chain open what discussion have he have with other ally to get they involve in the task of support we in this job the right hon gentleman be right about the importance of trade some of our good come to this country via the sea so it really matter to the united kingdom but it matter to the whole world he mention personnel munition and so on as have one or two other member in my time as defence secretary have not be unable to deploy exactly where have need to for example at the request of nato when we deploy to kosovo they have return home now or for this conflict in the middle east where we have need to carry out the action that we be discuss on each occasion those have be available previously mention billion year programme on equipment and the success in recruit more personnel encourage other country to match our defence budget which be comfortably above of gdp and head up to soon they do that the well fully support the government action in the red sea the irony of the iranian regime accuse we of destabilise the region through our action will not be lose on reasonable people do the secretary of state agree that those demonstrator on the street of london applaud what the houthi rebel have be do be at good useful idiot and at bad truly the enemy within use my own language but it be disgraceful to see people go out and support those who be indiscriminately fire at merchant ship that be absolutely appalling will not repeat my hon friend language will put that support down to ignorance rather than anything else the secretary of state be rightly clear about breach of international law by the houthis in the red sea can he be equally clear about breach of international law by all side in gaza do he think it will help reduce hostility across the middle east if the government can build broad international coalition in support of their diplomatic and military aim the united kingdom government always want international humanitarian law to be adhere to and we make that point repeatedly to every side in this conflict think the hon gentleman be drive at israel to answer his question directly israel be include hamas could end the conflict very quickly if they release the hostage that they have kidnap and cease fire on israel on the wide coalition describe how new zealand be now on board with the military action but should mention that plus country be involve in operation prosperity guardian and the eu have form an additional operation which we welcome far to the question from my hon friend the member for ipswich tom hunt as well as open support for the houthis this weekend on the street of central london some protestor in the pro palestinian march again call for an intifada and hold up deeply racist antisemitic sign one of which include inform israelis we presume jewish israelis that they be indigenous to nowhere other than hell be not sure that it be just ignorance think something more sinister be at play among some of the protestor we should call it what it be pure and simple jew hate will the secretary of state inform the house whether he have speak to anyone else across government about more action to deal with some of the hate on our street the home secretary continuously keep this matter under review and meet police chief to ensure that they have the power to combat what my hon friend rightly describe as absolutely disgusting behaviour which have no place at all on our street be sure that the whole house need no reminding but perhaps the people who go out campaigning do the houthis slogan be death to america death to israel death to the jews no matter where they be there be no place for that on the street of britain it be an extraordinary situation where the secretary of state come here make matter of fact statement about the launch of missile against number of target and country give no indication of the long term war aim by the uk at present and say absolutely nothing about the crying desperate need for ceasefire to protect the people of gaza from further death and destruction do he not realise that the extension of the conflict by britain and the united states to at least four other country risk huge conflagration across the whole region would have be much happy have he come here and say that britain be determined to try to deal with the injustice in the region and to bring about peace process rather than further militarisation of the seaway around all those country surely peace be something to aim for rather than the continuation of yet more war never have disagree so much with the right hon gentleman and that be say something give that he want to scrap trident and pull we out of nato the statement be on the red sea be surprised that he be not more appreciative of the geography the attack in the red sea be very long way from gaza he misunderstand why have come to this house to talk about munition on single country not three country as he say speak to the yemeni government yesterday who thank we for our work it be shame that he can not do the same commend the defence secretary for his excellent work he talk about yemen its foreign minister ahmad awad bin mubarak say on thursday that there be no doubt that iran quds force operative have be deploy to his own coastline what assessment have my right hon friend make of the extent of iran aggressive military adventurism and its destabilising effect on international peace and security quite simply iran be malign influence not just on yemen but on the entire region my right hon and learn friend be right to point out the manner in which it have help to create instability in the red sea be afraid that the only language that the iranians understand be the approach that we have be take to show they that there be red line and they have cross it completely understand and agree with the need to protect international shipping and maritime security and to ensure the safety of civilian and seafarer in the red sea however some of we be also concerned about wide escalation in this already volatile region will the defence secretary outline what step the government be take diplomatic or otherwise to stop we be suck into an escalating regional conflict the action we be discuss be very specific and targeted as the hon gentleman will recognise they be not open to be repeat unless the attack on we continue so they can actually be stop immediately in term of wide diplomacy which have go into in some detail have meet with sullivan blinken and lloyd austin in the states while the foreign secretary have be do the same with his opposite number as have just describe be in the region until this morning where be have extensive discussion on how to bring this situation to conclusion be afraid it be not always possible to provide line by line explanation of every single element of those talk which appreciate be frustrating for the house but we be make broad and strenuous effort to achieve exactly what the hon gentleman be look for the defence secretary have say the government be look at comprehensive strategy with four pronged approach to degrade the houthis we have classify the action of the houthis as terrorist and say that they pose significant threat to british interest then look at the proscribed terrorist organisations document from the house of commons library which list non state actor ansar al islam al ittihad al islamia and hezbollah all of which meet the criterion for proscription yet the houthis be not proscribe as terrorist organisation the secretary of state say that we have sanction some high level individual the us have proscribe they we have not my question to the defence secretary be this will the uk set up contact group to deal with non state actor in the long term this threat be not go to go away the houthis will splinter into other terrorist organisation in the region my hon friend rightly point out that the us have take some action although it be not quite the same as our proscription what it have do in this case with the houthis be sort of an in between version of course we have make sure that number of individual whom name in my comment have effectively be deal with the wide question be get the balance right between ensure that food aid can still reach yemen that be the discussion be have with the yemeni government yesterday and full proscription we need to make sure we get that balance right and my right hon friend the home secretary be work very closely on that whether one would call that contact group or something else can assure my hon friend that the work be be do like other commend the government diplomatic effort to resolve the broad conflict and this one in fact if diplomatic mean fail to resolve this particular conflict in the red sea be the secretary of state determine to pursue the military option to the very end as have describe in answer to other member we see this action as be very specific and one that do not need to continue what do not see as be short term and specific be the diplomatic process that the hon gentleman refer to which now need to do what the world have be unable to do for decade form wide peace in the middle east the piece may be there with potential normalisation between country such as saudi arabia and israel hamas intent and iran intent be to disrupt all of that we understand that which be why we have to work all the hard to overcome their approach to create instability in the region we can not overestimate the value of freedom of navigation in the region so it be not surprising that new zealand have join the uk the us australia canada bahrain denmark and the netherlands in provide support over the weekend what concern be egypt which face both economic and social disadvantage the suez canal provide billion of trade to the egyptian economy and the last thing we want be for that to be disrupt can the secretary of state advise what he will do to help to counter the destabilising activity of the houthi pirate in the region my hon friend be absolutely right to say that this be devastating for the egyptian economy be in egypt couple of week ago where meet my opposite number the egyptian defence minister and we discuss exactly this point clearly ship be avoid the area and take much long route around at the moment so it be in everybody interest and those of the suez canal in particular to see this resolve as quickly as possible it be report last night that only the uk and us be involve actively in the military action over the weekend with that be attribute to the different risk assessment that the uk and us have compare with other international partner be that the case if so will the secretary of state discuss what the particular concern be in the different risk assessment in respect of escalation of the conflict it be difficult for to answer on why different country would take part or not much wide group of country take part in operation prosperity guardian the freedom of navigation part of this number of the other country have actively provide assistance include intelligence officer and the like the truth of the matter be that only relatively few country have the capability the capacity to carry out this action and it should be matter of pride that when push come to shove it be the uk that be able to step up and carry out some of this difficult work give the continue attack by iranian back houthis will the government as well as pursue diplomacy and try to stop the illegal flow of weapon and finance be prepared to intensify military action with our ally in self defence to degrade the ability to make further attack on commercial shipping should be absolutely clear we will only act within international law that law be about self defence so we respond to the attack in turn we be not look to increase the implication of this as have describe carefully because we want to bring it to close however this remain open ended and we will have to go back if the attack do not stop it be not simply the houthis who say that this issue be inextricably link to gaza the embassy of yemen have make that clear in paragraph of its letter to all mp and brigadier deverell the former british military attaché in yemen and saudi arabia have say that it be link he have go on to add that these strike will fail and will not resolve the situation so rather than lurch towards world war three and rather than an escalation of the conflict widen it beyond country and this limited territory be it not time to ensure that israel be call to heel that its genocide cease and that we get an immediate ceasefire interruption think the hon gentleman will detect that the house have not follow the logic of his argument there be difference between this absolutely not be inextricably link to gaza apart from when opposition member might try to link it and the houthis claim that it be somehow link as badge of convenience as way of try to muscle in on that action be very very sorry that the hon gentleman choose to repeat their propaganda in addition to the irgc deployment on the coastline of yemen that my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis reference tehran have deploy its alborz warship to the red sea we also know that two us navy seal have die after attempt to seize iranian weapon bind for the houthis yet iran continue to evade any meaningful deterrence do the secretary of state agree that iran must not be allow to outsource the responsibility for its regional escalation to its proxy and must be deter directly my hon friend make an excellent point about the link between the iranian ship that loiter in the region and the item that be ship to the houthis which we know come from iran because of the interdiction that we have make previously it be probably wise if do not go into too much detail but to say that we be aware of this be absolutely correct and the whole world need to carry on pile the pressure on iran to cease and desist from this behaviour the defence secretary be right to highlight the risk to humanitarian aid in the region not least give the catastrophic situation in gaza what step have he deploy over the last four month through air capability as well as sea capability to establish route for aid to reach gaza by sea or by air would link that with the action we have be take to degrade the houthis ability to prevent aid from reach people as say in my statement the yemenis obtain almost all their food via the red sea so would class all the action that we have take in three round of strike as very much part of get that food into the country as mention we provide significant amount of aid we feed about yemenis month on the back of it and it be the houthis who be try to prevent that from happen we support the right for shipping to pass freely have talk to business understand that they be already feel the effect on their supply chain if one of the purpose of the strike be to deter the houthis it seem that they have not get the message yet and it be not clear whether they ever will fear there be risk that we be go to escalate action in the region the secretary of state have mention number of activity that he have undertake on non military basis to try to reduce tension but be there anything he can do that he have not do already to help end this conflict although it be clear that the houthi attack have not end as the shadow defence secretary say there do appear to have be difference in the cadence the mass attack that we see on january for example have not be repeat partly because the houthis ability have be report february vol correction however we be always look at other mean include route via the united nations and at the wide picture of for instance the peace treaty between saudi arabia and yemen all those element fit into the way in which we be apply pressure to try to bring the situation to close thank the secretary of state for his statement and for his strong and robust determination to stop the attack on international shipping say well do secretary of state and let also say that we in the house or certainly most of we support the line that he be take do the secretary of state agree that the fact that pro hamas houthi site be celebrate the effect that the strike in the red sea be have on food and other supply chain send signal that the word speak and action take by this country our government and our ally be not yet have the desire effect what step will the secretary of state and our ally take not simply to prevent trade route difficulty from escalate already eye watering price but to send the clear message that we in the united kingdom be not afraid to use our strength and our intelligence to respond adequately and if necessary even more strongly the hon gentleman have make very worthwhile point it be clear that the houthis while perhaps no long able to act as they once do be not fully degraded there must surely come time when they understand that this be no long in their interest because we be work actively to intercept new supply as far as possible and they will continue to be degrade if they continue to act as they have in respect of commercial shipping and of course the royal navy there will eventually be conclusion to that but do not want to mislead the house by say that this be over because simply can not guarantee that for one moment so let make it clear again from this dispatch box that we will always have to keep the option open if it be not over disability action plan today and in british sign language for those watch on parliament live be delighted to deliver on the government commitment to transform the everyday life of disabled people across the country for the well we as government be work to make this country the most accessible place in the world for disabled people to live work and thrive and today be proud to announce another important milestone the

intention to develop new disability action plan to set out the practical immediate action that ministers across government will take to improve disabled people daily life follow that my department and the disability unit do huge amount of work and thank everyone involve since come into the role have spend time listen engage and continue to ensure that the voice of disabled people be properly hear as that be an important priority for the government that be why in july we consult on the draft disability action plan set out range of proposal where we feel we could take immediate action or lie the foundation for long term change we rightly want to give everyone and most importantly disabled people disabled people organisation and other key charity and stakeholder the chance to have their say on the draft plan the consultation run for week and be immensely grateful to every single person who take the time to respond in the consultation we set out area for action each area propose how the disability unit together with my department other government departments and partner would take action to drive improvement in those area since the consultation close in october we have be carefully work through more than response which pleasingly show broad support for almost all our proposal we have use these response along with feedback from series of event and discussion during the

cost of live support through help for households as well as the send and alternative provision improvement plan today new disability action plan be another vital pillar in improve disabled people everyday life work with disabled people and their representative organisation and with my colleague across government in my role as lead for the disability unit and chair of the cross government ministerial disability champion we will take immediate action now and in the come month to achieve real tangible improvement for disabled people to help to deliver on their need and to change disabled people daily live for the well commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of her statement the government have have consultation after consultation and they have publish different strategy but it sadly remain the case that we have have nothing that actually deliver well life for disabled people the conservative party manifesto promise to deliver national strategy for disabled people before the end of it claim this would be an ambitious strategy to support disabled people in all aspect and phase of their life what have we actually see the government finally launch their disability survey in january and it close in april at the start of the pandemic disabled people be disproportionately affect by covid account for six in death they struggle to access food personal protective equipment and social care and many be shield the question we must ask be why national strategy for disabled people be not publish until july in the summer recess with no chance for parliamentary scrutiny be grateful to have the opportunity to respond to the minister today the disability action plan contain some positive it attempt to address some of the well know barrier that disable people continue to face through measure such as tackle guide dog refusal raise the profile of assistive technology and increase support for disabled people to take part in politic there be also commitment to british sign language interpretation at all no press conference which many will remember that have argue for on numerous occasion it be about time do not think any member would argue that those be not important issue that the government can and should look at but there be one glaringly obvious issue that the action plan fail to address the top concern for disabled people now be the cost of live crisis not my assumption but what disabled people be tell and what charity be find on the ground survey carry out by sense find that of people with complex disability be worried about the rise cost of living the royal national institute of blind people note in its initial analysis of the plan that it disappoint there no mention of any support measure to address the rise cost of living scope the disability equality charity have calculate that on average disabled household face extra cost of per month to have the same standard of living as non disabled household energy bill for example remain high which make day to day live very expensive for those who rely on specialist medical equipment or need to heat their home more than the average household the government have make two disability cost of live payment of but many disabled people have tell those barely touch the side with many lose their warm home discount at the same time the situation be exacerbate by the fact that our current social security system put disabled people through multiple upsetting and dehumanising assessment they be deny their legal entitlement far too often unless they have the strength and support to go through the appeal process the government white paper publish last year cause huge amount of concern by propose to scrap the work capability assessment leave disabled people reliant on the flawed personal independence payment assessment the disability action plan do nothing to improve the assessment process without address those fundamental problem the action outline in the plan feel like little more than tinker around the edge disabled people need proper action that deal with all the societal barrier that make their life challenging may say that the government could have start by reinstate the minister for disabled people role to minister of state level thank the hon lady for what think be warm welcome in there somewhere indicate dissent not so much she say so there we go reiterate that the disability action plan be not just another consultation but real tangible action to change people daily life with practical action across different report february vol correction it be about build society that work for everyone the hon member for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft be right to point out that day to day life be too difficult for disabled people and their family agree with she that be why we have take the opportunity we can take in this round alongside the wide national disability strategy would love to boil the ocean and to have fix everything in the month or so have be in the role but assure hon member that irrespective of the perceive level of the role have the convene power and support across government be delighted that the hon lady keep push for my elevation but under the previous labour administration the minister for disabled people be an under secretary of state be extremely proud to be an under secretary of state very good one thank you will take that under our government the role have be mix which do not mean that we do not take it seriously take it extremely seriously have come to the role with my own personal experience of live with my father who become disabled and live under the court of protection when be grow up my mum work with disabled adult get they into work she be an early part of the riding for the disabled association and the special olympics movement no matter what rank have in the government bring that experience and interest to the role say to people watch that the pay cheque or the rank simply do not matter be in this for they the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for derby north amanda solloway and have meet to discuss the point make by the hon member for lewisham deptford about the cost of energy my hon friend be disability champion across government as be so we will continue to engage reiterate that the cost of living payment will start again tomorrow some million people across the uk have be able to claim an extra in addition to their disability benefit as the hon lady mention it be of course challenging time for everybody we put in place the furlough scheme and the other support for business and community across the country to try to keep people on their foot between and we provide billion to help people with the cost of living to anybody who have disability health condition or any other need say please look at the benefit calculator on they should look at the household support fund which run for full year whole six month long than the previous one there be huge amount of interest in it so urge people to contact their local authority about it be delighted that many people with caring responsibility and those look after disabled people have be help in this way finally the help to claim service be there as well provide by the dwp work with citizens advice to make sure that those in need do not have to worry because the government both locally and nationally be there for they call the chair of the women and equalities committee be sure that as an ambassador for the special olympics my constituent the great lawrie mcmenemy will welcome the announcement that my hon friend have just make specifically she have announce practical action across separate area that give an idea of the scale of the challenge when it come to co ordination and accountability there be disability champion across every government department and of course there be the disability unit in the cabinet office how will she make sure that the challenge of co ordination be successfully meet so that my constituent and each member in this house will know who to turn to and who to hold accountable if those practical action be not deliver thank my right hon friend for her point about the special olympics when be sports minister have the honour of meet her constituent share his passion for very important movement it be potentially life change which be why be delighted that it be in this plan my right hon friend ask about the evidence and datum around the disability action plan the plan be there to improve the quality of government hold datum and to increase insight into the need and barrier that affect disabled people daily life ultimately we will evaluate the impact of these policy and service and we will use datum when they be available to monitor and assess the outcome of the plan we will start work on develop more comprehensive evaluation know that through her role as the chair of the select committee she will absolutely measure and my role in this assure she the house and all those watch that the plan be absolutely about learn and deliver on this challenge call the snp spokesperson thank the minister for prior sight of her statement this disability action plan be not plan it be mishmash of short term policy some of the proposal be welcome and should have be sort out long ago other be unclear and simply do not address the most pressing concern of disabled people in my submission to the dap consultation list key area that have be overlook cost of living and welfare support be still miss even though these area be consistently raise by disability organisation and individual the minister say that the government will improve understanding of the cost of live for disabled people what well understanding do they need for the past two year disabled people have be cry out for more target financial support to assist with their additional cost of living need the minister say that the government will promote well understanding of the united nations convention on the right of person with disability across government what do that actually mean in the uk government be find to have systematically fail disabled people that be still happen the work capability assessment reform will subject more disabled people to the cruel punitive and ineffective sanction regime why if the government be serious about improve the life of those with disability they should start by scrap the proposal ahead of the march budget how much of this plan will actually be enact before the general election in contrast the scottish government be act within budgetary constraint to improve the life of disabled people through the adult disability payment and child disability payment the independent living fund with an initial investment of up to million will enable people with disability to improve their life finally no offence but the downgrading of the role of minister for disability indicate this government disregard for people with disability thank the hon lady for her response be glad that advanced sight of the statement be welcome at least reiterate to those watch that this plan be one pillar of the work that we be do across all government departments to help disabled people to succeed and to make this the most accessible place to live work and thrive the work capability assessment will be change my engagement so far have be very much about what disabled people feel be in aberdeen on thursday chat to some of our claimant and those work with local charity many of those disabled people be so frustrated that they can not get chance to work and to try thing the action plan be not about punitive sanction it be about give disabled people the opportunity to take part in wide daily life which we all take for grant point she to the cost of live support and the around million in barnett consequential for her government have consistently ask where the money be go and how they be spend it would love to have point that out to those meet on thursday this issue be not about party political barneying in this chamber the hon lady and share the view that it be about support disabled people in their daily life strongly believe that these measure will change their daily life we will report in six month if she know more than and the next election be before that then it will not be do so and in month of course she and will continue to discuss these matter until the election be sure that where we can work together we will draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests in respect of charity to do with deaf people and cancer welcome my hon friend to her post know from many year of work with she that she be very capable minister who will take the job extremely seriously and give it she all disabled people have tell very clearly that they need senior serious voice in government will she say little more about how she will be that voice and how she will listen to disabled people and reflect their need inside government also to echo my right hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes the chair of the women and equalities committee press the minister to say little more about how she will ensure that disabled people issue of accessibility be not an afterthought in government but be put first so that inclusion be by design and important aim be all achieve thank my right hon friend for her kind word and for her incredible impeccable support she take the british sign language act through parliament and thank she for the work that she have do in my department and her continue interest in these matter fundamentally the disability action plan be about disabled people daily life and their need not be an afterthought in any part of government will be honest come into this role find get message out extremely challenging will take that forward by promote accessible communication monitor standard and training and ensure full inclusion the hon member for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft mention the no downing street briefing it be so important that everybody know the central message everyone need to be include that be why one of the action come down to local resilience forum and have the right engagement at local level in time of need be sure that my right hon friend the member for norwich north chloe smith will welcome that too call the chair of the work and pensions committee the select committee call for review of the underperforming disability confident scheme that review be delay by the pandemic but in october we be tell that official be refine the recommendation can the minister tell we what the plan say about disability confident and do it hold out the prospect of short waiting time for access to work it be remiss of not to reply just now to the point raise by my right hon friend the member for norwich north chloe smith about the strong voice across government that is of course the secretary of state who sit in the cabinet and work alongside to represent disabled people voice to respond to the chair of the select committee access to work grant which help with extra cost beyond standard reasonable adjustment be important for my department as we smash the employment goal and try to do more on disability employment he be right to ask about that and to challenge disability confident it be not just nice thing that company put on their website it need to deliver change for disabled people in the workplace we will look at the disability employment goal be look at access to work and will look at disability confident just as the select committee have do urge he to watch this space welcome these proposal and thank the fantastic disability unit team and the stakeholder who have help to shape they in particular the proposal on accessible play park have be work with organisation such as benjamin smile and mums on mission both in my constituency swindon be lead by example when it come to make sure that child play park be accessible to all and hopefully we can make that give across the whole country one of the key point of the national disability strategy be that there would be an annual review so that we could be hold to account on what we achieve and where we need to work hard it would also allow we to set out the next range of ambitious target co ordinated by the minister through the departmental disability champion can have assurance that good as these proposal be we will review they on an annual basis as well as have new fresh set also join the call to see my hon friend make minister of state because if she be to co ordinate effort across government in area beyond her direct influence she need to have that gravita in that room so that she can demand what be need to remove barrier for disabled people be grateful to my hon friend for his experience and insight have meet the ministerial disability champion already to ensure that disability inclusion be priority and be ultimately deliver in their departments work that they continue to be accountable for their contribution to the development and delivery of the national disability strategy and the disability action plan and that they continue to show their commitment to disabled people by create opportunity protect their right and ensure action on everything that we have speak about today in term of contribution to society on make playground more accessible and my hon friend impeccable work in his constituency there be lot of information on disability inclusion in organise sport physical activity and exercise but information on make playground accessible be unfortunately not easily available we want to make it available work with the partner he mention and achieve good practice among local authority that will be part of this plan and we will measure its delivery in six month and month have huge regard for the minister but gently say to she that we must recognise the context of this disability action plan between and the equivalent of billion be cut from working age people predominantly disabled people individually they lose thousand of pound every year as my hon friend the member for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft point out the joseph rowntree foundation uk poverty report identify that disabled people have be disproportionately impact by that and be likely to suffer deep poverty and destitution on the government commitment hope that the minister can reassure it be approach two year since the equality and human rights commission find that the department be discriminate against disabled people and issue section notice and we still have hear nothing from the department on that could the minister reassure we that it will publish something on that in the next few week and certainly before the second anniversary of that notice thank the hon lady for her point know that she have long be push for response and will write to she further on that matter as say to the hon member for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft there have be substantial cost of live support but understand the point about disability cost that have be make today again point people towards the household support fund which be there for exactly those additional cost in fact we be do research and evaluation on where that support be go and it be make difference to people daily life want those people to know that beyond the cost of living payment which start again tomorrow further support be available through their local authority or from devolve money welcome the disability action plan it follow the british sign language act and the down syndrome act which have support million more disabled people into work as well as the cost of live disability payment which begin tomorrow will be hold disability forum in my home county of rutland on june where will bring together people live with disability and their family and carer so that we can create plan for our county will my hon friend who have bring such strength and passion to her role share what support might be available to help roll out such action plan at local level thank my hon friend for make that important point something announce here in westminster might sound great but what do it mean in rutland and beyond that be an important part of the next step of course we have support in our jobcentre with further work coach support and disability employment adviser offer advice and expertise and have mention access to work disability confident and our future employment goal if she send an invite would be delighted to listen in on what her constituent and those advocate would like to hear and understand note that the minister mention in her statement the aim to promote well understanding across government of the united nations convention on the right of person with disability which be very welcome how exactly will she do that with each department both in their role as employer of large number of people around the country and in the policy that they promote such as disability benefit include those relate to mental health and the provision of housing for people with disability if she find that the departments be not come up to the mark in achieve what she want of they how will she ensure that they be force to carry out her policy to ensure that there be real equality for people with disability in our society the right hon gentleman make an important point about cross government work and deliver on the action plan stress to he and to those watch that the plan be one pillar of the work that we be do we will for example work to increase disability inclusive approach to emergency and resilience planning and climate adaption through work strategically with team on that we will always work with the department for environment food and rural affairs and the foreign commonwealth and development office to ensure that disability inclusion be increase as have say it be increasingly vital that ministerial champion deliver and be accountable in their departments that be what will be do it will mean that disabled people can benefit from everything that government and community do and can rightly contribute to every aspect of our society welcome my hon friend statement be particularly pleased about the aim to help our business of all size and sector to understand the need of and deliver improvement for disabled people one group of people who feel that they should be recognise in disability plan be those with advanced endometriosis in debate that lead on endometriosis in the workplace we hear that some of the issue that woman face at that advanced stage be really disability but because they be not list as such many woman lose their job owe to poor attendance through sick day and so on very much welcome the strategy but will my hon friend consider expand it to those woman health issue that be totally disable thank my right hon friend for his question research show that disabled people be more likely to experience difficulty and barrier in access product and service which result in lack of confidence whether that be on the high street in go to work or elsewhere the consultation propose voluntary accreditation scheme for business to train their staff in disability awareness the benefit to business be absolutely clear purple say that the spending power of disabled household be billion year as my right hon friend know lead on woman health and on the wide issue of keep woman in the workforce within the department for work and pensions the debilitate impact of the menopause and the wide impact of menstruation in the oil and gas sector for example be issue raise in aberdeen just last week which link into our woman health strategy this be the second time that endometriosis have be mention in the chamber recently would be happy to meet my right hon friend and other to discuss how we link it into our understanding there be much to welcome in the plan but there be also few thing that be miss one specific thing that the minister have include in her area for action be help business of all size and sector to understand the need of and deliver improvement for disabled people one of my constituent come to recently because as user of an electric wheelchair she have find it almost impossible to know what business specifically hotel mean by accessible it mean something different to every business wheelchair user can find themselves go into business and then be unable to move around if they be in hotel they can get to their hotel room but can not move around within that room can the minister tell we whether the government be go to take action to set out exactly what be need if business be go to use the term accessible thank the hon lady for make that point which also apply to business recruitment they talk about recruit differently and they want to do so but then they regress that tend to be due to lack of understanding the disability unit will work to well define what business need to do build on the main issue raise in the consultation response that work will also look at evidence gap at where exist scheme be already do thing and there may be duplication and as the hon lady say and as describe early at where people think they be do the right thing but it do not match the reality of the experience for disabled people use service or have day out or night away that be part of the work cover by action and in the plan and would be delighted to hear from the hon lady what that mean to her constituent welcome the disability action plan the minister mention the cost of living wonder what more could be do to speed up the transition to personal independence payment for those live on disability living allowance one of my constituent have just wait over year for that transition to take place welcome the fact that access to playground be in the action plan but follow on from the question ask by my hon friend the member for north swindon justin tomlinson and the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn what more can be do to ensure that these point be deliver both at local government level perhaps by make it statutory responsibility for local council to provide at least minimum level of disability access for some play area and playground and at national level what cross departmental committee or working be the minister already involve with thank my right hon friend for make some really pertinent point in regard to his point about playground that be why there will be portal and some good practice some local authority be already deliver other will be able to learn from those intervention so that family can enjoy play together in the way that everybody else would take for grant that should be available in every community my right hon friend also mention the wide structural change be happy to look at the specific case he raise if he would kindly send the detail would be very grateful this plan be part of the wide national disability strategy include change to the work capability assessment the engagement have have with disabled people and their organisation have make clear that there be some very vulnerable people who be very keen to be protect and support and there be other group who be very keen to get the opportunity and chance they need this government be determined to get the approach right for everybody and every community accord to the charity sense of people with complex disability be worried about the rise cost of living the minister predecessor say that the disability action plan would outline the immediate action this government would take to make the life of disabled people well so why do the disability action plan do so little to address the cost of living crisis now would point the hon gentleman to the next stage of the cost of living payment which start tomorrow and again to the household support fund which we see evidentially be support carer and those with disability at really difficult time we have ensure the energy price guarantee remain in place as an additional safety net until march this year it will hold bill down and hope as energy price fall it will help low pay worker or disabled people as he describe the government be provide million of household with further cost of living payment as say and there be billion package to support household until be engage with the other disability champion the under

northern ireland and which be not clear in the action plan help to insulate home to aid with energy cost for those who need health relate upgrade or ongoing help with energy cost rather than one off bonus payment what consideration have the government give to the issue of warm home for our disabled constituent something that they do not necessarily have write to counterpart in northern ireland

usual he make pertinent point about ensure that everybody have that warm home and that support this be of course devolve in slightly different way in his community but be happy to share the detail with he the truth be that disabled people have be at the sharp end of this government cruel policy their austerity and their attack on social security and public service disabled people be also among the hard hit by the cost of living crisis but this disability action plan fail to introduce the emergency measure demand by disabled people to directly address the crisis never mind the decade of attack they have face be that the case do not appreciate the excuse the hon gentleman seem to be distract as be say do not understand his characterisation there be action over the next month in different area where we have listen and engage with disabled people we have hear what they want and those action be in parallel with our national disability strategy his be exactly the kind of government be against you and not support make disabled people feel more isolated and concerned for their welfare want to say squarely to people listen today that we have an absolute focus on what we can do to make sure that disabled people daily life be well and that there be support and help there for they this be one of the pillar of support that this government be absolutely committed to when he read the full plan he will see that it will make disabled people daily live well and that be what this government be determined to deliver thank the minister and those on the opposition front bench for their presence point of order on point of order mr deputy speaker it be report today that the prime minister and piers morgan have make bet surely contest in which it be shame there have to be

might be rather full the right hon gentleman will understand that that be nice try but not matter for the chair finance bill ways and means motion make and question propose that provision may be make for the electricity generator levy not to apply to new generating huddleston call the snp spokesperson rise to speak about the procedure be use here this motion be very odd and worryingly symptomatic of government avoid their responsibility to this house give that they could have table an amendment of the law resolution which would have allow they to add their new clause to the debate today

to the government aim be to grow the economy for the good of everyone and our tax system be key part of that for household high taxis mean less financial freedom and less choice in how they spend their money for business they can mean less growth and investment and that mean few job for worker that be why we need to grow our economy to create job and give ourselves the financial headroom to reduce taxis and remove the barrier to private sector investment we must have tax system that be supportive of business at spring budget the chancellor set out his approach for highly competitive business tax regime by announce generous tax incentive combine with rate of corporation tax that remain the low in the the government ensure that the uk be one of the good place in the world for business to grow and invest but we should not be satisfied with simply be one of the good this bill therefore mark our next step in make the uk the good place in the world to do business we be take huge ambitious step to make that reality in the autumn statement and in the bill for example no other major economy have make full expensing permanent that be major step in encourage more investment by give huge tax relief to those who invest alongside that we have introduce generous new regime for research and development carry out by company we be now go far to encourage even more investment by introduce new clause which will exempt receipt from new electricity generating project from the electricity generator levy will address each amendment in turn look first at the detail of new clause the electricity generator levy be introduce follow the energy crisis to ensure that energy company with extraordinary return contribute more towards vital public service and support for household however we must balance that against ensure that the uk remain brilliant place to invest in renewable the new clause make change to the egl that will exempt receipt from new electricity generating

decision to go ahead with project on or after november the date of the autumn statement that will help support continue investment in the uk renewable generation capacity by remove new investment from the tax and provide business with the confidence to make such new investment turn to government amendment to to ensure that the research and development tax relief clause in the bill work as intend the government be propose technical amendment to the clause the bill introduce new enhance support for intensive small and medium sized enterprise such as those in our vital life science sector from april the intensity threshold will be reduce from to amendment and make change to ensure that intensive company get the relief as intend amendment remove two situation where company would appear less intensive than it actually be these issue be raise with we by an industry stakeholder for which be grateful to avoid abuse and to protect the scheme for genuinely intensive company the ratio be work out at group level currently in the legislation company within group that charge each other for service could have cost double count and therefore reduce their intensity the amendment will fix that the government do not want to exclude company from relief because of legitimate commercial arrangement that do not affect the underlie true intensity of the business on top of provide more support for intensive company the bill will simplify and improve our relief by merge the sme scheme with the expenditure credit to ensure that those clause work as intend the government propose technical amendment to the clause company and accountant want the merged scheme to be implement on an accountancy period basis as that make claim simple and delay the merged scheme for the majority of current expenditure credit claimant it therefore give they bit more time to prepare the new rule for contract out will ensure that the company make the decision to do the and bear the risk be the one that get the relief however that mean that as currently draft there could be temporary situation when two company be in contractual relationship and one move into the new tax credit system ahead of the other for limited period of time that could result in situation where both party could claim on the same or neither could claim as be raise by stakeholder amendment ensure that the legislation work as intend for temporary double claim the credit will go to the claimant in the old system until both have start new accounting period to avoid temporary gap where no company can claim the legislation will be amend to ensure that subcontractor can claim where their customer be still in the old system want to clarify the definition of contract out as some stakeholder have be concern that the legislation allow company to claim for contract as if it merely think that will take place that be not the case the word contemplating have be deliberately use because in legal term it mean that the company will know that specific action be be consider plan and require for the to take place rather than just generally think that it will take place the government will publish update guidance for comment this week to help company understand the new rule the bill have package of groundbreake reform to relief for the creative industry amendment to ensure that claim for the creative industry tax relief be submit with the require information to effectively administer the relief while remove potential disadvantage for company the government be legislate in the bill to introduce an additional information requirement for claim to the creative relief company will have to provide additional information to support their claim which will help protect the relief from fraud and error as the legislation be currently draft claim be invalid if the require information be not provide where that information relate to connect party transaction his majesty revenue and customs can not verify that it be complete and correct at the point the claim be submit if it be discover at later date that require information relate to connect party transaction be omit that would lead to the whole claim be treat as invalid and no relief be grant company may then be out of time to resubmit its claim to prevent company from be disadvantaged in this way the amendment fix the additional information requirement to allow hmrc to specify the consequence of failure to provide information in regulation that will ensure that entire claim be not automatically invalidate in case where the claimant company have not provide hmrc with all the information relate to its connected party transaction within the time limit have outline the case for each of the government amendment and therefore urge the house to accept they in speak to new clause which relate to permanent full expensing remind the house of the context in which this finance bill be publish it follow the chancellor statement on november last year in which he claim that he be deliver an autumn statement for growth member will remember however that the same day the office for budget responsibility confirm that growth forecast have be cut by more than half for the come year cut again for the year after that and cut yet again for the year after that independent analyst confirm that even after all the change that the government have announce personal taxis would still rise they be set to rise by per household by with the tax burden on track to be the high since the second world war that be the context in which this bill be publish flatline wage high taxis high mortgage payment and worsen public service all the product of year of conservative economic failure our country need change critical part of make that change will be to get our country growth rate up we need plan for growth to make people across britain well off and to ensure sustainable funding for our public service labour have be develop our plan for growth by work hand in hand with business across the country and across the economy we know how highly business that be consider invest in the uk rate stability predictability and long term plan for that reason we welcome the fact that as our new clause highlight the bill make full expensing permanent permanent full expensing be something we have long call for as policy that can support great business investment and economic growth because labour know how important stability and predictability be to business the shadow chancellor my right hon friend the member for leeds west rachel reeves announce last week that labour be committed to maintain permanent full expensing in the uk tax system as well as the annual investment allowance if we win the next general election the shadow chancellor have make this commitment to offer business certainty for the year ahead business consider plant and machinery investment across britain can be confident that the tax treatment of that investment would not change with labour government of course there be still general election to face so use this opportunity to invite the minister to put on the record whether the conservatives will follow our lead by confirm that should they win the general election they will maintain permanent full expensing be sure many business would welcome the certainty that would come from know both the main party be go into the election fully commit to keep permanent full expensing urge the minister when he respond to confirm whether that will be his party policy go into the general election after all the chopping and change we have see in capital allowance in recent year the minister need to make the commitment explicit as mention during early stage of the bill the annual investment allowance have be temporarily raise to million when this parliament begin that temporary basis be extend by the finance act again by the finance act and then make permanent by the finance no act meanwhile over the course of this parliament the super deduction come and go last year full expensing for expenditure on plant and machinery be introduce on temporary basis for three year in this bill the government be finally make it permanent after so much instability commitment from treasury ministers at the dispatch box that the conservatives like labour will commit to maintain permanent full expensing feel like the least they can do our new clause would require the chancellor to publish not only an assessment of the impact of permanent full expensing but consideration of what other policy would support its effectiveness we believe this be important to ensure that business investment be support as much as possible the opposition have begin to set out what some of our policy would be if we win the next general election as the shadow chancellor have set out if we be in government we would consider the outcome of technical consultation on whether lease asset can be include in full expensing and on simplify the uk capital allowance regime would be grateful if the minister update we on the progress of those consultation last week the shadow chancellor also make clear the commitment that if labour win the next general election we will ask hmrc to produce simple and comprehensive guidance make clear which asset be eligible for each type of capital allowance that guidance would give business clarity over how their investment will be treat and business will be able to use it as single point of reference when make investment decision will the minister confirm whether the government have consider take such step or make such commitment to give further certainty the shadow chancellor have also say that in government labour would explore the great use of ruling and clearance under such an approach business would be able to get write ruling from hmrc about the tax treatment of potential investment make clear for instance whether they qualify for full expensing or other capital allowance we know that business benefit from other country tax administrator be able to provide such ruling and clearance as certainty be crucial to encourage investment in britain would be grateful if the minister confirm whether the treasury have ask hmrc to consider the great use of ruling and clearance for investment and if so what its conclusion have be of course any policy on expense or other capital allowance sit under the headline rate of corporation tax it be hard to conclude anything other than that the conservative party be rather unclear and confused about its approach to corporation tax rate in the uk for evidence of that we need look no far than the current chancellor in july during his leadership bid he pledge to cut the headline rate of corporation tax from to yet when he become chancellor just three month later one of his first act be to promise to raise the tax instead from to it be no wonder that business and indeed conservative back benchers find it so hard to understand the conservatives policy on corporation tax rate let be clear about the certainty we would offer if we win the next general election as the shadow chancellor have set out we believe the current rate of strike the right balance between what our public finance need and as the low rate in the keep our corporation tax competitive in the global economy that be why we be pledge to cap the headline rate of corporation tax at its current rate of for the whole of the next parliament we would take action if tax change in other advanced economy threaten to undermine uk competitiveness that choice provide predictability and have clear rationale that be the pro business choice and the pro growth choice the promise to cap corporation tax at be clear from we again to offer business as much certainty as possible will the conservatives follow our lead and also pledge today to cap corporation tax at for the next parliament these commitment to cap corporation tax to maintain permanent full expensing and to keep the annual investment allowance will all form part of the road map that we would publish in the first six month of labour government set out our tax plan for business for the whole of that parliament that would put stability predictability and long term plan at the heart of our approach to give business as much certainty as possible would be grateful if the minister confirm whether corporation tax cap at and keep full expensing in place will be in the conservative party manifesto too be interested in what the shadow minister be say about what would happen if other country change their corporation tax as he will know mr trump the former president have say that he would cut us corporation tax potentially from to give such example do the hon gentleman anticipate that labour government would look to cut the headline rate of corporation tax as we would be look at significant tax cut by the world large economy thank the hon gentleman for his intervention as we have make clear we would take action if tax change in other advanced economy threaten to undermine uk competitiveness but the headline commitment from we be to cap corporation tax at for the duration of the next parliament recall that in early consideration in this debate he and have an exchange about permanent full expensing so hope he will welcome our commitment to maintain permanent full expensing if we be in government perhaps he will put pressure on his front bench colleague to join we today in make that cross party commitment from the house new clause focus on the multiplier use to calculate high rate of air passenger duty as we have discuss at early stage of the consideration of this bill clause make no change to band rate while in band the reduced standard and high rate will increase by and respectively in band the reduced standard and high rate will rise by and respectively in each of those three band which cover international travel to range of destination simple principle be follow if the duty for passenger on economy flight go up the duty for those fly business class and by private jet go up too in the domestic band however which cover flight within the uk that simple principle of fairness do not apply instead under the bill for domestic uk flight the reduced rate of apd rise by and the standard rate rise by yet the high rate be unchanged let be clear what this mean in plain english from april passenger fly economy and business class within the uk will see their taxis rise whereas passenger take exactly the same flight by private jet will enjoy tax freeze although the change kick in on april this be no april fool day joke although the prime minister may be laugh it be the result of hidden loophole that that the conservatives have introduce we discuss this matter in committee when the exchequer secretary try to provide an explanation for this unfairness he say that apd rate be uprate by forecast of rpi and those rate be then round to the near pound as for the different rate highlight in committee he say it largely depend on how they the rate be rounded to the near pound the actual rate be determine by whether the figure be round down or up official report finance public bill committee january know that the exchequer secretary always try to give straight answer let put it on the record that genuinely appreciate his effort to do so but fear that his explanation in committee may have be unintentionally misleading or at the very least only partial since that committee stage the house of commons library have give information confirm that it do not tell the full picture to say that the duty rate be as the minister claim uprate by forecast of rpi and those rate be then round to the near pound official report finance public bill committee january in fact my understanding be that the minister statement apply only to the reduce rate of air passenger duty those be indeed adjust each year in line with forecast rpi and round to the near pound however the standard and high rate be not calculate by separate reference to rpi rather they be generally set as multiplier of their respective reduce rate for instance the standard and high rate in band be set as and time the band reduce rate respectively round in both case to the near pound the use of multiplier within band would at least mean that if the reduce rate go up in any particular band the high rate should go up too and there would be sense of fairness to the system the problem be that that be not the case because there be loophole that apply to the rate in the domestic band the loophole mean that the high rate in the domestic band be not link by way of multipli to the reduce rate in that band but rather be link to the reduce rate in band and be equal to the high rate in that band realise that some of these calculation be complex and the terminology run the risk of be confuse so again let be clear about what this mean in plain english for international flight when the rate of duty for economy class passenger go up the rate of duty for private jet passenger go up too if that have be true for domestic flight then this year the rate of duty for private jet passenger would be go up follow the rise in the economy rate however the loophole mean that this link do not exist so this year duty be go up for passenger fly economy class within the uk and be freeze for those fly by private jet our new clause would require the government to consider and respond to option for close that loophole it would require the government to review the multiplier use to calculate air passenger duty rate and to consider option for introduce multipli to link the high and reduce rate within the domestic band take that course of action would close the domestic flight loophole that will see private jet passenger benefit from tax freeze this year while everyone else fly economy and business class see tax rise very much hope that the government will accept both our new clause they will ensure that minister consider the loophole in air passenger duty that have give private jet passenger tax freeze while everyone else be pay more and consider what else be need to make permanent full expensing as effective as possible we believe that the government must do all that they can to provide stable and predictable environment that encourage business investment and boost economic growth during this debate have set out our approach to provide that stability and predictability include our commitment to cap corporation tax at for the whole of the next parliament if we win the general election and to maintain permanent full expensing in the interest of give business as much certainty as possible urge the minister to say whether the conservatives will join we by go into the general election with both those commitment from his party too have declare my business interest in the register of members financial interests rise to support the government new clause think it be good that they be consider what more they can do to promote investment in the united kingdom generating capacity we import far too much power already especially when the sun do not shine and the wind do not blow and on the basis of the government ambitious forecast and target for much more of our energy to be deliver by electricity think that the position will get lot bad quite quickly anything that the government can do to encourage that additional investment in generate plant will be very welcome we will of course need similar positive approach to grid and cable because the more we electrify the more we will need to convey that power from the rather remote location where much of it come from to the part of the country that will need it so my only worry about new clause be that be not sure it go far enough think it be helpful in this limited number of case but trust that the chancellor when it come to the budget quite soon on march will consider that the new clause be just stepping stone and that we need to review again the very large tax imposition on energy of all kind in this country we now have double corporation tax in many case and range of windfall taxis that be often not really windfall taxis because they do not come off when the price go down although they be put on when the price be go up that whole area need considerable review because we need to take seriously the fact that we be short of energy overall we be short of electricity generating capacity and short of the mean to route power from generation to use and it would be an important stimulus for the british economy if we produce more of our own energy and generate more of our own electricity and if we be think about have surplus to export again instead of all too often be cruelly reliant upon import of liquid natural gas and electricity particularly from the continent would also like briefly to refer to new clause and they be wide range new clause that invite the government to make assessment or review of feature of this legislation but they also wish to broaden it out to get the government to review the impact of their general fiscal strategy on equality on investment on the state of the corporate sector and on inequality in our society be quite sure that the government will be review all those thing as matter of course as this be often continuous process indeed many of the item cover in this request for special review be already report on and form part of the normal process of policy preparation and rightly so if the minister be to tell that he would be grateful if do not vote for these new clause would have no problem with that be not sure that it would help to embody they in the legislation anyway think it would be bit of an abuse of the legislation but the government need to respond to the general thirst for knowledge that these new clause represent and to understand that there be some serious issue here that need to be return to trust that the chancellor will return to they at the budget look at the fiscal impact that these new clause cover trust that in the preparation of the budget we will have analysis in the treasury of these particular measure which be still go through from the last time but also hope that the government will review the extraordinary loss of the bank of england think that they have already run up to billion in the current financial year these be loss that the treasury and therefore the taxpayer have to pay as they be incur and that be completely unacceptable it impose strain on the public account and on the treasury at time when we really do not need they and when we need that money for other purpose there be two simple measure that the bank could take to stem the magnitude of those loss first it should not be sell bond at big loss in the market the european central bank be not do this although it have similar problem with portfolio of very expensively acquire bond there be also the issue of the run loss on these holding where the bank of england be pay the full much enhanced short term interest rate follow its increase in it this now greatly exceed the revenue on the bond because the bank pay far too much for the bond and there be very low rate of interest on they those run loss be problem think the bank should look at what the european central bank be do in pay different interest rate on reserve hold under this system so that it do not have such large run loss can my right hon friend tell if have get this right in the commentary ahead of the budget we talk about wiggle room and the office for budget responsibility forecast and about billion or billion here and there but think hear he say that this matter be completely out of the control of the those on the treasury bench and this parliament that the governor of the bank of england could unilaterally decide to crystallise loss on whichever extent of bond he wish to and then put that loss into the calculation of the chancellor of the day and that the chancellor would then have to work around that in order to work out what the fiscal expenditure public expenditure and taxation would be be that actually the case it sound mightily undemocratic to that be an interesting point of debate but my understanding of the constitutional position be that it be not as bad as my hon friend be suggest because all the bond be acquire with the express permission of the then chancellor of the exchequer the bank of england website say that the bond portfolio be hold on behalf of the treasury successive chancellors of the exchequer begin with the labour chancellor who first undertake quantitative easing and carry on by successive conservative chancellors all sign an agreement with the bank to say that they would indemnify against loss so give that the government and this parliament empower the purchase of the bond and now take responsibility for any loss on they it seem perfectly reasonable for there to be proper conversation about whether we want to take the loss see nothing wrong with we here challenge the idea that uniquely among the big quantitative easing programme it be the bank of england that not only insist on sell the bond at big loss but get reimburse the ecb do not sell they in the market at big loss the federal reserve board sell they in the market at big loss but get no money back it simply put on its balance sheet that it have lose lot of money and take the view that as it be central bank it do not really matter if it lose lot of money because central bank create money and it be therefore not like normal commercial business so hope that ministers will look at this as part of the general assessment that be be invite by these new clause hope also that ministers will look at the expenditure item in the overall account cover by new clause on the public finance because there have be marked decline in public sector productivity in the year to it be quite without precedent in my experience of follow public finance over the year and this very sharp decline represent at least billion loss to our system in that it now cost at least billion year more to run the group of public service cover by these figure than it do before the collapse in productivity on top of that there have also be the need for much big sum to cover inflation this be not the inflation figure this be the real loss figure from the productivity we be all sympathetic to the difficulty that lockdown and the transition out of lockdown cause and there be bind to be disruption our public service be badly affect by that as child could not go to school and hospital be disrupt by covid but that be now some time behind we and it seem perplex that we can not get those public service back to level of productivity hear comment that maybe artificial intelligence will do it and that there need to be big investment in computer well that should be on top all that be say to the government be that we can surely get back to productivity level use technique from which be very much pre artificial intelligence and before the late round of computerisation again this be big area that need to be look at as part of any review of the public finance the third area which be also very large and very much in the news today be that even more people in our country do not feel they can go back to work and that they need help at home because they be no long able to work the government be work on some important programme through the department for work and pensions to show people that through combination of part time flexible working and work at home with proper support and training and maybe with additional financial support to help they they could go back to work for part of the time and make contribution we desperately need they and think their life would be more rewarding they would also be well off because we now have benefit system that mean it be always well to work this should be cross party matter because it be problem that our nation as whole face we can enrich those people life help to reduce the burden on the taxpayer and improve the net income of those concern again this involve many billion my point in make these three simple point apparent to the house be that there be very large sum of money indeed involve in bond loss and productivity which we need to review because that would help in the formation of the next budget it would create more headroom both for the tax cut that we need if we be to promote growth and for improved public service provision in the area where the shoe be still pinch trust that will be part of any review that might emerge from these new clause or from the spirit of these new clause hope that my right hon friend the chancellor be think about this as we will have budget hard on the heel of this finance bill which come out of the autumn statement in these condition of recovery and give the need for fast growth welcome have more than one budget year and the fact that we may have three fiscal event quite close to each other if all go well they must promote growth and reduce taxis and this be good start welcome new clause but can we please have more can we please look at the headroom that think have help to identify call the snp spokesperson be sure that the people suffer through the rampant cost of live crisis across the nation of the uk hop that if the government table new clause today it would address their struggle in pay their rent their ever increase mortgage their high food bill thank to brexit and their even high energy bill after the cap be adjust in january the government table only new clause and as say on the ways and means motion we have no opportunity to amend it the electricity generator levy disproportionately impact scotland renewable sector the snp welcome the fact that new clause will exempt new renewable project from the egl but as note by the chief executive of scottish renewables though the autumn statement introduce new measure such as the egl exemption they be not enough on their own we urgently need consistent policy to provide an environment which will enable business to invest at the scale need right now pledge to invest billion year in the green energy transition might be good thing but it seem to be off the table not only for the uk government but order wish to make short statement know the whole house will wish to join in express our sympathy with his majesty the king follow this evening announcement our thought be of course with his majesty and his family and we all send he our very good wish for his successful treatment and speedy recovery thank you mr speaker obviously it be entirely appropriate to have pause for that statement be unaware of the news bring to the chamber but it be clearly significant our thought be with the royal family at this time as be say we need consistent policy to help the renewable sector and we be not see that either from the tory government who have run out of idea or from the labour party which make promise and then duck responsibility for what be require we would have like new clause to flesh out the chancellor promise make in the autumn statement to take up to year for up to year off the electricity bill of people live near new generation equipment we have not hear that today so we do not know what scheme be come up as intimate early would have like to table an amendment on this point if new clause be applicable to people live next to new generation equipment what about those who already live among generation equipment in for example the highland and island we have the cold climate in the uk most people be off the gas grid so we have high average bill than the rest of the uk we pay the high standing charge for electricity more than here in london and because of uk government policy we have the high level of fuel poverty in the uk yet we export six time more electricity than we use in the highland it would have be entirely appropriate for the minister to agree to introduce highland energy rebate to put some of that contribution back into the pocket of people across the highland and island who be struggle because of those condition the hon gentleman be make very good point that ring true in my constituency too of course the problem be make more difficult still because of the other cost face by people live in our constituency such as delivery charge and the cost of other service even tube of toothpaste can cost little more the far away it be from the big urban centre that make the problem lot bad the hon gentleman be absolutely right and welcome his support for the campaign be try to start in order to get justice for people across the highland and island he mention other cost of course rural property be often large and less insulated that do not mean that people in those property have more money it just mean that their property be build that way century or decade ago that bring high cost many of the factor affect people across the highland and island could be mitigate by highland energy rebate new clause table by the hon member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams would require the chancellor to review the public health inequality and poverty effect of the bill and to publish report within six month of the bill be pass it be regrettable that it look as if the new clause will not be press to division tonight but the snp would have support it we believe that requirement to consider the implication for equality poverty and health should be include in every bill for which that would be relevant as say people be suffer from cost of live crisis fuel by decision make in this parliament mortgage be go up as direct result of the disastrous mini budget and now food cost be go up of course there be more to come as the brexit regulation kick in at the end of april not only be price go up but they will rise even high from may as business across the uk face more red tape of course we be already see our high energy bill ever meanwhile we be do what we can with our limited power in scotland we already have low council tax and of course we be introduce council tax freeze poll out today show that nearly of the public approve of this policy new clause would require the chancellor to publish an assessment of the bill impact on investment and growth and of the impact of make full expensing permanent and to consider what other policy could support the effectiveness of permanent full expensing give that full expensing be expect to cost billion to billion year after an initial billion year for the first three year the policy deserve some scrutiny since full expensing be announce in the autumn statement the snp have support its be make permanent as this would give business great certainty and would simplify the tax system however it be vital that member be fully inform so that this parliament can assess the effectiveness of this policy and whether it encourage investment in asset such as plant and machinery as it be design to do or whether that be at the expense of other form of investment full expensing be rare point in the autumn statement on which we agree but as have say time and again the bill have fail people be struggle through cost of living crisis and they want to know what help they will get now while they be struggle because their household expense be go through the roof people want investment in clean energy and just transition from oil and gas we will need oil and gas for period but that transition should be safeguard the united states be provide hundred of billion of dollar in initial support for new green technology such as hydrogen the european union have make similar high level investment yet the uk government and the labour party be dawdle on the issue waste the opportunity for we to lead across the world like so many bills this bill ignore the need of the people of scotland so it be little wonder that they be on the inevitable path to independence order may take this opportunity to associate myself with mr speaker remark be sure that all our thought be with king charles and the royal family this evening associate myself with your remark mr deputy speaker and those of the speaker and wish his majesty speedy recovery it be interesting to take part in such debate it be disappointing to hear labour describe itself as the pro business party give that it be ask business to increase wage recognise union accept collective bargaining and restrict labour flexibility as well as increase bureaucracy and tell business where to invest to that be wolf in sheep clothing turn to the bill and the amendment it be extraordinary to hear the spokespeople on both opposition front benches talk about expense become permanent that be exactly what the bill intend to do the minute we get royal assent expensing will be permanent on second reading the minister say it would be permanent and as soon as the bill be enact that will be in place and on the statute book which be welcome amendment and make point about full expensing those amendment will ensure that the uk plant and machinery capital allowance will increase and there will be tax cut of about billion year which will help to drive up growth across the whole united kingdom specifically in our manufacturing sector from the point of view of those in south devon that tax cut be worth have it will help to drive growth and attract investment and innovation across the country not just in the industrial heartland we speak about so often there be often international comparison make on research and development amendment offer we the opportunity to drive innovation and economic growth merge the research and development expenditure credit scheme and the small and medium enterprise research and development relief scheme achieve that rare thing that we so often fail to do in government simplify the tax code and provide great support for uk firm we should all welcome that it be worth state the impact of the change in the bill that will support loss make small and medium sized enterprise by reduce the intensity threshold by from to that be expect to help further sme and they will receive per of qualify research and development funding invest that be an extraordinary amount of support in the region of million year by and it will be welcome by small business across the country the bill also extend the sunset clause until april for two more programme the enterprise investment scheme and the venture capital trust which be welcome clause and outline support for the creative sector one of our unsung success story be how well the uk creative industry have do because of this government extraordinary tax cut which have help tv film music and video game thrive in this country between and that industry have grow by an extraordinary one and half time create thousand of job across the country and attract million if not billion of pound of investment and spur on growth that set the benchmark as government we need to help all industry not just the creative industry by reduce the tax burden and ensure we can find way to support they make plug for the tourism and hospitality sector which the minister know often mention in the future hope we will be able to do the same for the tourism and hospitality sector as we have do for the creative industry through vat reduction support the government amendment to the bill welcome the intent of this finance bill which be help to ensure that work pay ensure that the tax burden for business be go down and create landscape that will attract the investment and opportunity that we so desperately need in this country on behalf of myself and my liberal democrat colleague express our sympathy to the king and his family and our hope that his treatment will prove to be successful will speak to amendment and in addition to new clause to reiterate the liberal democrats be not supportive of the bill which be deception from the government after year of cruel tax hike on hard work family the legislation maintain the government unfair tax rise on work family through the freezing of income tax threshold fail to invest properly in our public service such as the nhs and take none of the vital step need to grow the uk economy some of the measure in the bill have worthy aim but the context be important from the outset amendment and make further change to the new regime define in the bill while the change may be necessary and sensible clarification just last week colleague in the other place sit on the economic affairs committee report their concern that the number of significant change make in the last year have lead to perception of instability in the uk tax relief regime and undermine the intend incentive effect of the relief what business need more than anything be certainty and stability the government chop and change on be indicative of wide failure to create stable and settle environment in which business can flourish perhaps the clear example of that have be the scrapping of the uk industrial strategy and the disbanding of the independent body oversee it this short sight step have rob business of the stability they need to grow the constant change to the relief regime be clear example of how that lack of foresight and stability can undermine the aim of economic growth once again urge the government even at this late stage to relaunch an industrial strategy proper industrial strategy can create the condition for sustainable growth include through effective and clear incentive for investment especially among sme and ensure that the uk regulatory and tax framework be gear towards foster innovation new clause introduce an exemption to the energy generator levy for new plant investment the liberal democrats believe that although this may help to strengthen investment in renewable energy and contribute towards our net zero target the government own assessment of the measure note that it be unlikely to affect the retail price of electricity for household as energy price remain tie to gas price the bill and the autumn statement from which it arise do nothing to help family with soar energy price or to put proper windfall tax on the oil and gas giant the government continue to sit on their hand as business and family struggle with energy price inflation windfall tax on the super profit of oil and gas producer could raise significant revenue which could have pay for target package of support for those worst affect by the energy crisis by double the warm home discount and invest in an emergency home insulation scheme it remain clear that november autumn statement and the finance bill both represent miss opportunity to address the crisis in energy price to conclude while the liberal democrats be supportive of certain measure within the bill such as the extension of full expensing we can not support any legislation that arise from such deceptive and unjust autumn statement ultimately british household be see the big fall in living standard since the and household across the country be cry out for real support from the government for action on the cost of live crisis and investment in our nhs but all we have hear be more stale announcement from conservative government who be completely out of touch concur with the comment make by other about king charles on my behalf and that of the democratic unionist party and his loyal subject in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland especially northern ireland pray as know you do mr deputy speaker as well as other in the chamber for king charles and for the royal family pray for speedy recovery to his health pray as we all pray to the great healer omnipotent over all that his family will know the peace of the lord as they support he at this time thank all those who have contribute to this bill debate and thank you mr deputy speaker for give the chance to participate understandably much of the bill focus on the measure that be need to deliver the autumn statement the minister understand that would like to welcome he to his place as he know hold he in great respect and look forward to his response at the end of this debate for every public sector pay rise that be rightly award money must be raise and therefore we all support the principle of this bill in theory however in practice not many of we want to sign off on bill that raise taxis for those who be struggle at present obviously as price have rise obligation have go up correspondingly northern ireland have be seek complete removal of the air passenger duty as way of enhance our connectivity and our attractiveness to international business investment as result the rise in apd be disappointing know what the minister response will be we be all aware of what the renewal of stormont mean it mean that we can look at this matter ourselves none the less the renewal of the assembly have also highlight the issue of the allocation of finance it be clear that an overhaul of the funding formula for northern ireland be necessary to meet the need in the long term before leave the office this morning hear the secretary of state for northern ireland on the radio say that he hop that new funding formula would be find for northern ireland we on the northern ireland affairs committee have also put forward that view it be matter that involve all party the hon member for belfast south claire hanna and for north down stephen farry join we in want the same that be three of the political party in northern ireland that want that formula there be also labour member who support the view along with number of conservatives with some concern we be all push for formula similar to the welsh system if that come into place we in northern ireland would benefit and that be only fair and right be highlight this because if we as party wish to do something about air passenger duty in the northern ireland assembly or if cross party group be wish to do the same we would need to have that formula in place as say we be look for fair funding for the future the billion that have be make available now be money that many of my constituent believe have be withhold and that be welcome ever mindful of the positivity that come out of the debate last week say let we be positive in look forward order the hon gentleman understand that he have catch my eye and have catch his may gently remind he that we be talk about the government new clause and amendment at the moment there be third reading debate ahead in which more measure can be raise if necessary but at the moment will he please concentrate on the matter in hand know when see you look at mr deputy speaker that you be go to tell to get back on to the subject be about to do so thank you for that very kind reminder you speak to in very nice way which be much appreciated do refer to new clause and air passenger duty so will quickly return to that when look at number of these issue address in the bill could see very clear and obvious theme air passenger duty to rise in line with the retail price index plastic packaging to rise in line with the consumer price index aggregate levy in line with rpi tobacco levy in line with rpi plus and vehicle excise duty for car van and motor bike in line with rpi so it continue and to be honest that seem to be understandable however what be clear in the finance bill be that although these thing rise by rpi or cpi understand how the system work the government have again choose to ignore the need of the work middle class wish to make this point have do so in every finance debate mr deputy speaker have take every opportunity can to bring up this matter be seek the support of the minister on this indeed have ask the minister about this on number of occasion so he know about the issue it be about the middle class family who need that extra bit of help they be pay their tax but the and year threshold be not helpful if we wish to address the issue of new clause in relation to permanent full expensing and the issue of air passenger duty the thing that people want then we also have to address the issue of the threshold as well gently say to the minister that when it come to how we help our squeeze middle class be not talk about the very wealthy can he look at change the threshold ask the minister for direct response on that do not want he to talk about the high income benefit charge or any other mitigation just want he to help we understand why those who pay into the tax system do not get as much as they should when they be struggle in way that familie back in could not have imagine the government know that to be the case think the minister know it to be the case so when it come to legislation that help we to represent all of the people of this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland let this bill tonight be one that do just that call the minister thank you mr deputy speaker may join you mr speaker and the whole house in wish his majesty speedy recovery follow the announcement this evening wish to thank right hon and hon member for contribute to this debate shall respond to as many of the point as can and also talk to the amendment that have be move on new clause agree that we must prevent fraud and ensure that all taxpayer pay their fair share to help achieve that the new maximum sentence for the most egregious example of tax fraud the new criminal offence on the promoter of tax avoidance and enhance director disqualification power will come into force on royal assent of this bill that will all help at of total liability the uk tax gap be at the joint low rate ever record and have remain low and stable the uk tax gap compare favourably with that of our international partner hmrc have already publish performance update that provide information on its compliance performance every quarter so we believe that this new clause be not necessary new clause be pretty much the same as the new clause reject in committee of the whole house as have say previously we believe that the provision be unnecessary as the information have be publish in the tax information and impact note alongside each policy change that give clear explanation of the policy objective together with detail of the implementation cost for both hmrc and business new clause would require the government to publish detail of sentence give and stop notice issue to tackle evasion and avoidance in the past five year as well as revenue expect to be generate by measure in this bill to tackle evasion and avoidance in each of the next five year however hmrc publish information on the number of custodial sentence receive for tax compliance offence and the average sentence length in its annual report and account the annual report and account will be publish this summer provide full overview of hmrc performance the government also publish list of tax avoidance scheme subject to stop notice on with the most recent report publish on december hmrc have issue more than stop notice since issue the first one in the government also publish revenue estimate for the next five year of the clause in this bill in the tax information and impact note therefore as the information request by new clause be publicly available in routine hmrc publication the publication request by new clause be unnecessary new clause would require the government to report on the likely impact of the measure in the bill on public health inequality and poverty matter that concern we all and that we discuss in committee exist mechanism already effectively monitor and assess government policy in those area render the amendment redundant department such as the department of health and social care and its arm length body diligently evaluate policy to enhance health up and down the country through the office for health improvement and disparities and the national institute for health and care research they address health inequality and provide robust evidence for policy development various government unit such as the cabinet office equality hub contribute to levelling up opportunity and ensure fairness the government equalities office the race disparity unit the disability unit and the social mobility commission all focus on different equality dimension to guide and support inclusive policy development across the country we therefore do not believe that new clause be necessary on new clause agree that it be important to regularly review and evaluate policy and to be transparent which my right hon friend the member for wokingham john redwood also highlight his majesty revenue and customs have publish tax information and impact note set out the impact of the measure include the economic impact and the office for budget responsibility have already conduct and publish extensive analysis on the investment and growth impact of full expensing that be available in its economic and fiscal outlook november which therefore negate the need to publish separate assessment in six month time the impact of permanent full expensing will be monitor through information collect from tax return and through regular communication with business and representative body new clause would require the publication of review of the multiplier use to calculate the high rate of air passenger duty that apply to large private jet appreciate that there be some challenge in understand they but assure the hon member for ealing north james murray that there be no attempt to mislead or give inaccurate information to the house the table be available and will provide he with one the government review the rate of taxis and relief include apd annually to ensure that they be appropriate and reflect the current state of the economy as have be the usual practice since apd be introduce in rate be announce over month in advance to provide airline with sufficient notice some of the challenge with the calculation and the point about round to the pound have arise because in april we cut apd on domestic flight by but not the rate for private jet which therefore remain equal to that on short haul international flight the bill provide for the uprating of apd rate by forecast rpi in round to the near pound and then of course there be the multiplier some of this be the sheer mathematic of ensure that we do not have disparity current apd rate ensure that passenger in private jet pay significantly more tax than passenger on commercial flight for example in the high rate for domestic private jet passenger will be more than time the economy rate since the government keep all rate include all apd rate under regular review new clause be unnecessary note the appeal of the hon member for strangford jim shannon which have hear before the minister know that be particularly fond of he but if he have hear my request before let we now have action we always try to act can not do everything though note the hon gentleman comment in similar vein my hon friend the member for totnes anthony mangnall raise the importance more broadly of the tourism hospitality and leisure sector and of the creative sector he be absolutely right measure in the bill and elsewhere will support all those sector of course business rate relief be vital to the tourism retail hospitality and leisure sector my right hon friend the member for wokingham make range of comment some outside of my direct remit assure he that will raise his point which range from bond to public sector efficiency vital area with colleague in the department be somewhat entertain by the comment of the labour spokesman the hon member for ealing north who be effectively ask to commit to conservative party policy as enthusiastically as he do which be quite turn up for the book of course we welcome labour support for the policy that we have announce but there be clear blue water between the labour party and the conservative party in term of principle about the size and scale of government and the level of taxation we have see labour flip flop over the billion be not sure what the policy be today it be rather rich of he to ask for commitment from give the flip flopping that be so prevalent in every area of labour policy at one point the labour party be supportive of brexit now do not know be labour members against it be they supportive of the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn be prime minister or do they not want he in the party be they in favour of nationalisation or against it be they in favour of private sector involvement in the nhs or against it in whole host of policy area we have see persistent perennial flip flopping from the opposition literally have goldfish whose commitment would trust more than those from the labour front bench on those point we will have to respectfully agree to disagree as say new clause and the six amendment that the government have table will help to ensure that the change in the bill apply as intend and deliver vital policy to protect renewable investment they will make the tax environment more easily understand by business and protect vital tax revenue use to fund our public service therefore urge that they be add to the bill the six new clause table by the opposition seek to get the government to publish datum and information that be already be publish through other source as have outline therefore urge the house to reject they question put and agree to new clause accordingly read second time and add to the bill new clause assessment of the impact of permanent full expensing the chancellor of the exchequer must within six month of this act be pass publish an assessment of the impact of the measure in clause of this act on business investment and economic growth the review under subsection must assess the impact of full expensing be make permanent and consider what other policy would support the effectiveness of the measure in clause of this act james murray this new clause would require the chancellor to publish an assessment of the impact on investment and growth of the measure in this act to make full expensing permanent and to consider what other policy could support the effectiveness of permanent full expensing bring up and read the first time question put that the clause be read second time debbie abrahams tahir

economy permanent full expensing have be call the single most transformational thing we could do for investment and it be welcome by more than company and trade association the bill also merge two significant government scheme the sme scheme and the expenditure scheme in do that we be meet our aim of simplify the system while provide great support to british business so that they can spend less time on administration and more time on innovation the bill also introduce great support for loss make intensive sme and lower the intensity threshold require to access that support to help around extra sme to far support investment in renewable energy we have introduce new asset exemption for the electricity generator levy measure that will continue to drive growth in both our renewable sector and the wide economy we also continue to support our world lead creative industry with tax measure that reform the film tv and video game tax relief turn they into refundable expenditure credit that be easy for business our second aim be to support employment we must remove barrier to work and incentive to not work and most of all must ensure that hard work and expertise be reward that be why the bill make change to encourage people to stay in work and use their expertise for long the bill will complete the abolition of the lifetime allowance amend pension tax rule so that employee with valuable hard earn expertise be no long encourage to reduce their hour or retire early the office for budget responsibility estimate that this will retain worker annually keep many high skilled employee and experienced individual in our labour market while ensure that they receive their rightful benefit for work our third aim be to create simple fair and more modern tax system an aim that the bill also support make full expensing permanent be huge simplification for large firm but we be nation of million of small business in the bill we be expand the cash basis simplified way for over million small and grow trader to calculate their profit and pay their income tax while we remain focused on reduce the tax burden we can not overstate the role of tax in support public service so we must all do our part everyone must pay their fair share which be why the bill introduce new criminal offence for those who promote tax avoidance scheme and continue to promote they after receive stop notice alongside this his majesty revenue and customs will for the first time be able to bring disqualification action against the director of company involve in promote tax avoidance include those who control or exercise influence over company these be vital step in ensure that the system be fair for all and that those who try to undermine it face the consequence thank right hon and hon member from across the house for their helpful and insightful contribution to the debate on the bill also thank the many stakeholder who have provide their view on the issue raise the treasury hmrc official and house clerks who have help the bill to get to this point this bill back british business reward hard work nurture innovation and support our lead industry while solidify long term economic growth for those reason commend it to the house begin by wish his majesty the king the very good for speedy recovery my colleague and be think of he and the royal family at this time and we wish he swift return to full health throughout consideration of the bill the opposition have make it clear that it contain number of measure for which we have be call for some time for instance we welcome the government finally make full expensing permanent after so many year of chop and change capital allowance we have make it clear that we will maintain that policy if we win power this year we have also make it clear that we will maintain the system of tax credit introduce by the bill again after so many year of this government chop and change the design of the scheme in both case that be because we prize stability and predictability for business they have make it clear to we that they value that greatly we know that provide certainty be critical factor in boost business investment and economic growth if labour win the next general election we would put that certainty and stability at the heart of our approach in government by publish road map in the first six month set out our business tax plan for the whole parliament we have set out our approach to full expensing and to corporation tax so be disappointed that the minister be not able to give we clear guarantee that the conservatives will maintain full permanent expensing and cap corporation tax at for the whole of the next parliament business can have confidence however that both of those commitment be lock in with labour of course there be provision in the bill of which we have be critical not least the fact that it freeze tax for passenger fly around the uk on private jet while hike taxis for everyone else who be fly economy or business class also the government admit that some provision will need to be return to and correct that be far from ideal position to be in before bill have even become law we know this be the case because towards the end of last month hmrc admit that the way in which the government have legislate to remove the lifetime allowance have create unintended consequence for member with multiple pension scheme hmrc say that further legislation will be necessary to fix three area in schedule relate to the abolition of the lifetime allowance that clearly indicate rush legislation that run the risk of create problem for all involve the legal firm wedlake bell for instance have say the propose new tax regime replace the lta at breakneck speed from april be very risky for all party include trustee administrator member and indeed hmrc itself more widely our concern with this bill as with the autumn statement it follow be that the conservatives can not hide or move on from their year of economic failure those year of failure have leave economic growth languish and people across britain bad off last november autumn statement for growth be the attempt at an economic growth plan from the conservatives the truth be that the conservatives be incapable of get our country back on track we need general election so that labour can offer the change and the plan that family and business across britain need call the chair of the treasury committee will not detain the house for long because have the feeling that not all my colleague be here to listen to my remark however want to make couple of point first have hear the opposition complain about the measure in this finance bill one would think that they do not like they but they be not here this evening they be not vote against third reading and they have not table any solid proposal themselves the only economic policy anyone have hear from the opposition be the extra billion that they want to impose in taxis on our business and our family do my hon friend agree that it be almost as though the opposition do not have plan would agree with my hon friend point out that the pro growth pro supply side measure in this finance bill have not stoke inflation indeed inflation have fall from over down to and accord to the bank of england forecast it be on track to reach so one have to commend the measure take in this bill and look forward to vote for that progress shortly add my thank to the official from the treasury and hmrc who have work so hard on this legislation only to hear that in month time there will be another budget and another finance bill one have to recognise the hard work that have go into this bill but do worry that hmrc be be ask to do more and more worry about the fact that various threshold have be freeze and in particular as the minister know that the high income child benefit charge be affect more taxpayer up and down the land be worried about one of the measure one that be within hmrc bailiwick it be the measure allow people to put fractional share into their individual saving account that be very welcome announcement in last year autumn statement try to put down an amendment to the bill about it but it be find not to be orderly because that change have not be legislate for this time around in fact the word be that hmrc will not be able to put that in place until at least the next tax year can ask the financial secretary to convey the sense of urgency that think we all feel about make these pro growth pro investment change there be wide range of measure in this finance bill that welcome and look forward to the budget on march think we can pay tribute to all the hard work that the financial secretary his team and all the treasury and hmrc official have put into this excellent piece of legislation call the snp spokesperson in this third reading debate on the finance bill one thing have be conspicuously absent from both the tory and the labour front benchers speech the one thing affect people most just now their struggle with the cost of living crisis people be struggle to pay their bill they be struggle to pay their mortgage which have go up because of this government disastrous mini budget they be struggle to pay their rent they be struggle to pay their food bill because of these party disastrous brexit which be push food price inflation even higher they be struggle to pay their energy bill because this government have be asleep at the wheel while price have be rise and even allow the energy price cap to go up in january when bill have never be high this be travesty of finance bill it have do nothing to help the people of scotland with their finance it have do nothing to help people across the rest of the uk and will definitely vote against it tonight may ask colleague in all part of the house for some indulgence unfortunately be miss out on report but very much want to speak about new clause which table it be very close to my heart and it be the reason why become an mp specifically it be about ask the government to make an assessment of the public health effect of the bill particularly in term of regional inequality the impact on protect characteristic and the impact on the nhs would first like to associate myself with the comment of my hon friend the member for ealing north james murray about his majesty king charles wish he very speedy recovery and send good wish to his family have hop that might convince the minister just little more than do in committee about what difference the assessment in my new clause would make be go to extend the argument just little more if he will bear with appreciate that can not do anything about the issue in this bill but perhaps he could think about it for the one we will have after the budget because will be return to this issue again the proposal be not about change anything in the finance bill it be about publish the government evaluation of the impact of their policy as announce in the autumn statement on the health of our constituent as mediate through for example change in poverty and socioeconomic inequality ideally that would have be do during the planning of the autumn statement but give that that do not happen my new clause would have provide the opportunity to make decision base on an evaluation of the impact on our health include our child health many member will have hear about and read the report of the academy of medical sciences on child health which come out early today in it the uk have be reveal to have stall infant mortality rate which be bad than of that in similar country this be after century during which infant mortality have be decrease the academy have put to we as decision maker that we need to be do lot well my new clause would have help the government in their quest for transparency fulfil the prime minister promise on that and restore confidence in the government and in politic more widely it would also have allow the government to monitor their commitment to level up our health across the country and to tackle the appalling north south divide be director of public health research at the university of liverpool along with professor dame margaret whitehead who in publish her report reveal for the first time the north south health divide it come out few year after the black report and it show the causal relationship between poverty and health margaret take it step far emphasise socioeconomic inequality not just poverty as the key driver of these health inequality we have be build on that evidence base for the past year or so many will have read the spirit level by professors richard wilkinson and kate pickett which show the universal relationship between socioeconomic inequality and educational attainment social mobility trust between community where have trust go within our crime and much more the narrow the gap in socioeconomic inequality the well almost all society across the world do on whole host of measure include health and wellbeing professor sir michael marmot totemic fair society healthy live report set out six objective across our life course of what we as country need to do to address these socioeconomic inequality and reduce health inequality he warn we in when we start to see life expectancy in england as whole flatlining which be accompany by decline healthy life expectancy we hear many question in today department for work and pensions oral about what we can do to get fit and healthy labour force and our inequality be partly why we be in our current position professor marmot also reveal that life expectancy for the poor woman and in the poor area be decline and that we be one of three advanced economy in the world where this have be happen along with the usa and iceland this be not question of our have reach peak life expectancy we be fall behind most of our competitor he also reveal that health inequality have increase and that there be an even starker north south health divide then covid hit the same pattern of infection ill health and death be see with covid as be see before the pandemic with other condition the same group of people and the same area be affect by covid as be affect by for example heart disease last month michael provide another update in his late report health inequalities live cut short he say in the bmj couple of week ago something that ask the prime minister about last week if everyone have the good health of the least deprive of the population there would have be million few death in england in the period to of these can be link to austerity in the first year of the covid pandemic there be further excess death today see no evidence that policymaker have learn from or even understand this injustice or its economic consequence urge they to watch short film the unequal pandemic which show the human cost of this inaction our experience of covid and these inequality be not inevitable today academy of medical sciences report estimate that cost of billion year could have be avoid by early childhood intervention the relationship between population health and productivity be also well establish in its health for wealth report the northern health science alliance argue that in order to improve our productivity and growth we must improve our health it calculate that improve the health of the north to the level of the rest of england would increase productivity by billion year it be in the economy and the chancellor interest to undertake this health assessment of his measure appreciate that that be not go to happen in this bill but would be grateful if the minister would consider it for the next one be grateful in the finance bill committee for the minister respond with long list of datum that the government already collect on poverty and so on unfortunately he do not explain how these datum be then analyse to assess the impact of his government measure on for instance strict social security sanction and how those would affect the current level of child live in poverty deep poverty and destitution as describe in the joseph rowntree foundation uk poverty report he do not explain if these datum have be disaggregate to examine the impact of these policy on different part of the country on disabled people or on people from ethnic minority community and he do not explain what scenario modelling on poverty deep poverty and destitution have be undertake to understand whether more child will die before their first birthday because they have be bear into poor or destitute family for each increase in child poverty an extra baby per livebirth will die before their first birthday professor sir michael marmot have ask we to provide hope hope that we as politician can recognise and understand that these inequality must be address and that they be not inevitable and agree urge the minister to really consider this if not now then in the next finance bill and to come back with set of proposal on how the government be go to do it question put that the bill be now read the third time bim afolami adam afriyie nickie aiken peter aldous lucy allan lee

the constituency of my right hon and learn friend the member for torridge and west devon sir geoffrey cox the value of tssos can not be overstate they be hugely welcome by the community they serve key theme from this extensive list of duty be the focus on prevention early intervention and reduce vulnerability emergency response work take up less than of their time their real value be in provide the three emergency service with presence in otherwise hard to reach community when task through any of the three service they look to problem solve from multi agency perspective that ability to deal with issue be far enhance by have access to datum across all service with information share agreement in place to give basic example of tsso holistic approach while attend police neighbourhood dispute they may fit smoke alarm make mental health referral signpost family to third sector organisation or explore suitable pathway to cornwall council service or other available support service all the while tri service officer ensure the high level of safeguarding be in place for the vulnerable member of our community they lead on all tssos be highly skilled motivated professional bespoke training package have be develop for they in cornwall the outcome be clear and very positive indeed first have tsso reduce the demand and impact on the three emergency service in part of the world where as result of our geography and ever grow demand our emergency service be spread out thinly tri service officer have be widely praise for their proactive approach as well as their level of dedication show to the task at hand while maintain people focus approach they also reduce the demand on key partner within the public private and voluntary sector in their local community where tsso help with emergency response work they do so with excellence figure from show that tssos in cornwall respond to incident in close to incident they administer urgent first aid include through the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation or defibrillator put simply they save life that year one officer tsso hart receive chief superintendent commendation for outstanding work deal with collapse male who be have heart attack tsso performance figure from the past year speak for themselves there be over police log attend nearly ambulance call attend nearly domestic premise risk reduction visit conduct nearly antisocial behaviour incident address more than hour spend provide fire cover and more than hour log provide safeguarding community engagement and training for other officer as well as much else on top of that they have be credit with build strong link between the three service and local community in cornwall in recent year tssos have link up with the cornwall base charity fleet the front line emergency equipment trust to deliver raizer mobile lift chair to people who have have fall so that those people can be safe at home all tssos now carry raizer chair in their vehicle because of the funding gain in support of the project tsso have also partner with school on junior life skill across cornwall more than child have have the chance to engage directly with officer at police and fire station and learn about their work in the long term that emphasis on prevention of vulnerability and early intervention aim to reduce call to our service the community serve by tsso have broad overlap with area of deprivation as five tri service officer be base in the community network area of the most deprive area in cornwall those area have high health inequality high crime rate and high vulnerability risk factor whole system multi agency approach be key to address the challenge that area of high deprivation face build safe community and reduce frontline demand the tsso be uniquely place not just to bridge the three pronged gap but to do so in cost effective way deliver excellent value for the taxpayer as tsso expand into devon will the minister look at the success we have have and how the model might benefit other part of the country and other rural and coastal area in particular understand that devon and cornwall police have begin discussion with the home office on that it lead to an opportunity to present the tsso model to official at recent event the response be apparently warm and delegation have arrange to visit later this month ask the minister to take an interest in that visit invite he to cornwall to see for himself the invaluable work of our tri service officer in our community we also plan to hold an event in parliament in the come month to give colleague an opportunity to meet those involve in the scheme and to discuss how it could benefit their area will extend an invitation to the event to the minister this role which cross over the three emergency service have become more understand and use over the last month that be largely down to the proactive work of tssos in make sure that their role and duty be well understand there be now great understanding across all the local partner which have lead to tssos be well use to support and complement service recently have the pleasure of go on patrol with one of our excellent tssos lewis rosewell who be base in the village of st dennis and serve many of the clay mining village in the middle of my constituency spend time with lewis be both informative and inspiring and give real insight into the valuable work and service provide by tssos we do fire safety visit visit vulnerable resident do welfare check and follow up on recent antisocial behaviour incident it be the near thing that have see to the old school bobby on the beat style of policing but there be the additional benefit of tssos work closely with whole range of service want to bring funding concern to the minister attention they represent the big challenge to our fantastic tsso programme the tsso model be base on each of the three service contribute third tri service officer cost around each year and each of the three service contribute which represent excellent value for money give the positive feedback and outcome in reduce demand and response time there be real desire to expand the service across cornwall include to some town rather than just village there be commitment from the police and the fire service to make this contribution but the nhs integrate care board have not yet confirm that it will match the funding for the come year it would be disappointing if the nhs the highest fund service in cornwall be not able to fund its share of the cost of expand the service would not be do my job represent my constituent if do not urge the integrate care system to make the funding commitment will the minister use his office to promote the scheme to the nhs and encourage it to confirm the funding as soon as possible so that our tssos can work alongside our gp surgery and community health hub in provide support believe that the scheme will become key part of the prevention agenda in the come year it would be frustrating if it be hold back by the nhs lack of willingness to play its part this project should be encourage especially in rural area of the country what plan do the minister have to make sure that other part of the country be aware of its success in cornwall and to assist they in develop similar project finally let place on record my great thank to inspector miles topham and all those who have enable this project to happen and our excellent tssos wish they every success for the year ahead and in future let start by congratulate my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay steve double on secure this evening adjournment debate which have come slightly early than we would normally expect he have do very good job of explain the benefit of tri service safety officer in devon and cornwall who set an example that as he say the rest of the country can follow we in the home office be keen to see lot more co operation between blue light service that be happen in some other part of the country as well but not in such an integrated way in humberside bedfordshire and the wide eastern region fire and rescue service already work with the health service on dedicated fall and bariatric team help the ambulance service to deal with incident in fact in the year to september fire and rescue service in england attend medical incident in addition to incident affect entry or exit to premise so there be some co operation around the country already in our white paper we strongly encourage further co operation between blue light service as my hon friend say in rural area where there be not such density of coverage it make great deal of sense for police ambulance and fire service to work together to provide response the tri service safety officer in devon and cornwall whom he describe be shin example of how that can work in practice benefit resident the length and breadth of both county pay tribute to my hon friend for his work in encourage and support those tri service safety officer pay tribute to the fantastic police and crime commissioner for devon and cornwall alison hernandez who have work very hard to make this happen the work of police and crime commissioner can really make difference as hers have in part of the country such as essex and staffordshire where we have police fire and crime commissioner this kind of co operation between police and fire become quite lot easy also pay tribute to the work of my hon friend the member for north cornwall scott mann who be sit next to he have campaign successfully to reopen bude community police station it recently reopen and have tri service safety officer base in it for the benefit of all resident of bude and the surround neighbourhood agree with what my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay say about value for money each of the three service have to contribute only about per tsso which be great deal cheap than fund position each very much hope that the police and fire service in devon and cornwall will continue to fund that be sure that he be make the case both to health ministers and to the local integrate care board for that funding to continue if he want any assistance from in lobby my ministerial colleague he have only to ask and will be happy to do that but be sure that he and his colleague in devon and cornwall be do that agree with my hon friend point that other rural force in england and wales could learn from what have be happen in devon and cornwall that apply less to large urban area where police force and ambulance service be already very densely concentrated however even in urban area the fire service tend to be under use so there be an opportunity to get the fire service to do more to assist the ambulance service in provide response have be discuss that with my colleague at the department of health and social care however as he eloquently describe and explain tri service safety officer could work well in other rural or sparsely populated area cumbria which now have police fire and crime commissioner spring to mind interruption hear support for cumbria from my hon friend the member for workington mark jenkinson will happily raise that point with the national police chiefs council and the national fire chiefs council and will commend the model for consideration by rural force and fire service around the country my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay have set out the good work go on in devon and cornwall and the positive impact of tri service safety officer again commend police and crime commissioner alison hernandez for make this happen will do everything can to assist colleague in devon and cornwall and rural force around the country in make sure that as many place as possible can benefit from this excellent initiative question put and agree to house adjourn
