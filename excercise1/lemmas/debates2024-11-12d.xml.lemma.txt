oral answers to questions energy security and net zero the secretary of state be ask climate change international leadership what step he be take to establish international leadership on climate change today the secretary of state for energy security and net zero my right hon friend the member for doncaster north ed miliband be already at in baku where he will be lead climate negotiation he send his apology the prime minister be also at and will be speak at the global leader summit announce our ambitious align nationally determine contribution and show that the uk be truly back on the international stage write statement will also be make later today welcome the leadership the government be show in particular on ndcs as my hon friend mention the news that this year be likely to be the hot on record across the world be deeply concern and remind we that climate breakdown be global challenge that we must all face do the minister agree that we must have ambitious plan at home so that we can go to cop and challenge other world leader to do more to tackle climate change completely agree with my hon friend there be direct link between take action to protect the british people at home and lead on climate action abroad if we want to protect our country from future energy shock and the runaway cost of climate chaos we must work with other country to protect our planet we now have the credibility to do that because of the action we have take since enter government as be apparent when attend pre cop meeting in baku last month and as the prime minister will demonstrate in baku today warmly welcome the new government target to cut carbon emission and know the secretary of state and the minister thoroughly understand the importance of join up action on climate justice can she tell we whether every single government policy across every government department will now be assess to check whether it be compatible with what step be the government take to ensure the global south be properly compensate for climate loss and damage on the second point first at this cop we want to ensure that we fully operationalise the loss and damage fund so we then start get money into it and channel money to develop country we also want to do that through the new collective quantified goal which we hope will be ambitious and multi layered on the question of look at our policy across the piece that be very much my job we will be respond soon to the committee on climate change report which the hon lady will know be quite critical of the previous government action we will be set out our plan to implement the ndc and look at the next carbon budget all those thing require effort share across department to ensure we actually meet they it be about not just set ambitious target but make sure that unlike the previous government we have strategy to get we there rise call noah law be you stand indicate dissent okay call toby perkins here man who be ready to go be ready to go and so be the prime minister it be great to see he in baku show leadership the recent cali conference be disappointment ultimately nation be not able to reach agreement alongside the positive step the uk government be take what conversation be we have with international partner to recognise the necessity of an agreement that bring all western nation together in show equal ambition thank my hon friend for that question know he be at cali there be some progress on such issue as digital sequence information but more need to be do we be very seized of the need to join up action on the nature and climate crisis when head out to tomorrow members will hopefully hear more from we on our effort to protect forest and on the support we be give to country at risk of deforestation we be also look at nature base solution to climate change the nature minister the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend the member for coventry east mary creagh will be out there as well and we will have more to say but entirely agree with my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins that we can not deal with one crisis in isolation from the other for the uk to be an international leader on climate change we need to bring the business community with we the summer berry company in my constituency recently invest million in ensure it be carbon neutral but it be then quote furth million to be able to feed its excess energy into the grid what be the minister do to make additional grid connection affordable and accessible for green business the energy minister the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for rutherglen michael shanks be very much involve with that issue we have also set up the energy superpower mission board head by chris stark have conversation with he yesterday about what we can do to ensure grid capacity and grid connection in the right place if the hon lady have specific issue to raise and would like to write to will make sure it be pass on to he call the shadow minister whom welcome to the front bench when ask the secretary of state about the appointment of rachel kyte as his international climate envoy during our last question session he fail to say whether quadrature capital million donation to the labour party have be declare to the department before her appointment and have still not receive reply to my letter of october will the minister tell whether the secretary of state declare those interest to the department before rachel kyte appointment and whether ministers have ever meet director of quadrature capital or quadrature climate foundation be sure that the shadow minister will receive reply to her letter in due course but can tell she that rachel kyte be extremely well respected and that her appointment as our special representative have be welcome across the board clean energy by what progress he have make on achieve clean energy by what progress he have make on achieve clean energy by what progress he have make on achieve clean power by what progress he have make on achieve clean power by in just four short month we have make rapid progress on achieve our mission for clean power by we have set up great british energy and announce its headquarters in aberdeen secure record break renewable project and consent to record amount of solar we be get on with deliver low bill energy security good job and climate action rolls royce in derby be an international leader in research on and the development of small modular reactor and it be fantastic that the government have acknowledge the role that smr will play in clean power generation energy security and green job in the budget we hear that the final decision on great british nuclear smr competition will conclude next spring do the minister agree that it be important for this opportunity to be seize as soon as possible agree with my hon friend that nuclear will play central role in our clean power mission and will continue to be critical part of our energy mix as we progress towards and far beyond great british nuclear be continue to drive forward the competition on small modular reactor with bid currently be evaluate by the department and look forward to have more to say about this in due course call the chair of the energy security and net zero committee the last government hold consultation on electricity market arrangement but despite have say that that be their flagship policy in this area they do not publish the result of that consultation do my hon friend agree that electricity and indeed energy market reform be crucial to achieve the government state clean energy target and to reduce bill and can he say whether this government will publish the result of the last government consultation and if so when congratulate my hon friend again on his appointment as chair of the select committee he bring huge amount of knowledge and experience to the role and agree with he about the importance of review electricity market arrangement we be build on the last government consultation and we will have more to say in the month ahead this be crucial element of how we achieve clean power by and ensure that our energy system of the future be fit for what will be different way of manage energy throughout the country we will have more to say about that in the month ahead last week report publish by the national energy system operator note that although the programme to roll out new small modular reactor be be develop for the roll out date would in fact be possible give that smr technology hold exciting and significant potential for investment in job and infrastructure in constituency such as mine have the minister consider the value of bring the roll out forward to my hon friend be right to say that nuclear will play vital role and that it not only deliver on our energy security but create good well pay job unlike the last government who in year do not deliver single nuclear project there be many consultation and process but not single nuclear power station be build this government be get on with deliver nuclear future last week report from the national energy system operator show that not only be clean power by achievable but it can lead to low bill and more secure system do the minister agree that the only way to protect bill payer permanently be to go as far and as fast as possible towards our clean power mission by my hon friend be absolutely right the report publish by the independent national energy system operator lay out not only that reach our clean power mission be entirely achievable but that it will bring down bill the importance of the report be that it set the course for how that be possible the reality which the conservative party refuse to accept be that the only way to get we off the rollercoaster of high bill be to deliver at pace the clean energy that we know will deliver energy security and climate leadership and bring down bill for people right across the country be delighted that the minister be set out that the report promise an extra billion of investment year in the energy sector and presumably the taxis to go with it which will of course come from the business that be pay for everything else in the budget that have just go by be there anything at all in his proposal that will actually bring down the cost of energy and not be replace by taxpayer funding it appear at the moment that there be nothing and energy price be already go up would encourage the right hon gentleman to read the neso report because it set out in great detail not only that clean power be achievable by but that it will lead to low bill what he say about investment miss the point in the last few week we have announce billion of pound of private sector investment in these project indeed scottish power have announce today that it will provide billion company be choose to invest in this country whereas they do not under the conservative party the reality be that once upon time the conservatives recognise that the drive to net zero be important they have abandon that commitment now thank the minister for agree to meet the offset offshore electricity grid taskforce group of mps later today we be very much look forward to the meeting do he recognise that achieve the deadline set out in the neso report require an acceleration of the process which in turn be dependent on much high level of public consent recognise the hon gentleman point and be look forward to meet he and his colleague this afternoon to discuss the particular issue in his area we need to build more network infrastructure across the uk to make this endeavour reality but he be right we want to bring community with we on this journey that be why we have say that we be look again at what community benefit will look like build on some of the work that the previous government do in consult on this issue crucially however if want to bring down bill and deliver energy security we will have to build the infrastructure and that be what this government be commit to do the minister know well the liberal democrats commitment to community energy will the government establish clean community energy scheme look at the barrier that currently face community energy project and look at support the national grid to deliver community energy the hon lady and have have number of conversation and recognise her commitment on this issue we have commit in the local power plan to deliver investment in community energy across the country importantly we want not only to invest in scheme but to deliver across government the mechanism need to make it more possible for community to deliver such scheme that will build capacity in community so that we can see more community energy what be the beef behind the government reluctance to embrace with enthusiasm locally generate community energy why do they vote against the amendment table to the great british energy bill by the hon member for bath wera hobhouse think the right hon gentleman think that be gotcha question but of course the conservative party do not vote for the bill at all amendment or not do not think he can really speak about what great british energy might deliver because despite it be one of the most popular policy at the last election the conservatives fail to bother to vote for it call the shadow secretary of state last week the national energy system operator publish full system cost analysis of the secretary of state flagship project to carbonise the grid by this morning the secretary of state say on several medium outlet that the report show that his plan will lower bill remind the house that the report assume that gas price be high than the department own estimate that the price of carbon price be at least double what it be now that the government can commission more offshore wind in the next two year than in the last six combine without move price and that they can build the grid at pace we have never see before in this country without any delay even if all that be achieve page of the report show that the cost of the system will be high for clarity would the minister like to repeat at the dispatch box the secretary of state claim that the neso report show that labour system will lead to low cost of electricity what the shadow secretary of state have just outline quite coherently be that the conservatives have no ambition in this space whatsoever but we do be very happy for the right hon lady to outline where our ambition be we will build fast than the previous government although have to say that that would not be difficult the shadow minister sit next to she the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie say quite clearly at their conference that the previous government have build infrastructure far too slowly and their former energy minister the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart say that their onshore wind ban be always mad we be quite happy to pick up where they leave off and deliver the clean power that this country need this be the ministerial team who tell the electorate they be go to cut their bill by without do any homework to find out how those plan would work they vote against our amendment to hold they to account on their own pledge just two week ago and now they be try to claim that the neso report show that their approach will lower bill when in fact it show in black and white that the system will be much more expensive do the minister not see that if they follow this plan we will be warning not an example to the rest of the world and that the british people will be cold and poor as result time and again the conservatives run away from their record on this in office the reason why people right across this country be pay more on their energy bill be that the conservatives do not get we off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel market but we be now move at pace the right hon lady may want to keep we in the vulnerable state where we be reliant on international gas market but we be determined that we will not do that we will bring down bill and deliver energy security be not ashamed to say that we will move with great ambition to deliver what this country need and to deliver the good job that go with it great british energy what step he be take to establish great british energy we be move at pace to set up great british energy so far we have appoint the start up chair jürgen maier we have announce that the headquarters will be in aberdeen and we have progress the bill through the house of commons this build on the first partnership announce for great british energy with the crown estate and on recent new deal to collaborate with scottish public body we be get on with the job of deliver century public ownership for the british people every family and every business in my constituency pay the price of year of conservative failure with rocket energy bill because the last government fail to invest in clean energy the opposition continue to oppose great british energy do the minister recognise the absurdity of their argument that they be quite happy with foreign public ownership as long as it be not uk citizen who own our energy my hon friend make good point it be important to remember that despite what the conservatives might have we believe great british energy be overwhelmingly popular with the british people that include the people in scotland because of course it be not just the conservative party who do not vote for great british energy surprisingly the scottish national party also fail to vote for publicly own champion in our energy space we be get on with deliver job and growth deliver with public ownership through great british energy before the election labour say that great british energy would cut electricity bill by after the election the labour government vote against write that into law and instead take away people winter fuel payment and make their bill more expensive the institute for fiscal studies have now say that their policy be fundamentally raise price for consumer to the tune of per household and we know from the neso report that this will get bad even if they triple the pace of wind roll out double the pace of grid connection and make other heroic assumption all of this be go to bump up cost far be it not we be do this from the basis of have the high electricity price in europe what assessment have the minister make of the impact on british industry question after question from the conservatives show that they do not recognise the part they play for year in why we be pay high bill than ever before we be the only party with an ambitious plan to get we off the volatile fossil fuel market the conservatives use to believe that in our drive to net zero we should build this infrastructure for the long term they be now oppose it but they will have to tell their constituent why they want to leave they expose to rise bill fusion power plant whether he plan to support the development of fusion power plant connect to the grid we agree that fusion could be globally transformative green energy solution the uk government fusion programme continue to lead the world in the development of fusion energy and our ambition be to continue to do so two week ago the budget announcement that the first fusion power plant will be build in bassetlaw be welcome news can the minister provide great detail on this commitment alongside the funding support be make available for the next financial year my hon friend be great champion for her constituency and be pleased to meet she to talk about this issue and to hear her westminster hall debate look forward to visit her constituency later this month to see the fusion café and to visit west burton the site of the step project after which hope to be able to share more detail on how we will support fusion dounreay in my constituency be the site of the uk first fission reactor today we have highly skilled workforce licensed site and local population that warmly support the industry will the government seriously consider involve dounreay as we bring fusion to its wonderful fruition think fusion have huge potential and so many company stand to benefit it be not just about the ultimate goal of fusion energy it be also about all the technological advance we will discover have speak to fusion company which be for example find use for cancer treatment be very interested to hear what the hon gentleman have to say about the possibility of fusion in his constituency we want to see this proceed if he drop line will be happy to explore the opportunity in his patch call the shadow minister we have speak lot about the conservative party record in government and be very proud of our record on fusion we launch the fusion futures programme to provide up to million of funding to train more than people we become the first country in the world to regulate fusion as distinct energy technology and we launch the process to build the spherical tokamak for energy production can not say that as quickly at what will be the first fusion power plant at west burton in nottinghamshire hon member hear hear member be very welcome will the minister confirm that it be still the government intention as it be ours to have fusion power on the grid by as mention be very much look forward to visit west burton soon the budget announce significant support for fusion energy in and yes we remain as ambitious as the previous government for the potential of fusion energy have confirm that be still the ambition which do the minister think will come first fusion on the grid or the final investment decision on sizewell the final investment decision on sizewell as understand it be expect soon we will hear more about support for that in the next spending review fusion energy have huge potential not just in the long term but from the innovation we be already see in that sphere which very much welcome carbon capture and storage what plan he have to support the development of carbon capture utilisation and storage project at acorn what recent step his department have take to support carbon capture and storage on october the government announce billion over the next year to launch the uk carbon capture utilisation and storage industry we will provide further detail on the next step for ccus include track project such as acorn in the come month thank the minister for her encouraging answer acorn include the st fergus site in aberdeenshire not only have significant role to play in achieve net zero in scotland but have the capacity to accept carbon from mainland europe this project could help the uk and europe to achieve their net zero goal and be significant not only for the port of peterhead in my constituency as the minister know but for the local power station which share the same integrated ambition acorn present very significant opportunity represent hundred of million of pound in new investment new job and economic growth for the north east for scotland and for the uk can the minister accelerate the decision making on the acorn project and will she commit to funding in we be commit to track and recognise the huge advantage of acorn that the hon gentleman have highlight our record billion investment demonstrate our long term commitment and give industry the certainty it need the up and down of ccus under the previous government do not provide the certainty that people require and certainty be what we be look to deliver we understand that people want clarity and we will be make further announcement in the come month the path to carbon capture and storage be litter with failure three previous project never get off the ground despite lot of taxpayer money go into they what precisely be the government go to do to ensure that this project deliver if the hon lady would look towards little bit will be able to hear the question we realise that ccus be an emerge industry but it be also one that we can lead on internationally thank to the unique geography of the north sea we will do all we can to help industry scale up in this technology which we believe will play crucial role in our mission towards clean power national grid energy mix whether he have have recent discussion with national grid on diversify the energy mix of its network the government regularly meet stakeholder to discuss the development of our energy infrastructure last week the government receive advice from the national energy system operator outline its advice on the pathway towards clean power by later this year we will publish our action plan which will set out detail on the future of our energy mix offshore wind have be real positive for our energy security and grid independence but unfortunately not when the wind do not blow give the election of president who tell we he be go to drill baby drill what revision do the minister anticipate to his timetable towards net zero as say in my previous answer later this year we will outline our action plan on how we will deliver on the target there be no change to our timetable in that regard the right hon gentleman raise good point about what happen when the wind do not blow and the sun do not shine and about ensure we have mix in our energy system that be why we remain supportive of nuclear and why we have recently announce investment in long duration energy storage to ensure we can capture energy and use it when we need it be delight by ofgem announcement this morning that it now recommend that the propose nautilus interconnector should be locate at the isle of grain not on the suffolk coast since have be elect have make firm representation to the minister and ofgem include via its consultation that the suffolk coast should not have be consider and brownfield site should have be consider first will the minister meet to discuss other national grid project in my constituency ofgem have announce today decision on number of interconnector those be decision for ofgem and not for the government we have recently announce the launch of strategic spatial energy plan to ensure that we plan such project holistically across the whole of the united kingdom and take into account number of scheme when plan future energy such as those my hon friend mention in her constituency will continue to have discussion about that with member from across the country china large offshore float wind turbine company ming yang smart energy plan to build its first manufacture plant outside china in scotland ming yang benefit from huge subsidy in china but there be serious question about energy security and national security the secretary of state say he want to end reliance on foreign autocrat but when he be ask about this on the radio this morning he have no answer will the minister rule out allow any turbine that might be control by hostile state we be encourage investment in the uk to build the infrastructure that we need in the future just today we have announce the clean industry bonus that will give as much support as possible to company to build their supply chain here in this country we will continue to look at supply chain and of course we take seriously the company across the range of business project that be invest in this country there be series of process already under way across government whenever anybody want to invest in this country those process will be follow in the usual manner mr speaker will you and the minister give the house an opportunity to celebrate the billion of investment announce today in offshore wind in this country it will provide job across the country as promise by this government which the british people be not use to after the past year will the minister meet to discuss the infrastructure require to connect that clean secure energy to our home in particular the sea link project that could have an impact in my constituency my hon friend be right to highlight the fantastic announcement today by scottishpower of billion of investment here in the uk build the infrastructure that we need and deliver job and skill in this country as well it be one of number of announcement that we expect because we be not agnostic in this government on deliver the industrial strategy that we need my hon friend the minister for industry be work on that at the moment we will deliver the job in this country to build the clean power of the future we will deliver good well pay job and the energy security we need renewable energy job creation what step she be take to support job creation in the renewable energy sector deliver good job be the drive force behind our growth and clean energy mission great british energy and the national wealth fund will crowd in private sector investment to spread job across the country through investment in clean energy be delighted that the prime minister have today launch the clean industry bonus which will incentivise developer to invest in the uk industrial heartland coastal area and oil and gas community boost job and deliver on another of our manifesto promise be also delighted with my hon friend commitment to deliver clean energy job it be important to constituency such as mine in peterborough which could be the king cross for new core hydrogen network as recommend by the national infrastructure commission thank to national gas project union national gas have its hydrogen ready gas compression site in our city and we be about to open new green technology centre to develop new green job and apprenticeship will the minister commit to work with local authority such as mine college and business such as national gas to deliver new job across the supply chain and in all part of the country completely agree with my hon friend sentiment and commend the work that he be do in his constituency low carbon technology will of course play critical role in our future from hydrogen to carbon capture and to renewable energy be pleased that in the budget we see the funding of hydrogen project which will drive job and growth be really keen to talk to he about his plan for peterborough become the king cross for hydrogen network and applaud the work that be go on in his constituency around green job rise rise call jim farron or he mr speaker laughter mr speaker perhaps if start the hon member for strangford jim shannon could finish in order to safeguard renewable job and to create new one will the minister consider specific project that have hydro turbine manufacturer such as gilkes in kendal and many other around the country work alongside our farmer to make use of stream beck and river that go through farmland to create renewable industry and indeed new job we be ambitious to create all the job that we want to see in the green technology of the future would be very interested to hear more about what the hon gentleman have to say the climate change committee estimate that up to net job could be create by opposition members have decide that they do not support that path the question be why be they object to all these new job that we will be create across our country warm homes plan what step he be take to introduce warm home plan what step he be take to introduce warm home plan what step he be take to introduce warm home plan we be commit to an ambitious warm home plan which will upgrade home across the country make they warm and cheap to run by instal new insulation and roll out low carbon heating such as solar and heat pump as first step the government have commit an initial billion over the next three year towards upgrade home we have already hit the ground run with the roll out of our warm home local grant and our warm home social housing fund we will set out more detail in due course too many of my constituent be live in poorly insulate social housing new mother dionne for instance have the insulation from her flat removed last year by her social landlord because it be full of mould and mildew she be now face her second winter without insulation will the minister confirm that the warm home plan will introduce tough new standard to ensure that social housing provider get on and insulate their housing stock yes absolutely raise standard in the social housing sector will be critical part of our warm home plan we have already announce plan to lift million renter out of fuel poverty by raise the minimum energy efficiency standard in both the private and the social rent sector which will ensure that renter no long have to live in cold drafty home we will also unlock billion worth of investment to the national wealth fund in partnership with lead bank to upgrade more social home and we will set out more detail to build on that in due course thank the minister for her commitment to the warm home plan many of my constituent in north somerset have write to in recent week detail their concern that the scheme do not take sufficient account of high energy usage due to long term illness will the minister share whether the department have any plan to look into uplift the warm home discount for participant with relevant long term illness we recognise that many vulnerable people include those with high energy usage often bear the great burden when energy price increase that be why we be do all we can include by work with energy company to make sure that we be provide additional support this winter and beyond will take my hon friend point away and follow up with he in due course give that of home in shipley have an energy performance certificate rating of or below very much welcome the government commitment to the warm home plan the charity groundwork provide warm home healthy people scheme across bradford district instal energy efficiency measure and offer advice and support on energy bill do the minister agree that local charity need support to continue to help those who be most in need this winter it be national scandal that so many home across the country have an epc rating that be below failure of the last government to deliver the scale of home upgrade that we need we be determined to end the injustice of people live in cold and draughty home completely agree that we must do everything we can to support vulnerable household with their energy bill this winter that be why we be provide million household with the warm home discount why we be work with energy supplier to provide additional support include through charity and why we have extend the household support fund do the minister agree that we particularly need comprehensive warm home plan in rural area in order to identify very old home and ensure that insulation be target to maximise reduction in their energy usage we will ensure that we see upgrade in every part of the country we will be work with combined authority local government and the devolved administration to make sure that we be deliver the scale of upgrade need across the country in the light of the warm home plan be the minister aware of challenge face by homeowner who use the green home grant for spray foam insulation many now find their home unmortgageable and face significant cost for removal and repair will the minister consider measure to support such homeowner as part of the warm home plan be aware that many household have have upgrade that have not go to plan it be critical that we build confidence because in the end we need to persuade consumer up and down the country to have these upgrade there be scheme under the last administration that be not regulate and do not have the correct standard and we be work hard to make sure that we raise standard across the piece we be go to need warm home plan because with the snow and ice come in on cold front scotland be see sum front head north from this labour government cut to the winter fuel payment and the pensioner cost of live payment for winter weather that be here now that be not in the manifesto what be in the manifesto be cut to fuel bill but those cost be now up by when will this government do single thing for people face fuel poverty we will work across the country to tackle fuel poverty but remind the hon member that fuel payment be devolve the scottish government have be give the big budget and it be time to get on with the job and fix the situation call the liberal democrat spokesperson home in the uk be among the least energy efficient in europe with unparalleled health productivity and carbon emission cost to society as result of the last government failure to act agree with the minister it be disgrace that this be happen in one of the large economy in the we welcome the news of the warm home plan come next year but do the minister agree that an emergency home insulation programme this winter with free insulation for people on low income be necessary so that people in south cambridgeshire do not have to face the choice between heating and eat let assure the hon member that we be hit the ground run with home insulation we be roll out our warm home local grant and our warm home social housing fund to target people this winter this year because we need to deliver the big ever upgrade decarbonisation public sector bodies what step he be take to support public sector body to decarbonise as the first step towards the warm home plan we have commit an initial billion that include billion towards public sector decarbonisation because we know that we have to ensure that our school and hospital reduce their energy bill decarbonise the public sector be good for our net zero target but it also release money for more teacher nurse and street cleaner so that saving benefit our community rather than energy giant school across telford be cry out for that investment will the minister do all she can to decarbonise the public sector in the year to come completely agree decarbonise our public sector will not only reduce emission but low bill we estimate that the billion that we have allocate to public sector decarbonisation will reduce bill by about million per year that be big step forward but there be more work to do it be clear that there be role for all school across this great united kingdom to play in public sector decarbonisation they also have role in educate the child in their classroom who we want to be the pioneer of tomorrow what have be do to ensure that the good thing that happen on the mainland of the united kingdom be share with regional administrations such as the northern ireland assembly we will work on that with the devolved administrations across the united kingdom good practice be happen across local government and regional government we will ensure that everyone can learn from it and we will deliver the big upgrade in generation great british energy job creation what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on job creation the energy transition present an incredible opportunity for job creation right across the uk particularly in our industrial and coastal community through great british energy we will build on scotland reputation as world leader in energy and secure long term well pay job in the industry of the future recently have the privilege of open an extension to the kype muir wind farm in my constituency the extension alone will generate enough power for home for year my constituency be also home to part of whitelee the large onshore wind farm in europe however not one of those turbine be manufacture in the uk let alone locally what step be the minister take to develop uk manufacturing capacity in that area know well my hon friend constituency it be next door to mine and both wind farm she mention she say quite rightly that for all the expansion in those technology over recent year very few of those job particularly in manufacturing have be in this country we will do everything we can through great british energy and the clean industry bonus we have announce today to grow our domestic supply chain build industry in this country and win job for britain last week just day after the budget apache announce that it would exit the north sea by it say the onerous financial impact of the energy profit levy make production beyond uneconomic what assessment have the government make of the impact of those policy on current job in north east scotland and how will great british energy compensate for the loss of those job we be work with industry in the north east of scotland to ensure that this be just and prosperous transition we have announce our next step of respond to court judgment and consultation be open at the moment we will have more to say about that in the month ahead the hon lady must recognise that if she want to see investment from great british energy she might actually have to support its creation in the first place the conservatives can not have it both way either they want public energy company to invest in the job of the future we do or they do not as her right hon friend have just confirm from the back benches she can not have it both way topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility the budget be major step forward pave the way for investment in clean home grow power create job and deliver energy security last week the national energy system operator provide definitive evidence that our clean power mission be achievable and can give we great energy security and low energy cost the conservatives have spend the past year argue for system that would keep the british people lock into energy insecurity and high cost while they be lock in argument about the past we be get on with deliver low bill energy security and good job for the british people the price cap rise winter fuel payment cut high standing charge and low temperature be all thing that my constituent in edinburgh west particularly my pensioner be come to with concern about what be the secretary of state planning to do to work with ofgem and the energy company to come up with fair set of circumstance for my constituent and other in similar situation we be look to bring down standing charge the hon lady have mention lot of case where people be struggle we appreciate that and we be do what we can the budget set out how we be go to protect the most vulnerable people and ensure that people be support in the way they need to be we have lot to do after year of conservative government we be try to unravel that and support people our push for clean energy by will lead to low bill and that be what we will be work on follow on from the exciting announcement of the billion investment in wind power it would be remiss of not to mention the severn estuary to the west of weston super mare with its transformative potential for the generation of clean renewable energy the potential of domestic energy have be neglect for far too long in world where global energy market and the cost of living be turbulent do the minister agree that the conservative party appear to have learn absolutely nothing during its time in office preside over the bad cost of live crisis in generation and fail to act order topical question should be short and punchy be sure you be go to get to the end of your question any minute now can urge the minister to go far and fast in deliver clean power for our community which the neso report so clearly state would lead to low bill and energy security my hon friend be right there be good project right across the country that we hope to invest in in the lead up to deliver in the neso report clearly set out that our aim be achievable the conservative party want to continue have the argument of the past we be determined with

carbon emission target even high that be despite the fact that we contribute only of global emission while the leader of the world highest emit country make up over of emission be not attend the climate change committee have say that this target will require for example an accelerated shift away from meat and dairy less travel and gas boiler ban for the british people yet the government approach would see our reliance on import from china which be power by coal go through the roof do the minister agree that an approach that be ask for more sacrifice and hardship from the british people in return for more good from one of the world large carbon emitter would mean few job in britain and more carbon in the atmosphere too long think the shadow secretary of state need to seek debate if she want to elaborate on these issue have attend cop last year as part of cross party delegation find it incredibly depressing to see the way the uk be receive it be really important that we be step up and show global ambition reach net zero in this country and get to clean power by be massive opportunity not cost some former miner in cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy be rightly delighted that our government have return over billion from the mineworker pension scheme to those who power our country for decade do the minister have plan to deliver similar justice to the member of the british

supply wood to burn at drax power station at cost of million day in subsidy while pensioner will perish this winter do the minister agree that it be time to end this net zero madness and admit that fossil fuel be gift of the god it perhaps will not surprise the hon gentleman or the house that be not go to agree with his final point net zero be incredibly important to deliver climate leadership

excellent science expertise that have be build up in jet over the past decade get to see the jet project when visit culham there be huge potential for cluster there many more company be be attract to that sector my hon friend be right that we need to maximise the skill that be there but be confident have speak to company that have be attract to culham and have speak to international company too that we will continue to do so many home in my constituency be off grid which mean that their owner have to fill up the tank at the beginning of winter to keep warm the pensioner who have lose the winter fuel payment be struggle with that up front amount will the minister review the level at which the winter fuel payment be remove because the most vulnerable be struggle we be do everything we

freedom and human right in azerbaijan include for my hon friend constituent conservative members will never stop hold the government to account for their pre election promise to cut energy bill by have civil service official conduct any modelling whatsoever that can legitimise that figure we arrive at the figure through independent analysis we stand by the reality that the only way to bring down bill be to commit to our target the national energy system operator back that but the conservative party fail to support that action the hon member therefore must explain what the conservative plan be for reduce bill for people who be pay more than they have ever pay my constituent understand that tackle the climate crisis and get low bill go hand in hand and they be excited about great british energy will gbe invest in community energy project in place such as macclesfield my hon friend be right to make point about community energy the local power plan that we be commit to will deliver community energy project throughout great britain be sure that macclesfield have some fantastic project that great british energy will look at we want to unleash the potential of community energy across the country national grid rationale for rebuild east claydon substation be base on speculative application not consent real scheme will the minister therefore meet to find way to get national grid more ground in reality rather than speculation be happy to look at specific case but the secretary of state role as final decision maker on some planning application mean that can not comment on they however generally speak the hon member make an important point about look at how we plan project holistically throughout the country that be why we have announce the first ever spatial energy plan for the whole of great britain the devastating scene of flooding in spain remind we all of why urgent investment be need to deal with the deadly consequence of climate change do the minister agree that that investment should be pay for by the pollute company that have cause the climate crisis we hope that at in the come week we can settle on figure for new ambitious goal which will not just bring in finance from donor country but mobilise private sector finance we will use all the mechanism we can to ensure that we get money to develop country as quickly as possible as my hon friend say it be more urgent than ever to act order have get to get all member in and ministers have get to help and work with bolney and twineham parishe in my constituency host the rampion windfarm substation which lead to several battery energy storage solution application what reassurance can the minister give my constituent about the adequacy of the regulatory framework battery will play an important role in our energy mix in the short duration storage that we need we will continue to look at whether the regulatory arrangement be sufficient obviously we want all the application to be for safe project the regulation be in place to ensure that if we need to do any more work we will happily look at that we have very successful all party group meeting last week on float offshore wind in the celtic sea know the minister be supportive and ask he to consider mechanism such as ringfencing contract for difference and investment in port to kickstart the investment in the celtic sea my hon friend be right to raise the important potential of the celtic sea in our green energy transition will be in wales tomorrow to speak at green energy conference on exactly that question there be huge potential in float offshore wind we want to bring the manufacture job in the supply chain to this country as well which be why we launch today our clean industry bonus to bring that investment here to build the factory of the future and deliver the good clean job of the future the wind industry have rightly agree standard compensation package for rural community with big wind plant the solar industry however be unsurprisingly busy whitewash uyghur slave labour in its supply chain rather than do that if it will not act will the government step forward and recognise that they must support rural community by create standardised compensation programme the hon lady have pursue this and several other issue to do with the solar industry for long time we be currently look at all the option particularly around community benefit to ensure that they be at scale follow on from the previous government consultation on whether they should be compulsory that genuinely benefit community my constituent konnie huq with arts council and lottery funding have compile kid climate guide with jamie oliver among the contributor will ministers join force with she to get it out there preferably to every school in the country because we have get to start young would be more than happy to meet with my hon friend and her constituent who sound rather familiar to discuss what more we can do to support climate education among child include in our school meet with national grid yesterday and communicate my concern about the norwich to tilbury line but we remain constructive and talk about community benefit scheme unfortunately it tell that the government be drag their foot on define community benefit scheme can the minister update the house on when they will bring forward guidance and can he promise that community benefit scheme be real positive economic benefit for my resident who be impact by the pylon clearly can not speak for national grid but can speak for this government and in four month we have move as quickly as possible on what community benefit scheme will look like for network infrastructure as well as for generation project the conservative party have year to put in place different scheme and do not in four month we be move as quickly as we can as minister know the european powerhouse of critical mineral be cornwall include its vast quantity of lithium essential for our transition away from fossil fuel will the ministers agree with the industry call for target of tonne of lithium thank my hon friend for his question and look forward to meet he shortly to talk about tin among other thing we be look at our critical mineral strategy there be big role to play in his neck of the wood for lithium and tin and we will be push that as hard as we can ahead of the general election the labour party be warn that its plan for the north sea in scotland would lead to up to scottish job loss last week this become reality when the us oil firm apache say that it would end all its operation in the north sea by the end of cite this uk government budget and tax regime can the minister explain why this uk government see the job and livelihood of oil and gas worker in the north east of scotland as expendable do not believe that at all this government be commit to just and prosperous transition the reality be that job have be lose in the oil and gas industry in the past year if we do not recognise that there be transition under way and put in place the measure to produce the job of the future we will have more loss the party that the hon member represent could have do something about that by support great british energy headquarters in aberdeen but he fail to show up and vote for it declare an interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group for critical mineral domestic supply of copper and of course cornish tin be critical to the uk energy security what consideration have the minister give to ensure that copper and tin be recognise as critical mineral the process in term of what be on the list of critical mineral be independent but have strong interest as do my hon friend in ensure that we produce as many critical mineral here as we can and that the supply chain around the world be work for we be look at critical mineral strategy which will come forward in due course point of order pm on point of order mr speaker minister have repeatedly say today that the neso report show that their plan will lower energy bill but page of the report make it clear that no such thing will happen if minister read their own report and realise that they have mislead the house would it be appropriate for they to come back and apologise be not responsible for ministers answer but be sure ministers will have hear that point of order and if they wish to correct the record they can do so social security advisory committee winter fuel payment urgent question to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions when she plan to respond to the social security advisory committee letter publish on october on the means testing of winter fuel payment we welcome the letter from the chair of the social security advisory committee we be hop to respond to the letter on the day of the budget regrettably there have be an unexpected further delay and we be due to issue the response this week however my official meet the committee in august to discuss the regulation prior to the committee formal scrutiny in early september want to explain briefly why it be important to invoke the urgency procedure in this case we need to make the necessary exchequer saving in the current financial year as the regulation need to come into force on september the previous government leave we with billion black hole with treasury reserve spend three time over the day to day departmental spending set out by the previous government in their spring budget be not even close to reality it be now up to we to clear up the mess of the previous government so we have to take some difficult decision such as mean test the winter fuel payment but we remain determined to do everything possible to support the poor pensioner we have take immediate action to increase the take up of pension credit work with charity and local authority and through campaign in print and broadcast medium the government have write to more than million pensioner about the change to means test the winter fuel payment we have also write to pensioner on housing benefit who could be entitle to pension credit to encourage they to claim we have extend the household support fund until march thank to our steadfast commitment to the triple lock more than million pensioner will see their state pension rise by up to next year and up to over the course of this parliament the warm home discount which we hear about minute ago be worth off energy bill for low income household the warm home plan will in the long term insulate million more home by take these difficult decision we be able to provide cash injection of billion to the nhs budget which be the large real term growth in day to day nhs spending outside of covid since that will bring down waiting time for people across the country include many pensioner we be take the responsible and difficult decision to clear up the mess of the previous government to fix the foundation of our economy and rebuild our public service call the shadow secretary of state thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question this government make choice to take away the winter fuel payment from million pensioner this winter and to rely on the notoriously under claim pension credit as system of means test it that choice will make life hard for pensioner across the country it will see of the poor pensioner miss out on much need help with the cost of heating and accord to the labour party own research it could lead to additional death this winter the government know that that be why they have not do an impact assessment perhaps it be why after seven week they still have not respond to the concern of their own advisory committee the committee write the secretary of state letter contain its concern about how the policy will affect the poor people it say that of disabled pensioner will miss out on their payment this winter and it suggest expand the eligibility for winter fuel payment beyond pension credit because the committee know that the government saving be base on third of the poor pensioner miss out in direct contrast to the government the committee say that more detailed assessment be urgently require as colleague from all part of the house include labour members charity and pensioner group across the country have also say here we be seven week later and the secretary of state be yet to even respond to the advisory committee in fact she be not even here to answer this urgent question ask the minister will the government now after seven week respond to their own advisory committee will they now after seven week publish full impact assessment for everyone to see do she accept that her government have get this wrong do she recognise that they have negligently underestimate how many people will fall through the crack suspect that deep down she be worried as be about pensioner who can not afford to heat their home be sure her secretary of state have be lobby the chancellor behind the scene perhaps that be where she be right now instead of be here will the hon lady go back to her chancellor one more time and try to make she think again do apologise for the delay in respond to the committee letter it be regrettable the initial delay as set out be because we be wait for the obr to come forward with its costing of the policy then there be another unexpected delay there have be do not know why be be heckled be try calmly to explain why there have be delay for which do apologise we will issue response very shortly and certainly by the end of the week it be important that we respond to that letter respect that the hon lady be ask that question regard the public sector equality duty we have do everything in line with the duty which be to provide an equality analysis of the decision that we have take as hon member will know that analysis be publish in september however say this gently after the election we find ourselves in situation of have billion black hole with treasury reserve spend three time over the obr have say that its assessment of the previous government budget would have be materially different have it know the pressure on spending and the real situation in the treasury note that the hon lady do not come with an apology we have have to take the decision to mean test winter fuel payment we do not want to do that but we have have to take some difficult decision to clear up the mess to tackle our fiscal inheritance and to start rebuild our public service which pensioner across the country and many other rely on government members will obviously not take protestation about poverty from the conservative party with anything other than mountain of salt but the government spend billion per year and the cut to winter fuel allowance will save the government about billion per year so that cut will save about of government spending on that basis as we look at all the welcome advance make in the labour budget all the great stuff that we can talk about and we consider that this measure save only of government spending really urge the minister to think again think the public would welcome that as sign of real leadership not anyone or any government always get it right and believe we get it wrong on this occasion could the government rethink on this issue be proud of the last labour government record of lift over million pensioner out of poverty we do expect to make saving of about billion this year through means test the winter fuel payment that be not an insignificant proportion of the billion of saving that the chancellor set out on july we come to the liberal democrat spokesperson many of we in the chamber accept that the new government inherit financial mess from the old government it be pity that that be be balance on the back of pensioner the minister quite rightly highlight how many of we have be champion our resident to claim pension credit as be in torbay she talk of unexpected delay many of we include her own department face unexpected delay in the light of that will she extend the deadline for pensioner to claim the allowance beyond december thank the hon gentleman for that question be afraid that can not commit to extend the deadline it be important that we encourage as many pensioner as possible know that he be work on that in his constituency and do pension credit surgery in my constituency last week to check whether they be eligible for pension credit we have local authority up and down the country help we to check the eligibility of those in need and those on the low income that be the right thing to do those claim can be backdate by three month and anyone who be eligible for pension credit in the qualifying week will also be passporte to other benefit such as the winter fuel payment the advisory committee make several recommendation relate to get assistance to people who should be in receipt of pension credit could the minister indicate whether the government intend to accept those recommendation we be deploy an additional staff to deal with the substantial increase over claim that be the right thing to do it be an operational focus for the department to get through those claim as quickly as possible to make sure that we get the help to those most in need the social security advisory committee estimate that more than of people with disability will lose their winter fuel payment this year do the hon lady really think that cut benefit from this vulnerable group of pensioner be the right thing to do if the hon lady look at the equality analysis she will see that those with disability will be disproportionately likely to retain the winter fuel payment urge she to have look at that thank my hon friend for her response to the urgent question we have budget that do so much good for our country in the face of the most dreadful inheritance and the labour government should be congratulate on that but pensioner in middlesbrough and thornaby east be still look to the government to far mitigate the impact of the cut to the winter fuel payment much have be do by the elect mayor chris cooke to embrace the issue around the household support fund and so on but the social security advisory committee note that the billion be base on an increase of only in pension credit take up from to could the minister say what the increase in take up have be to date and what further step she will take to provide yet further mitigation and reduce pensioner poverty we will announce new statistic at the end of this month the committee ask about the increase that assumption be base on what happen when the previous government take away free tv licence and people have to apply for they the obr accept our assumption what be the point of have social security advisory committee if the government do not listen to and take its advice would it not be well to abolish the committee if the government be intent on ignore it no be reassure by the minister response that we will soon see reply to that letter my constituent be not fool they can see that while opposition party oppose the cut they be not propose how they would fund the payment my constituent also see the desperate lack of people claim pension credit put on the record my thank to age scotland for its guidance to my staff on how to ensure that more people in my constituency claim it the letter refer to winter fuel payment claimant in england wales the eu switzerland iceland lichtenstein and norway but not scotland be that because in scotland the scottish government have the power both to maintain the winter fuel payment and to fully fund it yes as understand it that be in the scottish government gift have the minister have the chance to visit the dwp library and have she make note of how many drive there have be over the year to take up pension credit and whether any of they ever reach as high even as three quarter of those who be eligible the previous government promise year ago to merge housing benefit with pension credit which would be significant advance towards improvement we be introduce that in january we will have be in power for only six month but we will have do more than the previous government do in year many pensioner be terrify of go into debt and do not want to switch on their heating in case they end up with massive bill temperature will drop below freezing in scotland at the beginning of next week so will the minister apologise to those pensioner across scotland who will not be able to put the heating on because they fear go into debt urge the hon lady to look at the support available to low income household through the warm home discount scheme the extension of the household support fund and our commitment to the triple lock which will ensure that million pensioner see rise in their pension of up to next year and over the course of this parliament in the long term urge she to look at the detail of the warm home plan which will transform home across the country by make they clean and cheap to heat on september the minister department tell in response to write question that people in my constituency have be eligible for winter fuel payment while we be proud to offer forever home to so many pensioner that be preposterous figure relate to heartless and unnecessary decision that will cost more in the long term how do or any of my resident have confidence in what the government be do since they believe that more than half my constituency be make up pensioner and can not even get the basic number right quote one of the hon lady fellow politician have people in my constituency tell that they do need the winter fuel payment that we give they because they can afford it those be the word of the leader of the opposition the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch the social security advisory committee letter call for an urgent amendment to allow those in receipt of pensioner housing benefit to receive the winter fuel payment this year believe the uk government should go far extend eligibility to people on council tax support attendance allowance disability living allowance personal independent payment and carer allowance will the uk government rethink their position on eligibility and reduce pensioner hardship this winter the hon lady question allow to focus on the communication around this change it be not just about pension credit but about people on work tax credit child tax credit and other benefit the committee be concern about pensioner in receipt of child tax credit pensioner should check whether they be eligible for other qualifying benefit for winter fuel payment because it be quite complicated system it be not just about whether someone be already on pension credit the government say that they want everyone who be eligible for pension credit to claim it and get it but as the social security advisory committee point out they expect only increase in uptake be the reality not that the government need hundred of thousand of pensioner not to claim this entitlement that they deserve in order to make their figure add up and to cut billion from winter fuel payment would be very pleased if all pensioner who be eligible for pension credit apply and receive the help that they deserve the minister will be aware that billion of pound in benefit and financial help include pension credit go unclaimed every year due to the stigma associate with claim benefit and the huge difficulty that claimant encounter when navigate the system what measure be the government take to encourage great take up and to simplify the benefit system we have run several campaign the late of which be launch recently on radio and tv and in print medium to urge those who may be eligible to apply and to urge their love one to encourage they and help they to apply we have also ask official to see how we can improve the form to make it easy but more than of claim be now make online pensioner can get help either from love one or from charity and local authority which be help to ensure that they get the support that they deserve some pensioner in broxbourne will lose their winter fuel payment how be the minister help those who can not do online application for pension credit to make an application will she commit to continue to write to all those who will lose their winter fuel payment until they sign up for pension credit we have write to all pensioner to tell they about the change in government policy to ensure that those who be not in receipt of pension credit or other benefit know that they will not be get the winter fuel payment this winter minister it be always good to have the necessary answer the report note saving of billion the increase in pension credit take up from to represent an additional household any take up negate saving make by the government the fact be that pensioner who would qualify have lose out this year and be struggle now what can be do to expedite their application and to deal with the long waiting list for decision which mean that for many the potential for additional income to ease their situation and help in the winter month will be too little too late the reason make the point be that the system be take too long to make decision and those people need the money right now as say we have redeploy an additional member of staff to process application for pension credit and we be mostly hit the target for processing time national youth strategy with permission mr speaker will now make statement on our new national youth strategy the challenge face young people today be profound they live through pandemic during which they be deny the chance to test boundary and gain confidence they be at the sharp end of revolution in social medium the pressure on young girl be significant the effect of antisocial behaviour and violence be stark and while talent be everywhere opportunity be

opportunity to volunteer that be what young people tell we they want as part of the national youth guarantee we allocate million to youth facility improve and develop of they we welcome the government commitment to the youth investment fund project that be under way but will the secretary of state confirm the fate of those that be not in government we deliver billion worth of sport programme develop and improve sport pitch across the country can she confirm that they will still be invest in give their importance as resource for young people of course the importance that we place on young people go much far whether the issue be housing the national living wage education or apprenticeship we listen to their view at the very top of government that be why we welcome some of the measure in the statement such as the focus that the government will place on youth worker through the local youth transformation pilot the relationship between youth worker and young people be one of the most important especially for young people with challenging background one element that we can not support however be the scrapping of the national citizen service the ncs have grow since when it first support participant over the last year more than young people have take part in its programme have the pleasure of visit many of they and what strike most be the sight of people from mix of different background come together it be great scheme which have cross party support if the government intend to listen to young people can the secretary of state explain why it be scrap scheme with which of participant be satisfied she say that we do not need citizenship because of social medium but would argue that we probably do the cancellation of the ncs also mean that hole will develop in youth service be deliver in so can the secretary of state tell what immediate action will be take to prevent it from develop and how she intend to spend the million of saving that she have announce or be that loss to the sector the ncs be not the only scheme that be be scrap do not need to remind the house of the importance of cadet both to their community and to young people especially follow the remembrance service that take place yesterday and over the weekend it be great shame that the government have cut grant funding for cadet and hope the secretary of state will reconsider that as for the issue of dormant asset this be money that we announce in government but may ask how quickly that funding will be in the hand of those who need it give young people the good start in life be something about which and know many other member care passionately assure the secretary of state that we will work constructively with she when we see opportunity to improve service but we will also challenge it when we think that she have make the wrong decision be sorry to say that in my view the cancellation of the national citizen service be the wrong choice thank the right hon gentleman for his constructive challenge welcome he to his place and look forward to more of this in the come month and year the right hon gentleman ask about grassroots sport funding and the facility that we make available around the country he will have note that over the summer announce that the government would invest in that significantly and that we provide further detail follow the euros where whole generation be inspire not just by the man team but by the incredible success of the lionesses and many other sport besides we know how important this be we have make commitment to ensure that that funding match the demand that be be place on we by young people in particular as for the importance of youth worker could not agree more with the right hon gentleman do not want to get into an arm race about who care more about this issue but the truth be where the last government leave we good inheritance we will acknowledge it support it and ensure that it continue be sure the right hon gentleman will rightly agree that the challenge face young people be far too important for we to play party politic with they hope that young people will recognise from this exchange that they have group of parliamentarian who be determined to work together to get this right and who will challenge one another when they think they be not do so the right hon gentleman refer to the million cost of ncs we be work with the ncs trust to ensure that we manage the closure in an orderly fashion and that all associate cost be meet the department be currently engage in business planning process however he will have hear what have say in the house previously and what will continue to say to colleague today we recognise the funding challenge that affect the entire youth sector the series of announcement that have make today include the announcement about dormant asset funding be intend to ensure that we start to put rocket booster behind young people the right hon gentleman ask about other youth organisation and in particular about uniformed youth we do intend to increase funding for some of those organisation especially those that have receive funding previously through the national citizen service to ensure that no gap be leave that would prevent they from be able to honour the commitment that they make to young people as for the general question why the want to impress on the right hon gentleman that we be strong supporter of the dedicated programme for young people that be establish by the cameron government be also strong supporter of vinspired which precede it but the incoming government at the time decide that they want to move with the time and want to change the programme what we have learn from that episode be that an orderly transition be very important with vinspired the funding be cut but the programme continue and it finally close in with more than half million pound of debt we be determined not to allow that to happen again which be why we be work closely with the ncs trust and other to make sure we do this properly however have responsibility to million of young people around the country and think it only right to say that the system be far too fragmented and not align with their priority make no apology for put they back at the centre of government where they belong welcome the government commitment to bring youth service together and we in the all party parliamentary group on youth affair which chair look forward to play our part however owe to the reduction in youth service at local level local group such as croydon youth consortium in my constituency have have to step up where local government have step back will the secretary of state ensure that the government will leverage rather than work against the good practice that those group have establish by work together and not compete against each other for certain type of funding welcome my hon friend commitment to young people which be know about before her election have deliberately place an emphasis on what happen at local and regional level as this government seek to embark on the big devolution of power out of westminster and whitehall in generation we must ensure that young people be empower to play their full part not just with national government but with local and regional government as well we announce funding for the local youth transformation fund to help local authority learn from the good practice in this area be also very committed as be the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my hon friend the member for barnsley south stephanie peacock to ensure that we be in town village and city across the uk listen to the experience of young people who face very different challenge in their life depend on where they be from but who have also find extremely innovative solution look forward to work with my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons and other colleague to make good that commitment call the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome today announcement national youth strategy can finally bring the join up thinking that be need to deliver the outcome that our young people deserve on the point about put rocket booster behind young people those kind of high octane opportunity be not available at the youth club that attend but it sound like an innovative form of youth work have see the result that can be achieve by youth work when an effective approach be take one success story be that of cheltenham festivals which support ten of thousand of young people in the art and culture every year know that the secretary of state learn more when cheltenham festivals recently visit downing street and she get to meet supertato one of her hero what role be there for organisation such as cheltenham festivals as part of the strategy do the secretary of state agree that in order to deliver long term join up strategic thinking now be the time for cabinet minister for child and young people as call for by the liberal democrats will whatever follow the ncs continue to report to her department or another perhaps the ministry of housing communities and local government if local council be to have broad role the scale of the mental health crisis among young people in this country give we pause for thought every day will the secretary of state take this opportunity to commit that this government will deliver dedicated mental health professional in every primary and secondary school the physical health of our child and young people be also in urgent need of support as we seek to fight childhood obesity will the secretary of state announcement on dormant asset funding bring any benefit in the area of sport and physical activity it be indeed pleasure to meet supertato at the recent reception that we host in downing street know mr speaker get the reference but be not sure that anybody else do supertato be legend welcome the hon gentleman emphasis on cheltenham festivals and on art and culture we think that every child and young person in this country have the right to rich large life and he will have see that one of the first thing that the education secretary and announce be review of the curriculum in order to put art creativity sport and music back at its heart for too many young people the experience of the last decade and half have be of art culture and sport disappear not just from their classroom but from their community and we be determined to set that right the hon gentleman ask specific question about have cabinet minister for child and young people be pleased to tell he that we have one he be know as the prime minister have work for the children society and centrepoint when the last labour government be in office my learning in this area be that although it be great innovation to have department for children schools and families the every child matters programme be able to succeed only because there be strong direction from the prime minister that every single cabinet minister have to play their part hope that the hon gentleman can see that through the work we be announce today we be absolutely determined to ensure that declare an interest for nearly year have be the chair of trustee at the samuel montagu youth club in my constituency and have also be senior play leader on an adventure playground and youth worker the funding that my right hon friend have announce today will be welcome by the youth work sector particularly the million of overdue capital and the million for youth club but may make an appeal to she have be down this road many time before with government funding and the burden of bureaucracy when apply for money can sometimes exclude small organisation that just do not have the capacity can we make it simple for people to apply for the money look forward to visit an adventure playground with my hon friend sometime soon could not agree with he more and he be absolutely right to flag this issue to we be keen to make the interface between young people youth organisation and the government as painless as possible particularly to ensure that we support local grassroots organisation that be achieve absolute magic with young people we be work with the devolved administrations the local government association mayor council and other to get it right but would be very pleased to discuss this issue with my hon friend at time that be mutually convenient to make sure that we do call the chair of the select committee thank the secretary of state for her statement she be right to focus on this issue and there be lot of positive here if have any concern they be around the speed of the closure of the national citizen service and not know what will replace it that could lead to gap in provision but also to some of the skilled and dedicated youth worker on whom we rely leave the workforce she speak about an orderly transition and she be absolutely right do so have few of question for she what be the estimate cost of wind down the ncs would it be possible for it to continue without public funding if it be able to get access to private finance how long do she estimate that it will take before money for either exist or new youth project become available and when do she think they could be up and run thank the hon lady for her question our intention be to close the ncs but we must go through all the necessary step include engagement with his majesty the king as require and with parliament she will know that it will take some time to pass the necessary legislation but our intention be to honour the exist funding round until march the hon lady ask about the cost of wind down ncs we have do some provisional work on that but we be work closely with the ncs board and trust to make sure that we fully understand the implication of those cost and that we do this in the most cost effective way with value for money she also ask whether it would be possible to continue with the ncs but without government funding we be very much mark by the experience of the last government and the closure of vinspired without forward look and viable business plan we be concerned that we would end up repeat the mistake make under the last government as say to the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew vinspired eventually close with significant amount of debt we have look at every different scenario and the hon lady will appreciate that this be not decision that we take lightly but we have come to the conclusion that it be the right thing for young people it be right to be clear that we be close the ncs this will be the last round of funding and we will legislate after go through the necessary process welcome the secretary of state important statement think we in this chamber all agree that support the next generation of people in my town of harlow and across the country be really important may make plea to she it be really important to hear young people voice in this process but what step will she take to make sure that young people who be often forget and leave behind be hear have work for charity that support young carer can say from personal experience that their voice must be hear as well thank my hon friend for his question and pay tribute to he for the work he be do and for stand up for group of young people who mean great deal to too have work for the children society they have often lack voice it be fantastic to see he in his place and to know that they have strong voice in he we be work with full range of youth organisation draw on the relationship that we have across the department to make sure that we reach the right young people we be in the process of establish youth advisory group which be help to make sure that we reach the wide range of young people in every part of the country and make commitment to my hon friend that we will specifically include young carer in that group be pleased that the secretary of state statement talk of widen the creative careers programme as the chair of the all party parliamentary group for perform art education and proud graduate of chichester university with creative degree be live proof that creative degree can take people many place include parliament be sure the culture secretary agree that the narrow nature of the english baccalaureate be reduce the take up of creative qualification among our young people how soon can we expect reform in that area the education secretary have lay out the term of the curriculum review and waste no time in appoint the chair of the review and that work be under way as well as make sure that all young people have access to broad curriculum my department be work with many of the organisation that member have describe such as the royal shakespeare company we be see the great work that be already happen in community and school and consider how good we can make sure that all school and all child can get access to incredible opportunity we know that child and young people have be wait too long to access such opportunity so we be look at the broad range of way to address that as quickly as possible my promise to the hon lady be that we will not waste minute thank my right hon friend for her magnificent statement which be so timely and overdue think every one of we in the chamber will know from their own constituency just how important youth service be and how they have be stretch over many year there be so many tremendous supplier and player in this area but local authority play huge role could she say little bit more about how she expect they to deal with any additional statutory responsibility and critically about the funding need to deliver absolutely essential service not just for young people but for our wide community know that my hon friend have great deal of expertise in this area have support young people in his constituency for long time we be acutely aware of the challenge face local authority as former councillor myself and with experience in the youth sector know the enormous frustration when more and more responsibility be place on local authority without the necessary support and funding to match that be one of the reason we have make today announcement about the local youth transformation fund we think that many local authority need help not just with funding but with ensure that young people be at the centre of their youth offer to go back to the challenge that my hon friend the member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford lay down we must also make sure that we be hear the full range of voice from young people in those forum some local authority be do fantastic job and have be extremely receptive to do more we be determined to learn from the good and ensure that every local authority in the country be put young people at the heart of what they do early the secretary of state say that some funding would be protect for uniformed youth organisation could she spell out which organisation will not be receive funding give that the government have announce cut to the cadet force may appeal to she to put somebody from either the sea cadets the army cadets or the air training corps on the advisory board and to reassure the house that there be no institutional or departmental bias against young people wear uniform have hear the right hon gentleman loud and clear and absolutely wholeheartedly give he that commitment this be personal for in my own town of wigan an enormous number of young people join the cadet and other uniformed group every year and we be tremendously proud of they it be privilege to be at the cenotaph with his majesty the king this sunday and to meet some of the cadet from dulwich who do such fantastic job of welcome the royal family and make that day success it be our intention to honour all exist funding commitment but we be plan to increase some funding stream particularly to ensure that there be no detrimental impact on young people from the decision to close the national citizen service that include increase funding to some uniformed group and will be in position to set out the specific of that to the house once my department have go through business planning will also take the hon gentleman suggestion about put member of those uniformed group on the advisory board be sure we can manage to make that work be look over at my official and they be nod agreeably will take that suggestion away and thank he for it the secretary of state rightly point out the amazing work that trust adult and youth worker do today the average youth contract be about nine month how will we address that in the national youth strategy as well as support youth worker to access qualification to help they thrive and support our young people my hon friend point to very relevant problem in the year since be in the youth sector do not think that problem have get any less acute it force organisation to reinvent the wheel constantly or to stop do work that be incredibly valuable as the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew point out early the relationship between youth worker and young person be incredibly valuable and important to protect and my hon friend the under secretary and be well aware of that would be amazed if it do not come up through the call for evidence to young people the consultation be be design by they for they and would be amazed if that issue do not form part of the recommendation that we take forward into the national youth strategy in the unlikely event that it do not however we will absolutely make sure that we deal with that concern have hear my hon friend loud and clear welcome the statement from the secretary of state and fully support her aim to provide fit for purpose and effective support to the young people in our country one key component be the provision of sport and leisure facility for young people in september the dewsbury sport centre and swimming pool be close due to limited reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete last week attend full council meeting in which the labour cabinet decide to close the dewsbury sport centre permanently cite repair cost of million to million and the lack of million in run cost the impact of the closure on my constituent include thousand of young people be catastrophic will the secretary of state meet to discuss how the government can help with the reopening of the dewsbury sport centre as soon as possible welcome the hon gentleman to his place do not think have have the opportunity to congratulate he since he be elect this government be very committed to make sure that we provide the sport and leisure facility that young people across the country be clamour for have see for myself in every part of the country how much it improve young people confidence and educational outcome and also how it provide they with the opportunity to live rich large life be very strike at the olympics and paralympics this summer by just how many of those athlete start out in the sort of leisure facility that he describe however we do young people disservice if we be not honest with they about the problem and their cause the hon gentleman know as well as do that council around the country be not clamour to close down their leisure facility those council have have the bad funding settlement from government in live memory and they be deal with the human cost of that in their community every day they be on the frontline deal with that congratulate those councillor who be prepared to go out and be honest with people about the challenge that they face and to seek innovative solution give the hon gentleman commitment that will work with his council to help achieve our shared ambition of make sure that young people in dewsbury get the opportunity that they deserve thank the secretary of state for her statement she like be great champion for young people and be glad to hear her comment and commitment today about the new national youth strategy this funding will be lifeline to youth worker and to youth organisation such as the burnley boys and girls club participation works and other operate in burnley padiham and brierfield as she say local authority funding fall by over over the past year and because of that there be less space for young people to operate in and do what they want to do note her commitment to million of extra capital funding so will she ensure that scheme in burnley padiham and brierfield be fully consider will she meet and partner in burnley to talk about the potential for our already part fund youth zone pay tribute to the burnley boys and girls club we in wigan like it so much that we go out and get one of our own and it have become the onside youth zone which do fantastic work with the community that be really good example of public private partnership where the council and the business community be jointly invest in the future of young people and our youth zone stand in the centre of wigan as shin testament to how much young people matter to they know that that be my hon friend ambition for young people in burnley and would be more than happy to work with he to make that reality the secretary of state be right the world have change and with the enormous prevalence now of electronica and social medium there be big premium than ever on get more young people out play sport do music join uniformed group and get involve in all sort of purposeful activity even perhaps public speaking and debating we need to make sure that we make full use of the asset and facility we have and successive government have try to get school to open up more in some area we have have renew progress with the holiday activity and food programme and wraparound care but what more can be do to ensure that those great facility throughout the country be fully utilise it be long time since the right hon gentleman and be on the education committee together and lot have change in that time we be very open to the suggestion of work more closely with school to ensure that those tremendous facility be open to more young people would say to he though that we do not think that that be the entire answer because there be young people who do not feel comfortable or confident in school part of the thrust of the work that have do and the funding that have announce today be to ensure that young people have space that belong to they where they feel that they have stake and some sense of ownership for so many young people that be the key to access service on their term not ours that genuinely help to transform their life but be very open to the suggestion that we could do more by work with school would not want opposition member to misunderstand what we be say about citizenship active citizenship be incredibly important for young people in fact there be no future to this country unless they have the opportunity to contribute to the rebuilding of britain that be why we name the state of the nation report in the way we do and one reason genuinely feel from listen to opposition members that there be an opportunity for we to work together to deliver on the promise to this generation give the secretary of state my sincere and heartfelt thank for the focus of her statement have work with the youth sector to highlight the severe loss of professional youth worker job that occur under austerity serious revenue funding be need to fill this chasm so can she give an estimate of the number of new permanent youth worker post that revenue funding will create under these plan will have to write to the hon lady on that point but echo what she say as say in my statement building be of no use without the army of adult who work with child and young people those relationship be hard fought and that trust be hard won and it be something we be determined to protect many year ago when work for the children society we hold the large consultation with child and young people we have ever run the message that come through from every single submission be the importance of good strong relationship and of have trust adult in their life be horrify when see dcms research show that so many young people in this country do not have single adult they would trust with their problem we be determined to change that but will write to the hon lady on that specific point thank the right hon lady for her generous comment about the thatcher government children act and for say that she will dedicate million to youth outcome over the next four year do she therefore share my concern which be sure may resonate with many young people that we now know that more than million have be waste on the ludicrous high speed bat tunnel do that not show the importance of this house take control of spend priority in order to prevent such waste in the future be not sure whether that will form the centrepiece of what young people tell we in the consultation but reassure the hon gentleman that this government take value for money very seriously although would not suggest for moment that there be not huge value in the national citizen service one reason for today difficult decision be that far too much youth focus spending across government be too fragmented and not align with the challenge this generation face as they have tell we loud and clear we be determined that that will change too extend my thank to the secretary of state for her statement and the promise of investment in this vital area one of the great thing about the ncs accord to my child be the time spend outdoors be sure she will agree that outdoor play area be vital not only for physical wellbeing but for mental wellbeing leicester south have some great outdoor play area and adventure playground include highfields and st andrews unfortunately both be under threat of closure due to lack of funding do the secretary of state agree that outdoor play area and adventure playground be vital for our child wellbee what specific investment will there be for adventure playground will she talk to her colleague to ensure that any new housing project make provision for outdoor play area many year ago the government have national play strategy which my hon friend the member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin will probably remember since then there have be lack of focus on the opportunity for child to play will take away the hon gentleman point on housing and discuss it with my right hon friend the secretary of state for housing communities and local government my department have specific funding stream for adventure away from home which will be maintain will also look for other funding source that the hon gentleman and his constituent may be able to access to ensure that every child in leicester have the outdoor play experience and opportunity they deserve welcome the minister statement there be no one in the chamber who be not encourage by what she have say she will know that there be great disappointment that youth service do not appear to be prioritise in the budget early intervention allow child to go on to access training and apprenticeship direct they away from criminal influence and gang membership it give they the confidence and self assurance to combat mental health issue too be today statement an indication that youth investment be priority and that community group will not have to scrabble at the funding table will there be assistance for community group to access finance and help the hon gentleman will know that the government inherit disastrous economic situation and not only because of how the economy have be mismanage but because of the lack of investment in public service over long period of time this have mean that so many local council have focus on their statutory responsibility which have deeply affect youth service however the budget make number of announcement include my department creative career programme there be fast grow area of the economy in every nation and region and we be determined that not only will those community benefit from good job but young people in those community will have the opportunity to get those job be sick and tired of visit part of the country where job be be create that the kid can see from their school playground but can no more dream of get those opportunity than of go to the moon we be determined that this will change under this government power of attorney motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about last powers of attorney to place duty on bank in respect of last powers of attorney to make provision about the power of the office of the public guardian to investigate the action of an attorney to require the secretary of state to review the effectiveness of the power of the office of the public guardian to investigate the action of an attorney and of its use of those power to make provision about the duty of care home in respect of last powers of attorney to require an attorney to notify the office of the public guardian of the death of donor to require the office of the public guardian to take step to promote the facility to request search of its register of power of attorney and for connected purpose six year ago move the marriage and civil partnership consent bill under the ten minute rule this be the first legislative attempt to stop the practice of predatory marriage cruel form of abuse in which person marry an elderly or vulnerable person exclusively for the purpose of gain access to their estate upon death in the year since it have become clear that there be other way in which unscrupulous individual may target the elderly and vulnerable today ask the house to try to close one of these procedural gap that harm so many people the simplification of last power of attorney process in recent year be believe short sighted and will explain why if be to describe all the instance of abuse that have be share with in recent month would need far more than my allotted minute owe to the time constraint will therefore share the testimony of just four people who have consent to be name and be not subject to current legal proceeding the first be carolyn stephens whose elderly widow father meet woman in at first carolyn be pleased that her father have find new companion but she grow concerned when this woman begin answer her father phone over the next few year carolyn find herself systematically remove from her father life first her father be take to registry office where the woman try to marry he but the registrar refuse say that carolyn father do not have the capacity because he could not even answer basic question such as to provide his home address week later solicitor sign piece of paper that give the woman lpa over his finance property health and welfare and the power to completely remove his daughter carolyn from his life altogether after have have no contact for year have suffer from emotional distress accusation of abuse and harassment and have no knowledge of where her father live carolyn finally have breakthrough in december she find he on the electoral roll in care home the visit log show that her father be leave alone for day in without any visitor not even on his birthday even after she find her father the ordeal continue for several month eventually the authority act and carolyn be able to spend the last six month of her father life by his side another victim survivor be ann berry without discussion or notice ann be remove from both her partner lpa because the office of the public guardian have receive two partial deed of revocation apparently sign by he however because he have parkinson disease and lewy body dementia he have be unable even to sign cheque for at least the previous year that be report to the office of the public guardian but ann be deny access to screenshot of her partner signature to verify for two year the office of the public guardian be unhelpful and consistently slow to respond to ann her testimony show how such protective body often prove to be toothless to those who need they most another case be the story of sareeta mclachlan who have sadly not have the same resolution within two month of her mother be place in care home her brother stop sareeta and other family member from take she out for social and leisure activity five month later he ban they from see she altogether and the care home accept his instruction as he have lpa her brother claim sareeta be distress their mother by try to make her discuss financial affair and that their mother no long want to see she nine year later sareeta nightmare continue with no explanation give as to why certain family member can not visit other than her brother allege that be their mother wish my final case history be that of my constituent juliette hirst juliette mother be propose to by man after have be in relationship for just day over the follow year juliette mother be coerce into only be allow to speak on the phone if it be on loudspeaker not be permit to attend appointment alone and not be allow to decide which clothe she could buy or even wear this culminate in the inheritance from her mother late sister be transfer into joint account then into an isa in only the man name he spend it all on new car and on much more expensive house far away from the rest of the family then juliette mother receive terminal diagnosis at her mother request juliette and her family arrange for solicitor to visit to get her mum affair in order however the husband would not allow the visit without he be present he stop feed or bath juliette mother and would not even help she to get to the toilet when juliette mother lie die in st gemma hospice in my constituency the husband buy another new car for and transfer into his bank account from their joint account while she be bed bind almost as soon as juliette mother have die the husband immediately move new woman into their flat dump juliette mother possession outside in bin liner juliette write to and say it be repeat pattern of behaviour and there need to be more help out there especially for the family of these victim bank can talk to family member if they do have power of attorney but coercive controller do allow any family member to get power of attorney as they want full control there need to be change with bank otherwise there be no way of protect the victim she be absolutely right have be make aware of shocking case involve lodger gain lpa over their landlord provide that individual with access to thousand of pound in saving and the ability to remortgage and of man who could not even sign his own name whose lpa be sign away use just his finger print the scale of the abuse be already alarming and the simplification of obtain last power of attorney be prove to be fuel the fire be sure there be more as yet unknown victim survivor my bill be focus on prevention remove the incentive for unscrupulous individual to take advantage of vulnerable old people between and some case be receive involve victim survivor and lasting power of attorney by the hourglass helpline between the same date casework interaction where power of attorney be mention total some of those case be relate to economic abuse of the risk assess safeguarding concern raise in some or in no action by the office of the public guardian family court datum show that over of donor be over year old at the point of the registration of their lpa that mean that since over million people be over when they register their lpa they be vulnerable to this type of abuse my bill call for the implementation of government regulate safeguard procedure for all bank over the way they deal with lpa and the account of donor that would include contact the donor or gp before an lpa be activate and monitor spending prior to and after the lpa be activate there must be new power for the relevant authority to hold the office of the public guardian to account on deal with potential case of abuse include oversight of freeze order that be rarely if ever use immediate freezing order should be use for those under investigation so they can not pay their own legal fee with the donor fund as have happen on many occasion the office of the public guardian need to remove its financial sustainability mission statement in favour of mission about the safeguarding of vulnerable people there should be more effort to publicise the which enable the public to find out whether someone have last power of attorney that should include the introduction of online notice after the signing of an lpa and before the registration of such an agreement care home have duty to protect new resident who lack capacity and where an attorney produce power of attorney care home or other provider should have an obligation to update the register with the office of the public guardian finally be grateful to andrew bishop of rothley law for the help he have give in this campaign as well as the four courageous people whose case have mention the abuse have describe be clearly widespread case from up and down the country be become more evident every day believe it be time we act to prevent such appalling injustice and commend this bill to the house question put and agree to order that fabian hamilton bambos charalambous mr mark sewards paula barker layla moran tim roca chris law alex sobel yuan yang and andrew george present

focus bill it deliver on the government manifesto commitment to bring about an immediate reform by remove the right of the remain hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords this bill be matter of principle in the century it can not be right for there to be place in our legislature reserve for those bear into certain family have now see all the amendment table by party from across the house it be clear that there be no principled objection to the aim of the bill which be to remove the right of people to sit and make law in our legislature by virtue of an accident of birth therefore hope that all member across the house can join government members in vote for this important and long overdue legislation look forward to hear from hon member over the course of today debate but shall start with the detail of the bill itself clause be clear straightforward and central to the overall purpose of the bill it remove membership of the house of lords from the remain hereditary peer specifically clause repeal section of the house of lords act which currently provide an exception to the general exclusion of hereditary peer from membership of the house in section of the act under that exception hereditary peer and those hereditary peer hold the office of earl marshal or perform the office of lord great chamberlain continue to be member of the other place the clause be core part of the bill and deliver the government clear manifesto commitment to remove the right of the remain hereditary peer to sit and vote in the other place it will result in the removal of the reserved place for hereditary peer there be currently vacancy in the seat reserve for hereditary peer at present there be hereditary peer in the other place such vacancy would usually be fill by hereditary peer by election but such by election have be pause until january by change to the standing orders agree by the other place in july the government value the good work do by hereditary peer and we have speak on several occasion about the individual who have serve in parliament with duty and dedication these reform be not personal but they be long overdue and essential the government would find considerable sympathy for their position if they be to make provision for those hereditary peer currently in the house of lords who have do good work and who have acquire lot of experience by possibly introduce phase out or generous allocation of life peerage to those who be consider worthy on the basis of their past record of participation thank the right hon member for his intervention there would of course be no bar on the leader of the opposition nominate any of those who have serve as hereditary peer for life peerage in the normal way that sound reasonable except for the fact that unless there be phasing of the process it would not be possible within the number available to the leader of the opposition to nominate more than small fraction can the minister offer any more flexibility on that thank the right hon member for his intervention but with the great of respect it be for the leader of the opposition to nominate those whom they consider appropriate for life peerage on phase out the measure in the act be mean only to be temporary one twenty five year later we be still have these debate clause abolish the jurisdiction of the house of lords in relation to hereditary peerage claim appreciate that the subject of hereditary peerage claim may be novel one to hon member and one that be not discuss on second reading so let provide clear explanation of what hereditary peerage claim be why they be mention in the bill and why the government be propose to remove the jurisdiction of the house of lords hereditary peerage claim or peerage claim as will refer to they be when person seek to be formally recognise as the holder of the title of hereditary peerage usually the claimant of the peerage be the undisputed heir and be simply enter on the roll of the peerage follow an application to the lord chancellor however there can be some case where the claim be dispute or complex currently these case be usually refer to the other place to advise the crown on how to determine the claim the house also confirm undisputed succession of irish peerage in parallel with an application to the lord chancellor complex or dispute peerage claim occur very infrequently there have be few than claim consider by the other place in the past year give that the bill remove the final link between hereditary peerage and membership of the house of lords it be no long appropriate for these issue to be deal with by the other place that be why the bill would abolish the jurisdiction of the other place in relation to peerage claim the intention be that future complex or dispute peerage claim that would otherwise have be consider by the other place will instead be refer to the judicial committee of the privy council under section of the judicial committee act undisputed succession to irish peerage will like other type of peerage continue to be deal with by the lord chancellor as hon member know the judicial committee of the privy council which be make up of justice of the supreme court and other senior judge already have well establish constitutional role in advise the sovereign and be the appropriate body to consider these matter the government have discuss this matter with the judicial committee of the privy council which be content to take on this function therefore the government believe that follow the removal of the hereditary peer it be appropriate for the other place jurisdiction in relation to peerage claim to come to an end think that it would be helpful to briefly address amendment to this clause table by the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart the amendment make it explicit that the jurisdiction for consider peerage claim would be transfer to the judicial committee of the privy council the government position be that it be unnecessary to expressly state in the bill the transfer of the jurisdiction of peerage claim that be because as have set out matter such as peerage claim can already be refer to the judicial committee of the privy council by the crown under section of the judicial committee act therefore urge the hon member not to press his amendment turn to other part of the bill clause make consequential amendment to reflect the repeal of section of the house of lords act and more generally on the basis that there will no long be any member of the house by virtue of hereditary peerage the amendment reflect the fact that certain provision in the peerage act the house of lords act the constitutional reform and governance act and the house of lords reform act be now redundant as result of this legislation clause set out the territorial extent of the bill and when it will commence an amendment or repeal make by the bill have the same extent as the provision amend or repeal subject to that the bill extend to england and wales scotland and northern ireland there be those who believe that this reform be about make the house of lords more democratic clearly the minister can not be among they because these provision do not seem to make it any more democratic in meaningful way can she confirm therefore that she be not in favour of more democratically elect house of lords this legislation be the first step of reform of the house of lords as set out in our manifesto in our manifesto we commit to this reform immediately which be why we be discuss it today on commencement the bill will come into force at the end of the session of parliament in which it receive royal assent if the bill pass in this session hereditary peer who be member of the other place will depart at the end of the session the timing of the implementation of the bill ensure the delivery of the manifesto commitment for immediate reform in timely fashion while not undermine the business of the house with the sudden departure of number of hereditary peer in the middle of parliamentary session my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis touch on when the minister think more legislation will be come forward and the minister proudly boast about deliver on one of labour manifesto commitment when over the next two three or four year do she anticipate the other piece of legislation will be forthcoming to deliver on the rest of the manifesto we have make it clear that this be first step of reform we be committed to the other reform set out in the manifesto but it be important that there be proper consultation and that we take time to ensure that they be do in the right way that work be ongoing subject to the timely progress of the bill it will give due notice to exist hereditary peer allow for opportunity to give valedictory speech which be consistent with the approach take in the act on the future reform do the minister not accept that when house of lords reform be discuss in the hereditarie be retain as temporary measure yet the labour government never come forward with the second stage do she appreciate that many of we be slightly cynical about this government ever bring forward future stage so the solution might be to delay commencement until they bring forward proposal opposition members have year to bring about reform of the house of lords if that be what they want to do but alas they do not instead this government be take an immediate first step on the road to reform of the house of lords it be long overdue and we be get on with it clause simply establish the short title of the legislation as the house of lords hereditary peers act if the bill be pass in the short title will automatically be change to the house of lords hereditary peers act note that number of new clause have be table of course look forward to hear from the new zealous member of the cause for constitutional reform the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson as well as from the hon member for richmond park sarah olney and for perth and kinross shire pete wishart and other will not prejudge what they have to say on these matter but note again that this be focused bill that deliver on clear manifesto commitment as have say the bill be the first step in the government broad plan to reform the second chamber we recognise that other element of that agenda be more complex and it be right that we take time to consider they properly why be the government proceed with such timidity and first step when they have such large majority and could push through their will if they want to this be an immediate first step on the road to wide reform and one that be long overdue since the act it be right that we be get on with it and do so in the first session of this parliament the hon lady have try to paint the labour party as great reform party yet in when there be an opportunity to reform the house of lords systematically labour members vote against it why be she so scared to take on more bold suggestion to deliver her manifesto previous attempt to reform the other place all in one go have fail we want to see immediate reform of the other place which be why we be get on with this straightaway we can then engage and consult on how good to deliver the other reform which we have set out clearly in our manifesto alongside the bill the leader of the house of lords be engage in dialogue with the other place on take forward reform to bring about small and more active second chamber in fact as we speak she be lead debate on that very subject in the other place look forward to further discussion on this matter in the house in due course so that we get it right none of the amendment that have be table contest the objective of the bill to remove the right of people to sit and make law in our legislature by virtue of an accident of birth they should therefore not prevent we from make progress on this important and long overdue reform it be an honour to speak to the bill in committee when we last discuss it on second reading my right hon friend the member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden very great man set out why the opposition do not approve of the way in which the government be go about this change we believe that this nervous little bill be misconceive and perhaps at its bad dishonest as my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes say it be good to see that the labour party have finally reject the idea of democratically elect upper house that be always bad idea something that would impose upon the primacy of this place and after the well part of century of to ing and fro ing on the issue at last we see the labour party put that bad idea to bed however it have other bad idea and what we see here today be really an attempt to gerrymander the membership of the house of lords under the cover of reform new clause in my name would allow we to call the bill out for what it be we would like the government failure to bring forward proper plan for house of lords reform as promise in their manifesto to be record in black and white as part of the bill we would like the bill true purpose to enable for the first time all lord temporal to be appoint by the prime minister to be place on the face of the bill why do this matter well nobody sit in the house of lords now by simple right of birth before hereditary peerage generally carry with it the right to sit and vote in the house of lords but the house of lords act remove the right of most hereditary peer to membership of the house of lords as we on the conservative benches know labour have problematic relationship with history and it seem to have forget that the reason hereditary peer be leave be as firm marker for further reform the idea be that there would be no more piecemeal reform of the house of lords but that instead government would need to bring forward comprehensive plan for change the labour government be now of course assert that the continued presence of excepted hereditary peer be an accident that be not true at the time lord irvine of lairg explain that the hereditary peer remain as guarantee from the labour government that the second stage or proper reform of the house of lords would take place as he put it in compromise in these term would guarantee that stage two would take place because the government with their great popular majority and their manifesto pledge would not tolerate per cent of the hereditary peerage remain for long but the per cent will go only when stage two have take place so it be guarantee that it will take place official report house of lords march vol that lifetime guarantee appear now to have expire be bit worried about what my hon friend be say why do we need comprehensive plan at all why not just leave it alone as that great conservative lord falkland once say when it be not necessary to do something it be necessary not to do it as ever my right hon friend be one step ahead of it be not that we seek comprehensive reform of the house of lords it be that the labour party promise that this would come the government promise that they would leave the remain hereditary peer there until they have plan for comprehensive reform but that comprehensive plan be miss labour be throw out the stone in the shoe of the accept hereditary peer and dodge the hard principle question about how to ensure that the house of lords function most effectively my hon friend make pass reference to fear that what be go here be form of gerrymandering do he agree that if generous provision be to be make for really active remain hereditary member of whom there be probably quite few to be give life peerage on one off basis and on the basis of merit that would dispose of the suspicion of gerrymandering my right hon friend be absolutely right he strike at the critical failure of the legislation which be that really the government be seek to remove member of the upper house who happen not to take the labour whip what we all agree on or what hope we all agree on be that the role of the lords be that of chamber of scrutiny and we must welcome more expert scrutiny we have see from the behaviour attendance and work of hereditary peer that they be an intrinsic part of that scrutiny so it be highly suspicious that the labour party should seek to remove they indeed if we set the precedent that the government of the day can remove member of one house because they do not agree with they where will it end those cross bencher hereditary peer who will be ax by the measure have as far as can see do an excellent job yet they be not be give another way out such as that suggest by my right hon friend the hon gentleman will know that provision in the act stipulate specific number of hereditary peer by party affiliation make the lords the only place where the party of by election victor be guarantee before vote have be cast he be worried about loss of expertise in the lords as hereditary peer be expel if those peer stay do not think that they should do he acknowledge that the ringfence protect party political position ought to be remove my point be more that the government be seek to remove highly experienced people without offer another way out we would have be happy to debate that but we be instead see an attempt to deliberately cut out group of peer from the constitution will the shadow minister clarify his party position on house of lords reform we have hear two or three different view from the conservative benches remind he that if we feel that hereditary peer be do good job there be an opportunity for the leader of his party to give they life peerage it be very generous of the hon gentleman to say that the prime minister will create peer at his command have no idea that the hon gentleman career be progress at such rate we all know that that be not what be happen here we all know that in the coded word of the minister it be goodbye to the hereditary peer whose voice will not be hear any more our position be that it be time for constitutional conference to consider these matter and that the major issue be how to have an upper house that do not challenge the primacy of the commons in conduct proper scrutiny of government legislation in order to improve it be immensely grateful to my hon friend who be make speech in the spirit of his predecessor my right hon friend the member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden on why the legislation do not pass the efficacy test that set for it on second reading there be no suggestion that it will make the house of lords more effective chamber reasonable test of the legislation be whether it improve the status quo if it do not why on earth be we pursue it indeed why be we even debate it as ever wisdom from the deepings the truth be that this will not make the upper house well chamber for scrutiny all it will do be remove some of the labour party opponent from that house the labour party promise in its manifesto that the next labour government will bring about an immediate modernisation of the lords the manifesto promise that that modernisation would consist of mandatory retirement age of new participation requirement strengthening of the circumstance in which disgrace member can be remove from that house reform of the appointment process and improvement of the national and regional balance of the second chamber although we on the conservative benches might not agree with those proposal the labour party promise to introduce they immediately but the only immediate modernisation be undertake be to remove group of hard work and diligent peer include cross benchers and their convenor for the crime of not be labour party placement as be surprised that the conservatives as the so call party of aspiration be stalwartly defend the principle of hereditary peer do they not accept that in meritocracy position in the legislature should be open base on merit not inheritance the point that we be make through our amendment be that the labour party be undermine key facet of the upper house scrutiny we be talk about body of hereditary peer who have already be perform that job and have do nothing wrong but be lose that job because of the measure introduce by the bill rise will give way one more time and then will endeavour to conclude my remark thank the hon gentleman for take second intervention be he suggest that life peer declare an interest in that my partner be life peer be unable to undertake the role of scrutiny even with these modest reform which be stepping stone towards great reform my party will still be only the third large party in the house of lords while his will still be the large by some margin be he honestly say that his life peer be unable to take scrutiny seriously be delighted to hear that the hon gentleman have marry so well of course life peer do fantastic job of scrutiny they do so every day and enjoy read their lordship hansard what we be talk about be group of hereditary peer who have do very good job in scrutinise government legislation but who be be remove through no fault of their own simply because they do not fit with the labour party view we believe that that be wrong turn now to amendment in my name which concern the very simple conservative principle that constitutional change should not be rush and should certainly not be propose for political advantage we have inherit constitution that have evolve through the generation and have the distinction of work the current constitution of the other place have be effective in bring expertise and degree of independence to the work of legislative scrutiny like much of the uncodified british constitution one might not have create such system from scratch but the try and test check and balance of the house of lords have complement the work of the elect commons the lords do not claim to be democratic chamber and that be the point our house have primacy we can see the danger of ill though through constitutional change none of we in this place will forget the difficulty cause by the fixed term parliaments act foolish measure introduce by the coalition government that create all manner of unintended consequence it be rightly repeal by the conservatives in the last parliament to reinstate try and test long stand convention let that be warning to the government as they meddle in the name of petty politic with long stand convention that work walter bagehot eloquently describe the dignified and efficient element of our constitution in sense the hereditary peer represent both thank to the way in which they diligently scrutinise legislation labour must take care that pull on one thread in this case that of the hereditary peer do not unravel great deal more amendment seek to ensure that there be proper scrutiny of the change to the composition of our legislature it make the simple request that joint committee of both houses should be allow to scrutinise and report on the government so call immediate modernisation plan and that this place should agree before legislation come into force that plan would be lead by the conservative principle that constitutional change should not be rush but carefully consider and implement only if the house be confident that it will work amendment which stand in my name seek clarity on the issue of dispute peerage claim however have listen carefully to what the minister have say and understand that exist mechanism be in place for that reason we will not press it to conclude we on the conservative benches think that this bill be sham of reform it be fundamentally misconceive focus on the composition of the other place rather than on how we can ensure that it well perform its vital role of scrutiny this be government and prime minister who do not stand up to scrutiny government lead by politic not by principle my amendment seek to reinsert some principle into this process that promise to both parliament and the electorate should be keep and that we should legislate only for what work not for political advantage see no reason why the government can not accept the amendment today it be pleasure to serve under your chairmanship madam chair will keep my comment brief because know that that will entertain the committee more hon member more have not start yet give time very much enjoy the bill second reading which be why have come back for second go genuinely welcome the new reform zeal of the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson and believe there be merit to some of the amendment that bear his name be glad that the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy have say that those amendment be part of our manifesto because they be as be this bill be sure that mean that he will want the salisbury convention to be accept in the other place when the bill reach it mean that opposition members in the house of lords will make no attempt to prevent its successful passage be sure that at some point in today proceeding an opposition front bencher will be able to confirm for the record that the bill will pass smoothly once it have pass this house we have just hear the importance of the primacy of this house state eloquently by the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart this house be go to make decision on the bill today to decide whether we believe there should be role for hereditary peer in the house of lords and it will then be send to the house of lords give the importance of convention history and statute be sure that he will be able to confirm that the house of lords will happily pass it without any attempt by opposition members to amend it doubt it but hope so the point of the bill and the reason why believe it deserve support from all side of the house be that as my hon friend the minister point out this be the first step in package of house of lords reform the hon gentleman be serious individual on the government benches and respect he very much but do he not understand that give the delicate set of constitutional arrangement we have it be not unreasonable to expect the government to come forward with plan that set out several step take we on the journey that they intend to go on with some substance behind it give the number of year the government have have since the previous change over quarter of century ago it be not unreasonable to expect little more detail on those second third and fourth step or timetable thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention and to degree agree that be why we set out in our manifesto the package of reform and change that we hope to see make to the other place during this parliament in order to deliver on the promise we make in the election he be absolutely right to say that constitutional reform be delicate thing that be why it be important that we make these reform with consideration and in small step to make sure that the unintended consequence of large scale reform be not feel the conservative party make modest reform during previous parliaments such as give member of the house of lords the ability to retire from it that be small change but one with consequential impact far more member have leave the house of lords under that provision than will be impact by the provision in this bill that be do thoughtfully carefully slowly and think consensually similarly think that the principle of this bill that hereditary peer will no long have the right to sit in the house of lords have already be establish in this house none of the amendment that have be table today seek to overturn that none of they seek to make case for the continuation of hereditary peer as such the consensus that the right hon gentleman rightly talk about exist in this bill the more we seek to tack on to the bill take other element of constitutional reform and add they to the bill the more we risk that consensus fall apart we risk this house not have settle position create the opportunity for potential wrecking amendment do not suggest that opposition members be table wreck amendment but they could be table elsewhere to completely flatline what be very modest and sensible reform the hon gentleman be make very reasonable speech would it be fair to say that he mean this be almost case of go for the low hang fruit on which everybody have measure of agreement while recognise that future step may be lot more complex and potentially dangerous if we get they wrong there be one aspect that be not of itself an argument for keep the hereditary peer but be something that will be lose if and when they go that is the hereditary peer be one group of people who be not appoint subject to prime ministerial patronage without stray beyond the scope of today debate could the hon gentleman give we an inkling of whether something like put the house of lords appointments commission on statutory basis be reform that the government might consider bear in mind some of the controversial case where people have be impose on the house of lords in defiance of the commission preference could not possibly begin to offer an opinion on the thought of the government but know that my hon friend on the front bench will have hear that question he should be in it know when to move on laughter would also never dare to call the hereditary peer low hang fruit because that would be slightly disrespectful to they but understand the tenor and the tone of what the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis be say and think he be right this be about start with something on which there be broad consensus and where the impact on the other house will change our constitutional set up but not in way that will ultimately be detrimental to the important scrutiny role of the house of lords agree with the right hon member about the important role of the house of lords appointments commission and the robustness with which its advice should be treat without wish to go down the route of political point scoring there be something to be say for independent verification of an individual suitability for that place and how that ought to be respect and put on footing that would potentially mean that incident like those we have see under previous prime ministers would not recur again would love to be able to make commitment in this chamber but the only thing can commit to are those relate to my constituency and my own personal opinion the hon member speak about the need for consensus have he read new clause and table by my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson which would remove the bishop from the upper house be sure that be something on which there be great agreement on the government benches do the hon member feel able to support new clause and the hon gentleman have highlight great example of where on the face on it there may seem to be consensus but fear the immediate impact would not be as simple as he think we have an establish church in this country the church of england be an established church it be part of who we be fear that the removal of the bishop from the house of lords would open up whole series of other conversation about whether or not we still have an establish church it would potentially open up question about political and ecclesiastical overlap again think we should debate those thing we should have time to debate discuss and consider the role of the clergy and whether it be right to have bishop in the house of lords do not see why that have to be do through tack on amendment to this bill but it be something we should discuss in the future we do not usually have so much debate in staffordshire on these matter we usually have lot of consensus in staffordshire want to clarify that the amendment that seek to make to the bill would not disestablish the church of england but would remove from our constitutional arrangement an anomaly just as the bill attempt to remove an anomaly the right hon gentleman be right this be probably more staffordshire than anybody need to hear in this debate so will conclude my remark momentarily do not disagree with the necessary principle that the right hon gentleman be put forward about whether or not bishop should be entitle to seat in the house of lords by virtue of their be bishop on thursday bill be to be debate that would amend the right of woman bishop to sit in the house of lords because we have always over time gently update and amend our constitution to ensure that it reflect the society we want to be would welcome an opportunity to properly debate and consider this matter the right hon gentleman say that it be not his intention to disestablish the church of england by the removal of the bishop but there be consequence to these action which deserve more consideration and debate what be they the right hon gentleman ask what be they that be why we should have debate in the future to give we an opportunity to explore that today have have second reading debate we have the committee stage of this bill to look exclusively at the responsibility of hereditary peer and the role they play in our democracy instead of say that we need debate in future on whether such reform might risk disestablishment will the hon gentleman explain what he consider to be the legal and constitutional consequence that would risk disestablish the church think the very fact that we that we would be seek to expel the bishop who be the representative of the church of england from the national legislature would by its nature start consideration of that process interruption the hon gentleman may say that it do not but he do not know that fear that well mean amendment table by the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge would create more significant debate about the role of the church in our country although we may want to have that debate be not sure it should be trigger on the back of an amendment to short tightly draft bill about the role of hereditary peer in the house of lords if the hon member for west suffolk want to bring something forward would be more than happy to talk to he about how could support it but it should not be tack on to bill on which there be already clear consensus around the role and responsibility of hereditary peer that hope deal with the point that he raise finally on second reading we hear great deal about our manifesto and the labour party commitment to house of lords reform the reform be one of the most significant change to our constitutional settlement that there have be for very long time it be not just about the expulsion of the hereditary peer but the creation of the lord speaker and the removal of the law lords to sit in the supreme court it be package that come forward over time in series of bills to implement the commitment that we make at the election that for be the start of where we be today we will put through the bill that do the first part bank that and then move on know that there be an appetite across the house for considerable house of lords reform that have be evident from opposition speech but we need to bank what we have do and move forward hope that today we shall pass the bill through committee unamended and on to third reading so that it can make its way to the other place where because of the commitment that know the minister will give in sum up later the salisbury convention will be engage that it can pass through the house of lords quickly without change and that we can move on with the rest of the reform that we require rise to speak in support of new clause and which stand in my name and their associate consequential amendment it be pleasure to follow the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell simply because think that much of what he say support my amendment certainly some of the point he make shall be make also my liberal democrat colleague and be proud that it be our party that have for decade lead the call for reform of the house of lords with democratic mandate the bill be welcome step forward and one that we support however we do believe that broad and bolder reform of our upper chamber be need which be why have table these two new clause to extend the power of this legislation the new clause would finally see the house of lords with democratic mandate and would ensure that the house of lords appointments commission could never again be sidestep and ignore by an unscrupulous government welcome the hon lady point about strengthen the house of lords appointments commission but at the risk of broaden the debate little too far can she explain why it would be sensible idea to have second chamber of elect parliamentarian it would be rather like more than double the size of this house but with member in two separate place possibly elect by different electoral system and at different time it be impossible to imagine more of recipe for deadlock and conflict very much look forward to have that debate in future session of this parliament and on future piece of legislation that be why table new clause to call on the government to make commitment to future legislation so that we in this house can debate and support broad and further reform to ensure the democratic legitimacy of the house of lords do the hon lady recall that in fact we have have that debate we have it last in proper sense in on jack straw proposal when on the basis of the consensus that we be try to establish here consensus there be none and the thing descend into complete chaos would she remember that when make her proposal if she think there will be consensus on this extremely difficult issue of an elect house of lords be afraid she be in cloud cuckoo land well how polite of the right hon gentleman to say so obviously do not personally recall what happen in what we be try to establish today be the step that can be take to reform the house of lords we very much support the step that we be debate today that first step upon which as the minister say in her opening remark there be broad consensus we want to see broad reform of the house of lords and we want the government to bring forward further proposal in due course new clause be about push they to produce those further proposal in timely fashion so that we can hold that debate in this parliament and progress the cause of measure on which we can find consensus across the house give that the hon lady amendment be not likely to be pass assume that on the ground of logic and consistency she will vote against third reading of the unamended bill as say early and she implicitly concede as it stand the bill do not make the house of lords one ounce one iota one fraction more democratic thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention we intend to support the bill because we want to see the abolition of the hereditary peer that be very much part of what the liberal democrats want however we want to see more we want to go far we want to see broad reform have to say to the right hon gentleman that have hear not only an appetite from all side to support the bill as the minister say there be broad consensus across the house for that but great zeal on the tory benches for further reform therefore do not understand why there would not be broad support for my new clause which call on the government to enshrine in this bill commitment to go far because that be clearly what so many tory members be say they would like to see with so much trust in politic have be destroy by the chaos of the previous conservative government we must take this opportunity to underscore the integrity of parliament with transparency and democratic authority in our second chamber we be grateful to the government for introduce this legislation so early in the parliament fundamentally the liberal democrats do not believe that there be space in modern democracy for hereditary privilege new clause would impose duty on ministers to take forward proposal to secure democratic mandate for the house of lords through introduction of directly elect member around the world trust in the institution and lever of the democratic process have too often fray over recent year in our democracy we must ensure that the vital link between the people and their institution remain strong democratic mandate be central to that mission reform of our upper chamber have be long stand liberal democrat policy we must do all we can to restore public trust in politic after the chaos of the previous conservative government by introduce democratic mandate for members of the house of lords we can ensure that trust in politic be strengthen the disregard with which the previous conservative government treat the public trust threaten to erode faith in our democracy the bill be an opportunity to underline our commitment to democratic value and to begin to rebuild that trust the new clause would strengthen the democratic mandate of the second chamber and liberal democrats call on the government to support it as well our call for wide reform to modernise our electoral system we want to strengthen democratic right and participation by scrap the conservative party voter id scheme be sure that there be lot on which member of all party can agree as the hon lady note table new clause that would remove the bishop will the liberal democrats support that it be policy that liberal democrats traditionally support will they support it today if it come to vote be happy to say that we support that ambition long term however do not believe that the bill be the correct vehicle for it as the minister say in her opening remark there be currently widespread consensus on the bill and tack on new clause which the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson table would threaten its passage in the other place want the bill to be pass as quickly as possible so we will not support that new clause today we want to take big money out of politic by cap donation to political party we also want this new labour government to be bold in transfer more power from westminster and whitehall we believe that local authority know well what their community and town need and we want the government to acknowledge that by boost their authority and power we continue to support the finding of the burns report in which recommend cut the house of lords to peer and outline way in which to ensure that that happen although the removal of hereditary members be an important step in that process we will continue to push the government to make further reform in future in particular we look to they to uphold their manifesto commitment to introduce retirement age measure which would far aid the reduction and subsequent management of the size and membership of the upper house we want the second chamber to have proper democratic legitimacy ultimately we want to move towards replace the house of lords with an elect chamber we believe that move to fully democratic elect chamber be essential to strengthen the integrity of parliament and the authority of our second chamber new clause would enshrine democratic mandate for our second chamber in the bill thus strengthen the integrity of our parliament new clause would prevent life peerage from be confer on person if the house of lords appointments commission recommend against the appointment we have consistently speak out against the current system of prime ministerial appointment which ingrain patronage reinforce the elitism of british politic and contribute to so many people lose faith in our system we would like the government to reassure we that they will not follow in the footstep of the previous conservative government who allow the other house to balloon in size and that they will do everything possible to prevent culture of sleaze and cronyism from develop in their administration as we see under the previous conservative government as former prime minister boris johnson prove by become the first prime minister to ignore the advice of holac make deeply inappropriate appointment to the other house it be far too easy for culture of sleaze to develop in the heart of government it be essential that we strengthen and improve public confidence in politic hope the minister agree that accept this amendment would strengthen the integrity of any government and prevent the kind of behaviour have describe from return to westminster the new clause would ensure that recommendation make by the house of lords appointments commission could no long be bypass by the prime minister improve the integrity and democratic power of our second chamber be glad that the government have indicate that the bill be first step in reform the other place and that in their manifesto they commit to reform such as change to the appointment process be grateful to the minister for the cabinet office for his recent commitment to consider improve the mechanism for review appointment to the other house and implement safeguard to protect against cronyism if the minister and the prime minister be sufficiently convince that they will never override holac which they should be do they agree that enshrine that principle in law be good thing new clause would strengthen the power of holac and urge the minister to support it to remove the perception that the house of lords will now be more subject to patronage also ask he to set out timeline for introduce broad reform which would bring the appointment of peer more in line with those of other honour such as knighthood which require an overview of the relevant skill knowledge and experience of the candidate we be clearly live in new era of politic political engagement be at an historic low voter participation in our recent general election be the low since with few than of eligible voter cast their ballot it be vital that we do all we can to restore public trust in government it be also important that parliament represent and reflect the diversity and richness of the people and culture that make up our country currently not single hereditary peer be woman the privilege of hereditary peer membership exacerbate the distinct gender imbalance of the second chamber the bill which remove the last remain hereditary peer membership of the other place be significant step in move towards more representative parliament hope we can all agree on the inappropriateness of hereditary status as qualification for membership of second chamber in modern parliamentary democracy and that be the son grandson or great grandson of former courtier colonial administrator or century businessman be neither reason nor justification for seat in democratic parliament my liberal democrat colleague and welcome the bill and we be grateful to the government because in the legislation and subsequently we hope to see the most significant modernisation of the upper chamber in quarter of century be proud elect member of this house like everyone in this place be send here by my constituent to fulfil the great honour of my life for as long as the people of leeds south west and morley give permission to do so have hear opposition front benchers say today that the bill be base not on principle but on political advantage serve in westminster should never be an inalienable birthright we can all get behind that basic principle the very concept of hereditary peer remain indefensible in the century we be one of only two nation that currently have they there should not be seat in the other place reserve for people bear into the right family it be time to end that this bill not only set out our ambition to remove this archaic right but show our determination to make our democracy strong and more representative it be just the start of our commitment to reform the other place and improve its ability to do what we be all send here to do serve the public it be right that after the immediate start on hereditary peer the government will take time to consider how good to implement further reform with the public and peer heavily involve in those discussion give the enthusiasm among conservative members for the change that may be come look forward to their lead the charge with we to reform the other place that say there have be some confusion on the conservative benches about the opposition position on the bill on second reading enjoy the suggestion that we be go too far as well as the suggestion that we be not go far enough conservative members appear to want more debate on the broad change that we suggest for the other place but they spend their time in government block such change for more than decade zero progress be make rise rise will happily give way to whichever member be more enthusiastic be grateful to the hon gentleman and to my right hon friend the hon gentleman have present an argument that be base on the principle that hereditary peerage be wrong will he give we clear principle argument in favour of life peerage why do he believe that that be acceptable when those peer can legislate for lifetime for decade with no accountability at all emphasise that hereditary peer be in the house of lords because they be bear into particular family that can not be right life peer be there because they be appoint usually because of expertise that they can offer in scrutinise legislation therefore suggest that life peer definitely have the advantage over hereditary peer simply because they be not there through the family they be bear into thank the hon gentleman for his generosity in give way he make persuasive and strong argument what right do he think the bishop of winchester have to vote on matter relate to his constituent in leeds south west and morley or to mine in stone great wyrley and penkridge what give that bishop the right to be legislator what be the argument have read the right hon gentleman amendment and understand his argument but the change that we be propose today be quite simply down payment on the broad change we will be bring to the other place and when we bring those other change forward look forward to march side by side with he through the aye lobby gently suggest that many of the problem in our country today have be make significantly bad because the conservative party have often prioritise keep its faction happy ahead of any coherent policy making for our country we have see microcosm of that today and we see it on second reading it appear from most of the amendment submit in committee that the conservatives do not have problem with the substance of the change that we be offer so look forward to see many of they march through the aye lobby with we the other place play an incredibly important role in our democracy its member both scrutinise and improve legislation pass in this place which have be very welcome depend on who we ask over many year but the change we be consider today be very simple and be necessary to fulfil the promise we make at the general election that we would end the outdated practice of hereditary peer may not look it but be old enough to remember the last labour government they start the process of reform the other place and it be clear then as it be now that it be transitional compromise it may have take while but it fall on this government to see through the work they start this be an incredibly simple and effective change to the other place and urge all member of this house to support it appreciate have have the opportunity to table number of amendment to the bill very much in the hope of improve it and ensure that we get it into the good possible place to deliver change change that will ensure that the law go through parliament be scrutinise well and more democratically appreciate that in politic there be certain amount of robustness certain amount of argument certain amount of the punch and judy politic at which we all despair we should be look to do more and to do well there be number of thing that the labour party set out in its manifesto that think command broad public support and there be number of thing that it do not spell out in its manifesto that it be implement and that most certainly do not command support what do command broad public support be some of the change labour set out for the house of lords that be why have table new clause and firmly believe that there be strong support for the introduction of minimum contribution requirement in the house of lords do the right hon gentleman accept that new clause do not take into account illness or maternity and paternity leave and that perhaps eight week be little too brief new clause clearly set out an intention to deliver on what labour manifesto wish to introduce and would be happy to work with government ministers and the liberal democrats spokesman to ensure that we get this legislation into the good possible shape some of the attendance record in the upper house leave little shocked in the parliament of the members eligible to attend at least some of the last parliament do not attend at all do not even bother to turn up and attend on less than of the sit day which be not particularly active quite understand why labour front benchers when in opposition alight on that and feel that it need to be include in their manifesto that be why table new clause firmly believe that there be support for it not only on the labour benches labour members stand on their manifesto so presumably they support that proposal but on the opposition benches during that same period member of the upper house vote in less than of the divisions they be eligible to vote in hate to strike discordant note with my right hon friend as he and have fight shoulder to shoulder in many battle but be it not an illustration of the pandora box one might be open to consider what the situation would be if all these people turn up at the same time doubt very much that the upper chamber would be capable of handle it which then lead we to the question of how to reduce the number to manageable proportion so my right hon friend be get into difficult water with all of this he have well be careful what he wish for in get all these people to converge on the house of lords at once my right hon friend and agree on so many thing but perhaps be just want to see this change happen by add new clause introduce labour manifesto commitment as part of this bill we can significantly reduce the size of the upper house and avoid the kind of intimate crush that he set out do not wish to pause the right hon gentleman while he be in the middle of his intimate crush but as someone who be always fan of clause iv understand what he be try to achieve with this new clause however would put to he one point under new clause participation in division would in itself not be the only thing require member could simply turn up be see and take their seat and they would not have to take part in division or contribute so his new clause would not achieve what he be seek he will undoubtedly bring this measure back in future bill so will he consider retrospective application one of my worry be that number of member of the other house have not turn up for many week or month and in fact there be some who over the last two and half year have an attendance rate of less than so would it not be wrong for they simply to turn up now get their tick and then wait eight week if we be to say let retrospectively apply this from today the right hon gentleman would have huge clear out of those who have not make any contribution so far and give that they have not turn up so far they would not be miss much be get excited that the hon member be discover little radicalism because always feel be in his heart but perhaps the eye of the whip have squeeze it out of he of late the hon gentleman make very thoughtful and interesting point and would very much like to work on cross party basis to get the legislation into the good possible shape on minimum contribution number of peer in the upper house have continuously fail to make significant contribution there be route for they to be able to exit out of the upper house but they have choose not to do so that cause real problem and real challenge for the upper house and new clause would offer way to tackle they think will agree with what my right hon friend will come on to suggest but be we be little unfair on their lordship since clearly lot of they do not get the memo that say you have be appoint to this high honour and you will turn up and do some meaningful work some of they think they be simply at the apex of the uk honour system be not the fundamental issue that we have fail to separate the honours system and do piece of work in our parliament my right hon friend be spot on there have sometimes be that confusion and new clause or anything that the government would look to bring forward as back up by their manifesto and popular support for such move would mean that we could get the upper house work much well the introduction of mandatory retirement age be another thoughtful and dare say it far reach policy that be in labour manifesto pay tribute to the paymaster general we all know he be one of the fine author in this house and his publication be still available on amazon although they be not quite as seek after as those of the former right hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip be sure that the volume on the prime minister that will no doubt be come forward will be real hot seller but the paymaster general be great author and he come up with the mandatory retirement age imagine and it be good policy it be certainly worth include in this legislation that he be bring forward it be not onerous in add too much to the bill and it would have significant impact in reduce the size of the house of lords we know that the house of lords be the large legislative chamber outside of the people republic of china the simple act of introduce mandatory retirement age which be key part of the labour party manifesto would considerably reduce the number of life peer it would also have significant impact on reduce the cost of the house of lords be sorry to declare an interest but why be my right hon friend so ageist some people be wonderful at the age of and other be useless at the age my right hon friend make powerful point we have to respect the fact that labour achieve majority at the last general election it have manifesto to enact change think that be the phrase hon member hear hear this be an opportunity to do it but the government seem frightened would hate to make the suggestion that deal be do with previous member of this house who be mean to be send up to the other house and that the government would not introduce this change because it would lead to those people automatic exclusion or suchlike certainly would not want to imply that but we need to see this change new clause would enable the government to deliver on their manifesto commitment and that be important because there have sometimes be talk about the breakdown in trust in politic there have sometimes be talk that we need to build confidence in politic the good way of build confidence in politic be to set out our manifesto and one party win one party lose and then the winner deliver on that manifesto this be great opportunity to do that appreciate that both the paymaster general and his hon friend the member for lewisham west and east dulwich ellie reeves have set out to members that future legislation be come personally think that be slightly optimistic view and have sit on parliamentary business and legislation committees in the past so understand the pressure on the legislative timetable if the paymaster general be under the illusion that he will be get wave of new bills go forward he will end up at the end of his ministerial career slightly disappointed because that eventuality simply will not happen finally will turn to new clause and which accept be not in the labour manifesto it be great to hear the right hon gentleman speak of the labour party manifesto at the last election and about how important it be that we can get through our programme for government have be elect with such resounding win do his support extend to other area in our manifesto such as the employment rights bill will he also support that there be many area of the labour party manifesto that would agree with and there be many that disagree with but the hon lady be in the fortunate position of have great deal more power than any member on the opposition benches she can bring influence to bear on those on her front bench and urge she to do so there be an ability within this bill to deliver on number of the commitment that she make to her electorate and that the prime minister make to elector across the country encourage the hon lady to use her position of influence and power to encourage government front benchers to deliver what she be elect to deliver there will always be area of agreement on both side of the house and there will occasionally be area of discord where can not always agree with my front bench team but there be an opportunity to deliver what the labour party promise thank the right hon gentleman for be so generous and gracious with his time he rightly point out that his new clause and be not labour party manifesto commitment so he will understand why they could cause the bill to become unstuck when the salisbury convention be apply at the other end as the minister will confirm later have he use his position of power and influence to confirm that conservative members in the upper house with their plurality and majority in most vote will support new clause and so that the bill can still make its passage and deliver the one thing on which we have consensus the hon gentleman flatter by suggest that have any power once as chief whip could have have gentle nudge on the tiller to make thing happen but sadly the only army can now bring to bear be will happily do what can on these important new clause and will walk side by side with the paymaster general through the lobby to deliver for his party on its manifesto commitment but be afraid that be the only commitment can make because would not wish to over promise thank the right hon gentleman for give way in his entertaining speech he make several reference to our manifesto but would like to make some reference to the conservative party manifesto order hope the hon member intervention be on the house of lords and within the scope of the bill it be relate to reference to reform of the house of lords there be no reference to reform of the house of lords in the conservative party manifesto there be one reference to peer but not to peer in the other place and there be few reference to the constitution but not to our unwritten constitution will the right hon gentleman tell the house why he be now so fascinated by these measure thank the hon gentleman for make point and hope that his whip have note the support that he be try to offer bring his attention to when there be an attempt at major body of reform of the house of lords that be something that be go to vote for want to see that reform in as wish to see that reform in this may shock he and start to undermine his faith that he join party with radical tradition or wish to deliver reform or change it be the labour party his party that vote that attempt down and make sure that it could not proceed the right hon member mention the bill will he enlighten we as to how his party vote on that be more than happy to do so more conservative members vote in favour of that legislation and it collapse not through lack of support on conservative benches or liberal democrat benches but because her majesty official opposition at that time be go to vote against it which mean that the number be not go to stack up the decision by the labour party and its leadership to collapse that piece of legislation mean that significant body of reform do not happen turn to the labour party manifesto perhaps the hon member for bolton west phil brickell have have glance at this but possibly not it say on page that labour would introduce legislation to remove the right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords labour will also introduce mandatory retirement age at the end of the parliament in which member reach year of age they will be require to retire from the house of lords the subsequent paragraph say labour will ensure all peer meet the high standard the public expect of they and will introduce new participation requirement as well as strengthen the circumstance in which disgrace member can be remove those be perfectly sound point of policy which the party stand on at the last general election but now it choose to ignore they rise appreciate that labour member wish to earn brownie point and will let another earn his brownie point and edge that little bit close to the allure of junior parliamentary private secretaryship will the right hon member remind how long parliamentary term be and therefore how long we have to implement our manifesto order remind member that they should be in for the duration of the debate or make an effort to be in for considerable duration before make intervention thank you for your firm chairmanship of this debate madam chairman the hon member make strong and powerful intervention which hope be note down can see he be the parliamentary private secretary for the junior minister in the department for environment food and rural affairs very soon be not sure if my commendation and support help he in his endeavour but hope that it do of course the hon member make thoughtful and interesting point the government do have time to introduce further legislation but the reality be that pressure on time in this place be one of the great pressure time be the most precious thing certainly would not engage in any form of political betting hope that can be record in hansard but if perhaps in previous age be bet man might have offer this wager to the paymaster general would wager whole that the paymaster general will not be in situation of get any more legislation on lords reform will give way to the paymaster general who be go to refute that certainly would not enter into wager would have hop that the conservative party would have learn its lesson on that have hop that the paymaster general would have give categorical assurance that there would be further legislation and that in the next king speech retirement age in the house of lords will be introduce as part of that legislation along with minimum participation level but he stay silent he make little quip will give he another opportunity to do so although he will probably stay in his place which be of course his right do not know where the naive assumption or belief on the labour benches that there will be furth lords reform come from there will not be any more be here during the when labour attempt to bring in lords reform and give up immediately with no intention of ever bring that back this be it this be all we be go to get and unless we make this good bill this be all we will get in this parliament thank the hon gentleman for make an incredibly powerful point he be absolutely right he be veteran of these argument and know how it will go because we have see it before this be the moment there be not go to be another one this be it turn to new clause and which be the most important of the one that have table it be fundamentally unfair that we still have situation where bloc of cleric have right and say over our legislation over how my constituent live can not see how in today world that can be justify we have not see argument come forward as to why these bishop should be defend rise will give way in moment as an anglican can not see why have right to great representation than my child who be catholics be often tell the bishop have be there since the reformation well lot of thing be happen around the reformation that be not that keen to see happen today appreciate that the paymaster general may have different view on that and may want to revive some of those age old tradition but do not this be an opportunity not to jeopardise the bill but to improve it recognise that the proposal be not in the labour party manifesto but ask members across the house to consider whether in all conscience they should vote for this anomaly to continue to exist from my perspective this be an issue of conscience and of what we think and feel be right those bishop do not come from every component part of the united kingdom they do not come from wales northern ireland and scotland but only from england the composition of those bishop be probably not reflective of today world feel it be fundamentally wrong that because of the statute of the archbishop of canterbury the archbishop of york the bishop of london the bishop of durham and the bishop of winchester have right to legislate on my constituent believe that they have an absolute right to influence the course of public debate but from the pulpit not in parliament my right hon friend allow on that basis to give he short lecture on the character of conservatism he need to understand that the collective wisdom of age vest in great institution like the monarchy which by the way be hereditary the church this parliament and the small institution that burke call the little platoon transmit in age old form be always more important than the fad and fashion of any one generation at any point in time if he understand that he would understand why he be conservative always have feel that my right hon friend be all the collective historical accumulate wisdom that we could ever possibly want have always believe that the great strength of conservatism can be the ability to reform and to have radical approach to change our country and the world in the shape that we wish it to be be very much warming to what my right hon friend have to say he rightly speak of the reformation but will he recall that broadly speak there be two reformation in this country there be the english reformation and the scottish reformation we never have any discussion about the place of the other establish church the scottish church in our constitutional arrangement that seem to be quirk of history be not for one moment suggest that moderator of the church of scotland should sit in the other place but it underscore and highlight the issue that my right hon friend have raise about the position of the english bishop my right hon friend be absolutely correct the position of the lords spiritual throw up more question than it answer and that be why deeply urge those on the treasury bench to look at my amendment and to ask whether they can make their legislation well can they be the government that think they wish to be in order to deliver that change certainly share much of the right hon gentleman zeal on the removal of the bishops from the lords do he share my concern about the privileged speaking and seat position that they have in the lords do and if we have the opportunity to divide on my amendment be look forward to the hon gentleman join in the lobby we can sort that problem out with this piece of legislation by vote to get rid of they and therefore there will be no privileged seating arrangement and little bit more space for the wife of the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell the husband of the hon member for lewisham west and east dulwich ellie reeves and all other peer on the government benches as that be where think they sit can go through all the argument on the presence of bishops in parliament only one other sovereign country have cleric in its parliamentary body which be iran do not think that be necessarily the good model for we to base ourselves on this piece of legislation give we the opportunity to have more reflective parliamentary body across europe many country have strong faith where religion play an incredibly important part in national debate and national discourse but none of those country whether france germany italy spain or portugal feel the need to have that assure clerical block of bishops in their legislature less than of the british population attend anglican service on sunday by take this action to remove the bishop we recognise that britain be changed country britain be very different today from how it be in if we look forward to when lords reform legislation next come forward probably in another year britain will be change again let we use this opportunity to ensure the upper house be more reflective of our nation the reality be that the lords spiritual do not take part in many if the labour party introduce participation requirement it would probably mean the exclusion of number of bishop datum have show that the support for have bishop in the house of lords be incredibly low indeed even in the anglican church support for have bishop in the house of lords be incredibly low some of priest back reform to the bishop bench go back to the legislation there be proposal to shrink the bishop bench from its current to yet the labour party have shy away from all attempt to do even the most modest reform there be no credible example of where it be reasonable to have bishop legislate on our constituent the only argument from the labour party seem to be that this be simple bill well this be simple amendment it be not right that so many of our constituent who do not have an anglican faith be legislate on by anglican bishop we have to make these change and we have to seize the opportunity because this will be the last and only opportunity to make they while this government be in power it be pleasure to serve under your chairmanship madam chair would like to speak in support of the bill which believe be long overdue thank the minister for her contribution and welcome in particular her warm word on the importance of the bill as clear manifesto commitment to reform how the other place function as an immediate modernisation since the groundbreaking house of lords act be pass by labour government there have be no substantive reform to the hereditarie in the other place despite an obvious public appetite to do so indeed study conduct by university college london constitution unit find that only of respondent support the current system before have the enormous privilege of represent the people of bolton west spend over decade tackle bribery and corruption time and again have see how trust be develop only when those responsible for decision making be truly hold accountable will focus on the word accountability which be gravely lack with the remain hereditarie over the course of my working career it have become clear that the uk have an important role to play on the global stage as world leader on political integrity but this country reputation as well govern and frankly clean jurisdiction have be degrade over recent year country that previously welcome our counsel with open arm now look on it with scorn that be why this long overdue reform matter to and why passionately support the government on the bill be sure there be some hereditary peer who undertake hard work and have no doubt that many have genuine commitment to public service but the concept of hereditary peerage hereditary privilege and be able to legislate for life merely by dint of birth belong in the same breath as second job lobbying scandal and the revolve door it be an anachronism that need to go contrary to the protestation from conservative members the bill be not about spite rather it be about improve trust and accountability in our politic the public expect high standard from our legislature but the simple fact be that too many hereditary peer do not play proper role in our democracy we make that point in the labour manifesto early this year which opposition members will no doubt note result in resounding mandate across the country to deliver change the fact do not bear out what the hon gentleman have say if he look at the record he will see that hereditary peer tend proportionally to speak more often in debate they tend to be more involved in table amendment and more of they tend to be whip they be more active in proportional term than the appointee who also by the way lack democratic legitimacy thank the right hon member for his contribution but he will note that do not mention activity or participation in the other house mention democracy and democratic accountability which hereditary peer do not have neither do life peer we will come on to life peer shortly this be an important change that be in our manifesto as you will recognise madam chair it be important because we need equality of representation which be vital if we be to retain confidence in the way in which both this house and the other place operate it be year since woman be allow to sit in the other place but there be currently no woman among the hereditary peer there and for one am embarrassed by that it be disgrace as member from the north west should add that it have not escape my attention or that of my constituent that individual from my part of this great nation be under represent in the other place especially again among the hereditary peer accord to the electoral reform society of hereditary peer live in london and the south east do not accept that hereditary peer who be the son of duke an earl viscount or marquess be any well prepared to scrutinise legislation than the daughter of plumber or the son of nurse the hon gentleman be make an incredibly powerful speech and one of great merit do he believe it be right for english bishop and only english bishop to be able to vote on scottish affair and rule the roost over scotland wales and northern ireland think that that point be very much akin to his own argument admire the right hon member penchant for house of lords reform but will come to these point later if may the consequence of not act be no less than existential when it come to trust in our politic in this place and in the other house trust in politic be at an all time low which be legacy of year of cronyism and corruption from the party opposite indeed polling conduct by the uk anti corruption coalition early this think that if the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy listen to what have to say he will reflect on it two third of respondent two third feel the uk be get more corrupt and in only of respondent tell the office for national statistics that they trust political party it all add up turnout in july be the second low in uk election since at time when autocratic hostile state seek to undermine we at every turn democratic engagement have rarely be so important believe that that this bill be small but important step towards restore that trust as my right hon friend the prime minister promise we would do during the election campaign the committee will also note what very much hope be the impending appointment of an ethic and integrity commissioner an anti corruption champion and covid corruption commissioner those be all vital measure alongside the bill to improve standard and increase accountability urge the government to confirm those appointment as soon as possible they be further step towards show the country that it be vital to regain trust in politic as means of improve life for all the point about trust in politic be valid and the hon member statistic show deterioration in that trust over the last couple of decade be probably something for all of we in this chamber to reflect on notably the politician who be new to the house be not sure how hereditary peer who have be serve for decade since the time when trust in politic be far high be to blame for the modern lack of trust that be more for those in this house to consider especially new member rather than people who have give lifelong and diligent service in the other place thank the hon member for his contribution hereditary peer be there by dint of birth not by dint of their service or contribution to public life he talk about decade of service which may accrue over period of time but that be merely by dint of birth we will shortly come to appointment to the other place which touch on the point about accountability and trust want to talk about the various amendment table by the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson as colleague have say it be great shame that he do not discover that he have such penchant for reform and modernisation during his year as member of the govern party point out to the hon gentleman that vote for house of lords reform in hope that he will take the opportunity to withdraw his comment give that in his own front benchers vote against reform or indicate that they would do so unless be mistaken the previous debate on this bill be the first time that the right hon member mention house of lords reform in this place the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart and the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge have correctly note that our manifesto include many of the amendment that the conservative party be attempt to push through today look forward to work with our front benchers on further modernise commitment that be enshrine in our manifesto which can assure conservative member have read those commitment include change to the appointment process to improve the national and regional balance of the second chamber mandatory retirement age long term commitment to replace the house of lords with an alternative second chamber that be more representative of the region and nation and participation requirement however be sure that conservative members agree that anything as knotty unwieldy and fundamental as constitutional reform will inevitably have to be incremental do too much too soon may cause damage note that the conservative party take that logic to its extreme over the last year by bring forward no substantive reform whatsoever there be no mention of lords modernisation in the conservative party manifesto as my hon friend the member for rugby john slinger mention the meagre change make under previous conservative administrations comprise nothing more than tinker around the edge at time when the other place need to be urgently drag into the century will not support the amendment if member present be genuinely commit to modernise how our democracy work look forward to constructive engagement with the government and the opposition throughout the course of this parliament commend the action take so far by the government and will support further measure over time to modernise how the other place work mature democracy such as ours centre around the mother of parliaments no less simply can not continue with an unelected hereditary upper house we hear early from the hon member for brentwood and ongar who talk about in his word gerrymandering let we talk about gerrymandering let recall one statistic that be worth remind the house about for every one and half day that former conservative prime minister liz truss be in power she create life peer total of during the course of her day premiership much like the hereditary peer those new legislator will have seat in the house of lords for life how can that be right indeed it be clear to that the house of lords appointments commission do not present particularly high bar for appointment once the immediate first step be complete number of ambitious step must be take to deliver genuine last reform of the way we do politic in this country in summary this bill will help to wrench our political system kick and scream into the century the conservatives include the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sit on their hand for the last year we have be in government for four month and we be already deliver look forward to vote for the bill tonight rise to speak in support of new clause to which stand in my name and all the associate amendment but will also support any amendment that would reduce the size of the house of lords and limit its authority in our legislature as long as it remain wholly democratic institution be quite simple soul be just someone who intrinsically believe that if you represent the people you should be vote for by the people believe that if you be to legislate it require consent through some sort of electoral mandate from group of people who vote for you to go into legislature to represent they and who allow you to make the law of the land that be simple belief and think it be generally support by the majority of the british people certainly the late opinion poll on the house of lords show that only about one in seven people in the uk think that the house of lords in its current condition be worth support vast majority want fully elect house of lords and that be what labour promise that be what they say they would deliver that be what they commission gordon brown to do and he come back with report that say he would do it and of course it have not happen be touch by labour members naive faith that there will be more than this bill it be quite touching that they actually believe that succession of piece of legislation be go to come through that will incrementally deal with all the issue of the house of lords be sorry to break to it to they but that be not go to happen the hon gentleman party have long talk about constitutional change in this country but it be our party that deliver devolution in scotland wales and northern ireland as well as mayor for london and the london assembly his party have only talk about it be that not the reality of our party deliver on constitutional change yes of course we be delighted that we have the scottish parliament congratulate and thank the labour government for deliver that and they be right but they have never deliver anything when it come to the house of lords except the reform of that be the only thing that they have bring forward other than this pathetic minuscule bill that do something that should have be do century ago we be suppose to congratulate they and thank they for get rid of the most ridiculous class of parliamentarian anywhere in the world the hereditary peer of england scotland wales and northern ireland it be absurd well do for finally get rid of the baron the duke the earl and all the other assorted aristocrat that should have be do century ago the commitment that be wait for from labour be the commitment that it give over century ago do labour members know what that be they do not know what it be so will tell they labour party commitment from over year ago can not remember the exact year say that it would abolish the house of lords that be historic commitment by the labour party that it have not even come close to realise but it be now thank you labour rid of the earl the duke the baron and the grace so suppose we have to be thankful for that would be interested to hear the hon gentleman assessment of how that radical reform from year ago be go appreciate that he may not have study the labour manifesto many labour members have not do so either but it state that labour aim to make second chamber that be more representative of the region and nation wonder whether he could share his thought on how that be go and whether he think that mrs gray will be able to contribute to that in significant manner let just say that the progress have not be all that be anticipate or all that we hop for we could say that progress have be practically non existent we also have the crush news today that our british envoy to scotland will no long be go there to represent this parliament as part of her duty in the nation and region can tell the house that the nation of scotland be almost inconsolable about the fact that our envoy will no long be go to scotland we be plan the street party and practise the haka just to make sure that she would be properly welcome to our northern territory but she be no long go to be there although the hon gentleman want to get rid of the hereditarie his party seem to want to create hereditary system by allow the right hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn to stand for the scottish parliament gently break it to the hon gentleman that no snp member will ever end up in an undemocratic outrage like that place down the corridor do not know how many scottish labour members will be in parliament for or year but about of the last generation of scottish labour members be now in the house of lords this conveyor belt that reward distinguished career in the house of commons with place in the house of lords be one of the thing want to address with my amendment have hop to table an amendment to try to realise labour historical ambition to abolish the house of lords thank to the good work of the clerks know that be highly unlikely to secure such an amendment and that be probably right so think would be creative and try to abolish its membership therefore draft series of amendment to try to get rid of all the distinct group and class of member of the house of lords again think would be singularly unsuccessful in that mission and endeavour but have three amendment on the amendment paper those amendment be cracker believe but look forward to speak about they they would abolish the prime ministerial donor appointee and crony who fill the other place and they would abolish the idea that former member of parliament can assume they will get place in the house of lords be really pleased with myself it be pity to interrupt the hon gentleman when he be in such state of excitement about his work but it be difficult to take lecture from he on delivery when this labour government have deliver so much in just few short day he may want to talk to his colleague in the scottish government about their delivery on for example the state of the health service in scotland what be the hon gentleman stance on the multiple occasion in recent year when senior figure in his party have approach friendly peer to table amendment to legislation on their behalf it seem that those senior figure be quite happy to use the other place when it suit they there be point of principle behind our position on the house of lords and it be simple word democracy we refuse to have anybody in the house of lords because we believe that people should have an electoral mandate democratic backing from the people of this country to serve in the legislature that be something on which the hon lady and will never agree believe she be quite happy and satisfied that unelected peer continue to inhabit the other place my party be hopeful that the house of lords might sometimes challenge government and perhaps make they think again but it always back down any attempt to get the house of lords to agree to any sort of principle be waste of time the hon gentleman be clearly very pleased with himself and his amendment the only seat as secure as seat in the house of lords be seat at the top of regional list for proportional representation he have table well mean amendment to prohibit any member who have serve in this parliament or the last from seek seat in the house of lords would he apply that to his own party so that any member who have serve in this parliament or the last be not eligible to seek nomination or election to the scottish parliament say to the hon gentleman ever so gently that he should leave bypass devolution to his friend from scottish labour because they be just little bit well at it than he it be their job to constantly speak about the scottish parliament and the scottish government to be fair to they they have do fantastic job they barely even mention the uk government every single contribution they make be about the scottish government so maybe just leave it to they shall we be hop to bring forward an important amendment that be discuss quite widely in the press yesterday do not know whether the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson know this but member of the house of lords do not pay penny of tax not one penny of tax on the they get just for turn up they be among the wealthy people in this nation but not one penny of tax be pay on that money so try to bring forward an amendment to put an end to that can not believe the surprise and astonishment among my constituent and probably among number of constituent across the united kingdom when that be make apparent how on earth can it possibly be the case that members of the house of lords do not pay any tax on the allowance that they get just for turn up that be something we have to address of thing on the great long list that will never be realise in the course of this parliament how about look at that dear labour government the amendment that be most pleased to have get on to the amendment paper be the one about donor the donor be people who have place in our legislature people who can design comment and reflect on the law of this country whose only seeming and apparent ability be to give large sum of money to one of the three main uk establishment party we have hear lot about trust from member of those party and about what the public feel about politician in the political institution but how about solve this one how about take money out of the legislature how about say that if people give money to one of the three big political party they be therefore naturally debarred from take place in the legislature my sensible amendment would deal with that at stroke no more cash for honour and no more list of tory treasurer be naturally give place in the house of lords my amendment say that if someone have give more than to one of the three establishment party they be not entitle to place in the house of lords if they have give more than in the past to one of the three main uk establishment party they naturally give up their place rise what be wrong with that maybe the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell will tell but first give way to the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter be the reason the hon gentleman amendment refer only to the first three uk establishment party so that it do not affect his own party now that it have fall to be the fourth large party in this place we do not put people in the house of lords if people want to give we million pound they can please if anyone be watch on tv we could do with million pound sorry to disappoint anybody think about do that because we can not give they place in the house of lords will give way one last time to the hon member for stoke on trent central who have give way to once already thank the hon gentleman for give way again agree with he about the necessity for probity ethic and transparency in politic and also enjoy his righteous speech in this place obviously he be moral guide compass for we all so will he now make clear and unambiguous declaration that not single person who have ever donate to the scottish national party or serve as scottish national party member of parliament have ever be give position in publicly fund quango or publicly fund seat on board or be in receipt of any publicly fund donation obviously want to ensure that we aspire to the bar that the hon gentleman set what can say categorically to the hon gentleman be that there be nobody who have give one single penny to the scottish national party interruption again appeal to people watch if they want to give we money please do so but one thing we can never do we never have and never will be in return offer place in our legislature or the ability to govern in this country we do not do that we can not do that and we will never ever do that let point to the scale of the difficulty of the problem when it come to the donor some out of nomination from political party between and be for political donor who have hand over million to one of the three main party over the course of that decade some of they give million now that might sound familiar to some labour million be what people use to give to the labour party under tony blair in the early to get place in the house of lords come on where be inflation when it come to this we would expect it to cost million to get place in the house of lords now but the go rate be seemingly still about million cash for honour be disaster for labour it be absolutely awful we see the spectacle of sit prime minister be interview by the police about the donation that be be give to the labour party those donation be interpret as inducement to secure place in the house of lords the prime minister be interview under caution and two of his personal staff be arrest after that experience we would be right to expect some sort of clarity in their thinking to take place they could have decide never to get into that type of territory again that they would do everything possible to ensure that money be take out of politic so that there would never be whiff of suspicion that such thing would happen again but not bit of it donor still go into the house of lords money still go into the political party and the public want it stop be extremely grateful to the hon gentleman for give way intervene merely to say this many people might assume that he be be foolish for raise issue of financial shenanigan mismanagement conceal money bribe and so on but think that he be just be brave just as matter of record want it to be know by the whole house that this man be not fool he be very courageous man be grateful to the right hon gentleman for that will never again chastise he for quote proust in the house of commons be sorry that do that to he last time around that cover the donor the other amendment that manage to get include again this be surprise to be one relate to crony it would deny the prime minister the power to appoint people to the house of lords the prime minister have prerogative that be almost unknown to any other western industrial leader that he be exclusively responsible for appoint so many people to one part of our legislature think that something like to of the total membership of the house of lords have now be appoint by prime minister by one man that would make tinpot dictator in banana republic blush he would want those power in his hand immediately but we have they in the united kingdom we allow prime minister to determine on his own so many people in our legislature that must come to an end of course the temptation for the prime minister be to appoint his friend to reward those who have be deny place to compensate people for lose their position to encourage people to take role but mainly it be to make sure that the donor be reward think we can all pay tribute to the hon gentleman for his genius in craft amendment he have be very innovative if we see the house of lords appointments commission be put on statutory and independent footing that would go considerable way towards deal with that concern be that something that his party might consider support if that come up for vote this evening we would support it that be one way forward it certainly would deal with some of the more egregious power that the prime minister have think that people across this country forget that our prime minister have this power that he have this prerogative to singlehandedly design our legislature the more that people learn about some of these issue the well the one in seven who currently support these arrangement will fall to one in because the place be an absurd embarrassment by the way that it do business by the way that it be allow to set its membership and by the way that it present itself to the world we have an opportunity this evening to improve deal with and get some sort of solution to what this country do on democratic basis but the government be not grab it they be not even prepared to kick out the bloody bishop for goodness sake how on earth in can we be in situation where we have bishop legislate in modern advanced industrial democracy it be beyond joke we be remove the hereditarie and those on the government front bench be right there be no great objection to the hereditarie be remove do not even sense much of defence from some of our crustiest old colleague who be sit next to they half heartedly feel that they have to do it for their pal but they be not sincere and they do not really mean it they know that time be up for the hereditarie and quite rightly so it be absurd that they be still feature of our democracy in after this the bishop be go to stand out like sore thumb in cassock they will be the one on the frontline when it come to the ridicule have little suggestion for my friend the cleric down the corridor how about stick to their ministry it be not as if they be without whole range of issue just now would they not be well deploy deal with some of the thing that we have see in the news over the course of the past few day instead of concern themselves with attempt to run our country we live in multi faith and no faith complex democracy where so few people actually attend their church this historic remnant from medieval time that we have to have bishop in the house of lords be totally absurd will be support the new clause on this subject in the name of the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge in fact they be only in his name because he beat to the table office when be try to remove the class of bishop through the many amendment that table the last amendment that manage to table be bit more trivial but they address something that think we still have to consider the idea that former member of parliament should automatically expect place in the house of lords we all know what it be like do we towards the end of parliament we all ask each other well no one ask you go to get place in the house of lords then for stand down and some say ooh think so think so there be always that tap on the shoulder for the parliamentarian who may be in the autumn of his or her career we like you to do the right thing colleague would you mind think about stand down we ve get new youthful more energetic colleague who would be bit more helpful to the prime minister we make sure you all right there place in the house of lords wait for you how about end that it be feature that the public particularly loathe and despair of and it be just not right if colleague want to continue to have place in our legislature they should stand for election that be what most parliamentarian across the world do do not expect place in the house of lords have table new clause which would deal with the issue it state quite clearly that no one should be give place in the house of lords if they have serve as member of parliament in the current or last parliament think that be fair and encourage the government to think about it as the bill go forward will not be support the amendment table by those on the conservative front bench do not suppose that they would expect to do so do not even understand they and do not think that they really understand they either the opposition seem to be encourage the government to move quick when it come to house of lords reform and at the same time they be tell the government that they be go too far will let the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds who be on the front bench explain exactly what they be try to achieve because be have real difficulty follow will support the liberals democrats amendment as think they make reasonable stab but say ever so gently to my liberal colleague that they have more place in the house of lords per capita than any other political party in this place so if they be serious about develop the house of lords why do they not just stop appoint people that might have an impact because all this mealy mouthed silly reform be not do anything will finish on this point this be our only chance there will not be any more house of lords reform regardless of what the government say and know that they have say something to their back benchers to encourage they to come along today and tell we that there be further reform to come there will not be further reform all of we have see this before there be colleague on the conservative benches who have see this be there and get the shirt and that shirt say no more lords reform in this parliament that be what happen be very grateful to the hon member for give way although perhaps less so now that realise have put myself in his sight look back to the law it be tempting to be jade especially for member who be here then and to think no more reform be come do he accept however that many labour members include almost all those present today be brand new and can not be compare with that cohort we be prepared to make further reform in this parliament after all the public vote for change and we be here to deliver it will hold the hon gentleman to his word and hope that he be successful in ensure that it be hear by his front benchers will also say to he and do not mean this with any great disrespect that have never see more malleable set of back benchers than the new labour members they do everything that they be bid the way they read out the crib sheet from the whip be absolutely magnificent have not see great deal of rebellion from the labour back benchers but maybe he will show the way and ensure that something happen suspect that this will be our last opportunity to consider the matter in this parliament because it will get punt into the wait long grass the person feel most sorry for be gordon brown think he actually feel that he be go to be listen to this time and that labour be sincere about take forward his agenda after the scottish independence referendum we be promise almost federalism but instead our parliament be get attack day by day government by government back bencher by back bencher let we see if we can get back to that almost federalism let we see if we can get degree of ambition from this government it might be certainly hope so that their back benchers will hold they to account and in we they will have willing ally in achieve that this be an absolute mouse of bill but it could be make well by vote for and pass my amendment encourage the house to do so rise if there be nobody else from the government benches call rise richard baker it have be long afternoon madam chair it be pleasure to serve under your chairship may say how much enjoy as always do the witty and skilful speech of the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart he have perhaps fire an early starting gun on his own campaign for election to an elect second chamber give that the tap on shoulder will not come for he although his party will have to do somewhat well if he be to stand good chance give that he be here on his own he speak about donation for peerage we can only wonder what the snp would do with million donation but perhaps police scotland know by now give their investigation into such matter we have also speak about the delivery of constitutional reform the point that make to the hon member for perth and kinross shire be that labour have be deliver on constitutional reform serve in holyrood for three term for all the talk of the scottish national party about reform that chamber be in great need of constitutional reform but nothing have happen at all on that while in this place we be bring forward significant and important piece of constitutional reform within our first five month in government absolutely agree that we want fast pace of constitutional reform in this parliament but let we be clear about the proposal before we in we set out as an initial self contain reform that be not dependent on further reform that the right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords would be end by statute that be what we be here to deliver this evening of course it be long overdue as the minister say and that be why we have introduce the legislation so early in this government it be also important that this reform be stand alone one so we can progress it with the utmost urgency my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell be absolutely right that by take this bill forward as stand alone reform we give it the good chance of progress quickly which be what we need it to do my hon friend be make an excellent point return to the substance of today debate surely there should be agreement across the house that this reform be very long overdue as my hon friend be explain clearly and succinctly to colleague hope that people will be mindful of that and ignore some of the more outlandish suggestion make by the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart this be fundamental issue of principle it be important that we in this house recognise that the presence of the hereditary principle within our second chamber be outdated and indefensible as other member on the government benches have rightly point out the uk be one of only two country that still have hereditary element in its legislature it be not before time that we be consider this legislation the hon gentleman be make an important point about how difficult it be to defend the hereditary principle for legislator but how do he go about defend the principle of english bishop be legislator in glenrothes and mid fife we do actually have former moderator of the general assembly of the church of scotland in the house of lords very much enjoy the right hon gentleman speech his point be make very passionately and with great conviction but his party be in government as majority government for many year and it do nothing on that issue my hon friend make an excellent point not only be the conservatives majority government in this place they have plurality in the other place so they be unfettered do my hon friend accept that while the argument of the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson may be well mean bolt non manifesto commitment on to manifesto commitment risk derail bill that have already be all but agree under the salisbury convention at the dispatch box by the shadow minister the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart and therefore risk lose all form of reform that we be offer my hon friend make an excellent point could not agree more it risk derail the bill and the potential to make urgent progress on this particular issue which it be so important that we as house deal with this evening as other member have say want to make this point very clearly this reform be about principle not about personality in my own career before take up my seat in this house receive the support and assistance of hereditary member of the house of lords in many campaign on whole range of matter of public policy and value that support since my election have have the opportunity to speak with hereditary peer who have bring significant experience to the house of lords who have be diligent and committed and who have greatly value their role in the house nevertheless it be clearly the case that in advance of further reform membership of the house of lords should be base on experience and expertise not birthright the fact that there be still no female hereditary peer be another example of how that approach to membership of the house of lords can not align with what believe should be the share goal of make the house more inclusive and representative of wide society early in the debate we hear some contribution suggest that pass this bill would somehow jeopardise the work of the house of lords or reduce its effectiveness there will still be over peer leave so do not think we be in danger of shortage of peer in this parliament believe that this reform must be take forward now and have recently join the public administration and constitutional affairs committee look forward to further deliberation on reform of our second chamber turn again to the speech make by the hon member for perth and kinross shire be pleased to hear he laud gordon brown that have not always be the case in speech he have make gordon brown leadership of the commission on the uk future establish by the labour party in opposition be vital contribution to the debate on how we take forward the constitutional arrangement for government in our country the commission report absolutely need to be an active document in this parliament discuss in this chamber and hope by the select committee that have just join when we look forward to the future of our constitutional arrangement the report be right to set out the proposal for council of nation and region it show also the necessity for reform in regard to hereditary peer and why those wide reform of the house of lords will be important in relation to public confidence in our institution of government the report highlight research show that of people in the uk back overhaul the house of lords that support cut across all party nation and region nearly half the british public think that the lords do not work well support for the current composition of the second chamber be report by the commission at just believe my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell have record even low level in other research it just show why this reform be desperately require if we be to attain confidence in our second chamber analysis show that majority of member of the house of lords be base in london and the south east if we want to increase confidence in this parliament in westminster that issue must be address along with further devolution to other part of the united kingdom and the nation of the united kingdom second chamber whose membership be far more reflective of all the nation and region of the uk can only help generate great confidence in our legislature in every part of the country interestingly the hon gentleman cite the gordon brown study which one of gordon brown ally tell have just go too far and therefore be not acceptable to the labour front bench but on the issue of representation in the lords from far away and from less advantaged people to achieve the sort of balance that he describe you would have to salary the lords would you not it be very hard to provide for second home or accommodation in london on day there be many way to achieve the balanced representation that have speak about the right hon gentleman have show that he be passionate on these issue too hope that he would participate in further debate which will go much more broadly into the issue of reform of the second chamber be sure that we will have opportunity to have such debate and discussion over the next five year regrettably we must also reflect on why confidence in the second chamber be so low why have people lose faith in the second chamber have to say that it be because of the action of the previous government which so traduce and blight the reputation of the second house that this reform and other be desperately need public confidence be crucial too often despite the good effort of the speaker the member of this house and of the other house and the parliamentary authority our constituent feel detached and remote from their parliament as whole want my constituent in glenrothes and mid fife and all those we represent to have confidence in this parliament and our democratic structure as effective and connect to they and their community be sure that we all share that ambition of course there be much furth to go but very much welcome the fact that we be finally address and conclude the issue of hereditary peer as member of the house of lords it be an important step in the journey of much need reform of our second chamber the labour party promise immediate reform of the house of lords in its manifesto and set out several step that it would take however the government have introduce just one of those step the step that be most politically convenient for they be it coincidence that their proposal would remove hereditarie who do not take the labour whip they seem reluctant to take the other step very few government members seem to want the bishop to stay but perhaps their remain be convenient because when the bishop turn up they vote with the labour party more often than not object to the bill because have genuine fear that there be no second stage the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart be right it will be this bill and nothing else for the rest of the parliament labour members will wait in vain for the second stage that be what happen when the blair government try to reform the house of lords they ensure that the hereditarie remain as permanent reminder of the need for proper reform now the government be remove the hereditarie but not make clear any time scale or further proposal therefore table amendment and new clause want to pause commencement of the bill unless and until the government introduce legislative proposal for second stage reform amendment which my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart table go one well than amendment so be happy not to press my amendment and to vote instead for his it provide guarantee that proper reform will be introduce and an opportunity to reflect on the type of upper house we want believe that we should have small upper house which should be wholly or largely appoint it should not act as rival to this place liberal democrats who desire an elect second chamber do not understand what they be let themselves in for let we consider the united states where the two chamber be sometimes command by different party and very little can happen country with an executive presidential system can get away with that but parliamentary democracy could not function with government with majority in this chamber permanently block by an elect upper house my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson have table several amendment that help enact the labour party manifesto commitment retirement age participation rate and other feature that would improve the upper house will vote for amendment which commend to the cttee last time we debate this issue talk about legitimacy continuity and dignity and nothing have hear today refute the argument make then of course it be true that this house authority be draw from the democratic legitimacy that enable each of we to speak for our constituent we be choose by they and answerable to they however that be not the only form of legitimacy when the liberal democrat spokesman offer her view on the subject be minded to ask where do you stand on the head of state our sovereign be choose by birth not election head of state be critical at the apex of our constitution as point out on second reading the minister for the cabinet office for whom have great regard as he know be appoint by the monarch as be when become minister rise will give way to the hon gentleman who be edge towards the edge of his seat give his speech four out of two for energy one for enthusiasm and one for content do the right hon gentleman agree that there be clear distinction between have monarch who be constitutional sovereign and who do not withhold royal assent through the legislative process as oppose to hereditary peer who be legislate in the other place on daily basis will try to be helpful to the hon gentleman because he be new member we all learn something every day here and when member have be here for year unless we be entirely stupid we learn great deal so have pick up one or two thing the critical frailty in his argument be the difference between authority and influence of course it be true that the king grant royal assent to the bills that we pass and so they become act but the very business of he grant royal assent reinforce his authority and the fact that he have personal audience with the prime minister on weekly basis which be more than the hon gentleman ever will and more than do suggest that his influence over our affair be considerably great than that of most of the people elect here it be quite wrong to suggest that the monarch do not exercise political influence and thereby political authority also speak about continuity the importance in our constitutional settlement of the continuation of the role of the house of lords be that it provide degree of continuity member have talk about what be time honour and cast that aside as though it do not matter what be time honour count because it have be hone by generation of people not merely decide upon by one group of people at one point in time hear another speech which criticise birthright if stand here and say it be the birthright of every briton that habeas corpus prevail or if say it be the birthright of every subject of this kingdom that they can speak and think and act freely everyone would feel that it be entirely right and proper for to make those pronouncement yet birthright have be criticise in this chamber as if it be nothing the point be that the birthright the right hon gentleman describe be available to all of we whereas the birthright we be talk about be restrict to very few people some of whom have inherit they from point that be literally in the history book and be so far back and the contribution be so archaic now that it really mean nothing we have to be realistic about this and that be why we be look at the hereditary peer first some of the thing which we inherit by birth be indeed universal universal in the sense that all briton enjoy they they be not of course universal in the sense that those across the world enjoy they they would love to enjoy many of the freedom that we have earn over time due to those who come before we as the hon lady say these thing go right back the evolution of our constitutional settlement be root in history and shape over time it evolve and it be right that the house of lords evolve too so be not against lords reform per se there be case for example for say that attendance matter in the house of lords we do not have an amendment to this effect but it would be perfectly reasonable to agree that those appoint to the house of lords as life peer who never attend or attend very rarely give up their right to do so that would seem to to be perfectly reasonable and measured reform of the house of lords and it would cut the number dramatically because although we be frequently tell the house of lords have many hundred of member those who regularly vote in divisions tend to be draw from the same group on both side of that chamber there be sensible reform that could be make to the house of lords but this reform deliver neither in term of legitimacy for it make the house of lords no more democratic nor in term of efficacy because it make the house of lords no more effective one be tempt therefore to assume that it be prejudice dress with spite that lie behind this proposal and find that hard to believe give the high opinion that have of the two ministers sit on the front bench rise many of my new parliamentary opponent would never say enemy of course wish to intervene shall take they in order with the member on the right first the right hon gentleman be keen to score my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell he give he four out of and think he be rather unfair what would you give he significantly higher let we put it that way eight or nine would say if may suggest that would give opposition members between seven and out of for be patronising do not mean to patronise the hon member for bolton west phil brickell be be paternal or avuncular rather than patronise in how deal with he it be know fact prove by event that have tend to encourage new member to this house perhaps to great degree than many other senior member and that include members from across the house one of the thing that one learn here speak about the learning curve we all face be that the relationship that pervade across this house be as important as the relationship we form on our own benches have be here little while seven year and the right hon member have never encourage although he have scold once or twice he have talk about democracy and democratic reform on several occasion in his speech democracy emanate from athens and the greek republic that be the origin of demo and what do that mean it mean the common people we be talk exactly about give common people the right to sit not the uncommon people of the hereditary peerage that be the point we be talk about demos mean universal right for everyone not the select few ms nokes you will not allow to go into immense detail about athenian democracy although do study ancient philosophy the hon gentleman will know that athenian democracy be very far from the democratic principle that we hold dear only citizen have the vote in athens and the assembly there be very partial affair and certainly it would satisfy neither you ms nokes nor other member will return to the subject in hand for few moment before give way to the hon member for telford shaun davies have make the case that the bill do not afford great legitimacy or efficacy want to speak about the authority of this place the authority of the constitution and the authority of government the authority of this place as the hon member for bolton west and other have argue essentially derive from the fact that we be elect but not just from that it also derive in part from the balance in the relationship between this house and the other place bicameral system that pitch democratic chamber one against another be often less successful than the model that have evolve in this country although the upper house sometimes chastise this house it certainly scrutinise we and although it might clash occasionally with this house in its role as reform chamber in the end it defer to the elect house bicameral system bear of two houses of parliament one of which be elect and one which be not seem to to be more desirable for that very reason we do not have compete democratic legitimacy between the house of commons and the house of lords that be why disagree with the amendment in the name of some of my right hon and hon friend and with the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart the right hon gentleman be be generous with take intervention will boil it right down this government be elect on mandate to remove the hereditary peer from the house of lords not to set up wholly elect house and the concern he be talk about right now do he support the government mandate and legitimacy to remove those hereditary peer the government mandate be for more widespread reform of the house of lords will not go into it again but the manifesto of the victorious party at the general election which now form the government suggest whole range of measure to reform the house of lords do not really approve of any of those measure neither do believe in an elect second chamber as have make clear take the straightforward view that the system at the moment for the most part work pretty well we could make reform it would seem perfectly reasonable to look at how peer be appoint and we could look at the number of peer in the upper house as mention but do not really buy those reform as far as mandate be concern the government certainly have mandate to bring that package forward but the official opposition have role in both counter that and ultimately oppose it that be the nature of our parliamentary system my goodness if we vote for everything that the labour government bring forward from their manifesto there would be no point in have an official opposition of any kind rise will give way one more time to the hon lady and give she second bite of the cherry be grateful to the right hon member for take the intervention struggle to understand what the conservative party line be on the bill it would appear that he disagree with number of his colleague at the end of the day how will conservative members vote that be matter for those on the front bench see member of the conservative whips office in their place and see my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart sit behind the dispatch box these day be merely highly regarded distinguished and senior back bencher laughter the day when have any say in how the conservative opposition or in previous time the conservative government choose to vote in divisions be go but they be not go forever this be only sojourn on the back benches want to make that perfectly clear let return to my principal theme which be that of authority the authority of this house be partly bear of its relationship with the other house be the other house to become elect its authority would by definition grow and our authority by comparison diminish so be strongly opposed to an elect second chamber while accept the principled argument of the hon member for perth and kinross shire and other it be not for there be also the matter of the authority of our constitution our constitutional settlement which we have rehearse briefly in the debate be dependent on that relationship but also think it be fair to say on reform of this kind be measure it might surprise member to hear that last night be look at short book write by hilaire belloc and chesterton that book which be available from the library of the house rehearse the argument that prevail at the time of the debate on the parliament act it be then the parliament bill in the house of commons it might surprise right hon and hon member to learn as learn last night that when asquith introduce those change when the house of lords reject lloyd george budget and it become necessary to curb the power of that house rather than rush to legislate he set up conference between both side of the house to determine compromise belloc as member will remember be elect as liberal mp he parody that process and say that what come out of it be no well than what go into it none the less it be an attempt at least to reach settlement in dignified way on how we might reform the second chamber interruption it do take two election it take the election as the paymaster general will know when the liberals triumph wonder whether he want to intervene on to sharpen up the history that particular constitutional convention do not produce consensus it take two general election in one in january and one in december that be precisely right in the first general election there be an assumption that the government would proceed but the constitutional conference do not produce an outcome that bring about reform that both side could agree on further general election follow and the right hon gentleman rehearse exactly what that short book describe the point be that even asquith at that time who be determined to reform the house of lords feel that ideally that reform should be base on some kind of consensus or at least conversation about how that reform might happen and what shape it might take that be important because the authority of our constitution to some degree depend on its dignity finally want to talk about the authority of government we have talk about mandate it be long ago that the term elective dictatorship be first use the nature of the relationship that describe early between government and opposition and between different side of the chamber be important to counter the risk of government with very large majority ignore counter argument and become hesitate to say corrupted alter change or distort by the scale of the majority frankly in this parliament the labour party will be able to legislate as it choose at every turn as experienced member of the house know include those on the treasury bench government be well when they need to compromise reach agreement and consider amendment when be minister many time in bill committees in particular the shadow minister would table an amendment would routinely and systematically have the argument and make sure that the amendment be vote down but would often go back to my civil servant and say think that be rather good argument why be we do it think he or she be right we ought to alter the bill would engage with the shadow minister privately and look at way in which we could improve the legislation through that kind of scrutiny good ministers and good shadow ministers always work in that way as do with the now prime minister when he shadow as security minister government need to understand that to alter their position through that kind of exchange and consideration improve the exercise of government and add to rather than subtract from the government authority good government behave in way that rather than take advantage of their power mitigate it by the choice that they make the right hon gentleman make an important point about the need to govern responsibly and reasonably whatever one majority while be sit here be interested in his record of follow through on that strong belief so google his name and prorogation and do not see any result will the right hon gentleman perhaps reflect on any point when he think recent government might have abuse their power when be shadow minister for many year find that some of the labour ministers shadow do the job just describe very well and some do not when become minister see that some conservative ministers engage in the kind of process have describe and some do not there have always be variability in the way that power have be exercise across political party invite the hon gentleman to speak to any of the people who shadow when be minister to see if they would validate how describe the way act in those day the authority of parliament the authority of our constitution and the authority of government be all at stake as we consider these matter return to where start in term of efficacy the last time we consider these matter member will remember that quote proust it be bit too rich diet for the hon member for perth and kinross shire he be not proustian think it stretch the canon of his reading matter beyond break point today be go to test he little more and refer to chesterton who think might be more within his scope interruption from sedentary position he be acknowledge that chesterton say to have right to do thing be not at all the same as to be right in do it it be certainly true that base on their mandate the government have the right to bring this legislation but be not sure that they be right in do it measure against my test of dignity legitimacy continuity and authority for as chesterton also say before you take fence down you consider why it be put up in the first place the balance that exist at the moment both within the house of lords and between the house of lords and this house be precious it work it ai break and we do need to fix it before finish let say this to my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar we must vote against the bill on third reading because whether we be in favour of more reform as some of my colleague be or no reform the bill do not meet the standard we would expect of good legislation it be therefore vital that the official opposition make their position crystal clear by oppose this undesirable and unnecessary legislation for the record when we talk about more reform it be with low case for many people the other place in its current format embody what britain really should not be it be undemocratic it be unelecte and to touch on this only very lightly it have have its fair share of controversial appointment there be suggestion of nepotism here and dash of financial scandal there not to mention sprinkling of oligarchy therefore it represent what classist society of have and have not can produce as we know some member be there on hereditary basis and some be there on the whim and wish of political leader who of course have their own political motif for have they in position it be also clear that the different region that make up the united kingdom do not have fair representation the other place do not just have geographical imbalance but gender one none of which care for believe that there should be an upper chamber in scotland we have see some ill thought out political policy that have be financially costly an upper chamber would likely have prevent that with the benefit of add scrutiny like british society the other place need transformational change what the government propose be only step in the right direction to what as labour party member will continue to campaign for from within the party which be ultimately to change the other place into an elect chamber where class and privilege be not the entry requirement but where talent and ability be what get you there it be an honour to follow my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes such well love distinguished and senior member even if he have only serve year in this house have sit through the whole debate and do not intend to speak but just want to reply to few comment by its very nature the debate have be confrontational that be what we do in this place we tend to concentrate on what divide we rather than on what unite we and want to say something about what might unite we first of all on the idea that divide we we be debate whether to abolish the hereditarie the labour party say that it be in its manifesto and therefore it can do what it want we say that that be gerrymander that the bulk of these people be hardworke and that by nature they be conservatives so this be an excuse to get rid of large number of conservative peer the government will carry on and do it anyway that be clearly very controversial the next proposal it seem be to abolish the bishop hear what be say by my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson but there be all sort of objection to do that not least because this be an established church do we really want to attack faith community it be part of our history be the bishop really do much harm in the house of lords incidentally because of our canon law the catholic bishop do not want to be member of the house of lords anyway although they be apparently quite willing to support distinguished layman to help the catholic cause there but we all know that do not think that we will ever reach an agreement on abolish the bishop in the house of lords we have have the debate about age and again we can not agree as say early there be many people up there who make tremendous contribution in their the prime minister have appoint to the lords distinguished former foreign secretary and former chairman of the public accounts committee both of whom be and he presumably do that not think they would have to retire immediately so there be no consensus on age and there be also no consensus on whether the other house should be elect we have have this debate for year some people for instance in the liberal party say that it would be ridiculous to have an appoint parliament and that the only proper way of do this be to have elect people in the lords and then we remind they that that would just lead to gridlock this be parliamentary democracy not presidential system so there be no consensus on any of those issue however and this be the point that really want to make there be consensus on one issue namely that the house of lords be too large it have believe member which make it the second large chamber in the world after the supreme parliament of the people republic of china in view of that consensus we should perhaps reduce its size and there be surely simple way of do that give that apparently member of the house of lords be not particularly interested in turn up very often or even at all in some instance why do we not simply ask all the different group hereditarie bishop and life peer and all the different party to reduce their membership by similar percentage so that there can be no accusation of gerrymandering and reduce the size of the house of lords to about member that could be do very simply give that so many people be quite happy to have peerage but do not want to turn up it could do by election but those group themselves could decide rather than the government and there would be no question of gerrymandering they know who work hard and they know who turn up there would probably be no need for an election through that simple device we could reduce the size of the house of lords to about we could do it immediately and we could ensure that all the people who should not be there who be appoint for the wrong reason would leave the place we could do that very simply and easily we could do it by consensus and we could also beef up the house of lords appointments commission at present it can reject someone on ground of propriety but it can not do so on ground of suitability beef up its power would ensure that only the very good people be appoint to the house of lords those with experience who could make proper contribution let add just to please my friend the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart that there be no question of appoint donor and crony to the other place those two simple reform could solve the problem we have hear about constitutional conference in the past may suggest to the paymaster general whom respect greatly that it might not be bad idea for the political leadership of all our party to sit down together and organise such reform to reduce the size of the house of lords to about do we want to appoint people for life why do we not just appoint they for year so that when they have do those year they retire at the next general election all those idea be very moderate and sensible and if we could secure consensus on they we could reduce the size of the house of lords get rid of the bad apple and achieve what we want to achieve do the father of the house agree that inevitably give the nature of the bill we have be talk more about the process by which people become member of the house of lords than about the activity that it carry out in particular although not everyone in the house of lords be an expert large number of they be people who have reach the top of their respective profession whether those profession be academia the law the art or the judiciary can the father of the house cast his mind back to when he and have both fight the general election he stand in gainsborough and horncastle which be why he be in the house and stand in swansea west which be why be not co operate on try to have postal ballot for trade union election do he remember that he introduce bill that get nowhere in this house because of the strong whipping system of elect member but when we take it to the house of lords we be able to persuade people on the argument because of the light whipping the amendment go through and when the bill come back to the commons the then government bring in their own measure to meet the point do he agree that apart from create gridlock an elect second chamber would not have the possibility of introduce fresh idea that once introduce may be accept by government in this place but which would never get off the starting block if they be introduce in this place initially that be very good point remember that rebellion very well it be the start of my many rebellion suggest to labour members that they should not rebel if they want get on in this place we have rebellion and finally win on that issue and my right hon friend make very good point about how we win the argument that underline how important it be to have second chamber that be not compose of elect politician really do not see the point of elect politician to second chamber because it would just be like this place full of people who want to become ministers and who be completely subordinate to the whips what be the point of have an elect second chamber the whole point of second chamber be that it should be independent minded and the lords be independent minded they regularly defeat the government and they actually have well debate than we do the house of lords be full of people who have tremendous experience in the profession business and charity just do not see the point of get rid of they lock stock and barrel but there be perfectly good consensual argument that the number should be reduce there be some people in the lords whom we should remove either because they have not be appoint in an entirely right way or because they do not turn up far to the point make by my right hon friend bagehot speak about this issue he say that the distinguish feature of the house of lords be that its members view be emphatically their own view in his term they be not subject to social bribe by which he mean that they be not answerable to constituent in the way we be so they can make judgment entirely free of that pressure that be virtue of the current arrangement and frankly virtue of the hereditary peerage too think we can all agree that the other place for all that it be seemingly undemocratic work quite well the lords actually listen to debate and they vote accord to their conscience they regularly defeat the government and they improve bills again and again if it work why change it will the paymaster general please think about the idea that have suggest we could get some sort of compromise by which all party in the house of lords be reduce by the same amount we could reduce the lords to around member give more power to the house of lords appointments commission and in future keep the number at about be very much attract to the argument lay out by the father of the house he be right to say that consensus in these sort of matter be nigh on impossible as poor jack straw find out in the father of the house be also right to aim for reductionist strategy in try to decide what we can do to improve the situation that will get majority consensus in this house difficult though census most certainly be in these matter this debate have be characterise by some levity which be okay it be positive it probably reflect the fact that most of our constituent be not usually seize by constitutional matter which be not to say that such matter be not important because plainly they be the attendance here today be not what one might expect for matter of this importance that probably reflect the fact that when we be all knock on door few month ago this kind of thing really be not no among people concern but it remain important nevertheless confess that have be on something of journey since at which time be persuade that the upper house ought to be elect be not any more because have see in the working of this place how it be possible for this place ultimately to be challenge by subordinate secondary chamber that be itself elect try as might can not work out how it be possible to avoid that kind of situation this be the primary part of our legislature and that must remain the case we must be unchallenged but we need check and balance which be precisely what the upper house aim to provide many have speak today about who we might remove from the upper house have no objection in principle to the thing that the government be try to do but be persuade that matter of this sort should be part of wide package which be why will be support the opposition amendment today however my view be that we have probably get this round the wrong way which be why very much support the amendment be bring forward by my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson in relation to the bishop remember when be pontificate in another country majority muslim country that be nascent democracy on democracy at the end of my spiel lady put up her hand and to her great credit say have listen very carefully to what you have say but with the great of respect who be you to come here and lecture we give that you have within your legislature people who be there by dint of hereditary right and people who be there because they be part of particular religious persuasion we have hear some quote today include from chesterton be not sure whether can match that but think probably can robert burns say wad some the giftie gie we to see oursel as ither see we like that he be say that it be important to note how we appear to other people other country and other legislature and it seem to that that lady all those year ago have the measure of it we may not think we be theocracy in the same way as iran be or that we retain the hereditary principle in the same way as lesotho or swaziland do but we be and we do we need to remedy that because appearance matter and that lady be absolutely right that be why support my right hon friend amendment and hope that the government will reflect on that also agree with the assertion of the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart that this be it and that it be no good hop for another bill that bill be not go to come if it do there be no guarantee that it will not end up in the same place as poor jack straw measure end up in give the difficulty with consensus suspect that that be exactly where such measure would land so this be it do not particularly want to see our legislature populate by people who be there because they be representative of one particular faith community in this country be an anglican just like my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge be practise anglican and value the view of bishop of course do but it be simply not right to have they be politician in dog collar generally propagate left liberal world view would much rather that they be in their diocese engage in the cure of soul that be where as an anglican want to see they will certainly support my front bench measure amendment this evening very much hope that the government have be listen carefully to what have be say these grave serious matter need to be debate in careful and measure way see virtue not in plough ahead with the bill as an emergency but in incorporate it into wide set of proposal at later stage although hopefully not too late so that we can consider these thing in the round hope we will be able to see those proposal before too long live in hope the labour party have have year to consider all of this my view be that this bill will be it that be disappointing and miss opportunity it be not my original intention to speak but give the nature of the debate and in view of the signal have receive that might be give little latitude to go slightly wide than the narrow term of the bill will make single point to elaborate slightly on the intervention make upon the father of the house few minute ago lot have be say about how the public be deem to regard the status of the upper house be not sure on what basis such sweeping statement have be make although can understand that when from time to time someone manifestly unfit or inappropriate to be ennoble be ennoble it may cause degree of public concern and disillusionment new members on both side of the committee but particularly on the government side should avail themselves of the opportunity to understand more closely what the house of lords can do that the house of commons can not in the first instance peer can bring their expertise to bear that be not to say that all peer be expert they be not but lot of they be because they have reach the top of their profession they be not necessarily any bright more intelligent or more cultured than member of this house but as we choose to divert ourselves from whatever escalator we could have be on in order to become full time politician we do not reach the giddy height of those in other profession who be then able to bring their expertise to bear on the legislative process by be take into the upper house appreciate that the right hon gentleman be not doctor but could he explain the biological process by which someone inherit expertise be not aware that anything have say this afternoon have be in favour of retain the hereditarie it have not if the hon gentleman have listen to my early intervention he would have know that be the case that be why say be go somewhat wide than this bill which focus solely on the hereditarie the suggestion that the upper house stand in low repute be ill conceived and urge the hon gentleman and other new member to take advantage of the seminar that labour and liberal democrat members and try to organise to enable new member from all party to be bring into contact with lead member of the upper house to see what they do that would be good use of his and other members time my right hon friend be make an important point about the subtlety of the relationship between the two houses speak early about the relationship between the government and the opposition in an unwritten constitution political culture prevail and that political culture be inform by that subtlety and by those relationship my right hon friend describe an occasion when legislation emanate from an origin in the other place but very often legislation be improve and perfect through that connection that should not be lose as we rush headlong into piecemeal reform of the house of lords the element that make up the house of lords consist of different group of people some have get there by accident of birth and be now go to leave some have get there as the result of political horse trading of some sort and perhaps should not have be put there in the first place but great many have get there as say early by have reach the height of their various profession and have prove themselves to be outstanding intellectual who can bring level of specialisation to the scrutiny of legislation even if we in this house be on exactly their same level of accumulate knowledge we can not bring that same level of scrutiny because of the demand we face on our time and in look after our constituent which inevitably work to the cost of the amount of attention we could give purely to focus on improve legislation wish to place on record that the reason why become an ardent advocate of an unelected second chamber and why would rather have no second chamber at all than two elect chambers be precisely that it be impossible to whip such chamber to prevent people with good idea from persuade peer of the virtue of those idea member of an unelected second chamber be able to have at least sporting chance of amend legislation in good way that would not get beyond first base in this house because the elect members for the most part almost all the time obey the whipping before be an mp when be political activist and my colleague manage to get four piece of legislation into law since have be an mp have get only one on the privacy of members home address on to the statute book because exceptionally that be free vote how many free vote happen in this house hardly any the equivalent of free vote in the upper house happen all the time we require postal ballot for trade union election which be incorporate into the trade union act and the employment act we outlaw political indoctrination in school which be incorporate into the education act and carry forward in the education act we prohibit local council from publishing material that promote or oppose point of view on question of political controversy which be identifiable as the view of one political party and not of another which be incorporate into section of the local government act finally we more strictly define the concept of due impartiality in the coverage of politically contentious issue on television and radio which be incorporate into the broadcasting act every one of those measure be get through the house of lords first and then either adopt in the house of commons directly or bring forward by the government in their alternative proposal we do away with the expertise of the house of lords at our peril all we will be leave with be machine politician whether they be in one elect house or two elect houses and that be to the detriment of our democracy not to its enhancement thank you for call to speak madam chair be honour to serve under your chairmanship before begin my prepared remark wish to commend and pay tribute to right hon and hon member across the house for their skill of oratory and persuasion and their education and ability to entertain it have be an absolute privilege to hear member with such experience speak so well inform be they on such topic also wish to speak to new labour members who like be find their foot and learn the way of the world in this place be pleased to hear that they be passionate about push and challenge their party to implement the law and change that the constituent and the country demand but remind they of the consequence of that rebellion as have see in this short time be reward with sanction or suspension so it be well to get as much as possible into this bill now than to hope that they may ever get chance to do so again the house have be make aware that faith in political party and institution be at low ebb perhaps the low in my lifetime we have be tell that only of the british public say that they trust politician political party be the least trust of any uk public institution and trust in parliament be on the decline any measure that help to rebuild that trust be to be support which be why support this government bill to remove hereditary peer the anachronistic nature of hereditary peerage contribute to the sense not only that the house of lords be out of touch but that all our political institution be out of touch it feed disconnect between the people and their system of governance and reinforce belief that politic be the preserve of another elite the political elite that live in its own bubble in westminster give this urgency to rebuild faith in politic and the need for radical change to that end it be disappointing that the government have choose to be so timid in their ambition understand that further change could be introduce far down the road indeed hon member have say that they will try to push for more change for instance perhaps they could remove the from the lords or retire the bishop who be automatically give seat the lords themselves have raise the idea of remove those member who rarely if ever attend but even these tame reform appear to be too much for this government at this stage we need much bold action thank the hon member for give way do he accept that this be the first immediate measure of modernisation of the other house and that there be number of other commitment that be enshrine in the manifesto of this government which will be see to in due course in this parliament thank the hon member for his intervention agree that the bill be positive step but it be the small of the step that could have be take by this government as we all know in this place the promise of jam tomorrow be just promise and hardly ever materialise we need much bold action now it be bad enough that we be alone in europe in have fully unelected second chamber it be frankly ridiculous that with more than member it be so large will put that into some perspective the us senate have elect member who serve six year term and third of the membership be elect every two year the canadian senate have member and mandatory retirement age of and the french senate have elect member who serve six year term half of whom be up for election every three year the fact that our second chamber have be allow to balloon out of all proportion look more sinister when we consider that last year lords appointee donate over million to political party when it look like our political institution be up for grab to the high bidder with job for life be it any wonder that people see it as another private member club welcome the amendment that examine alternative model to the house of lords it be not difficult to imagine how we can improve on it there should be no place for big party donor in any second chamber it should have fix membership the public should decide who have the right to populate it and be able to hold the member accountable and it should genuinely reflect the length and breadth of our country unlike the current house of lords which be dominate by peer from the south and south east the hon gentleman seem to be make case for an elect second chamber do he imagine that that chamber would be elect at the same time as this one in which case it would be duplicate because the electorate be very unlikely to vote in different way on the same day or be he suggest that it would be elect at different time in which case the chamber that be elect most recently would surely claim great legitimacy and therefore great authority the right hon member make very important point as new member of parliament be not educate or inform enough to answer it immediately and would defer to the house to define how that process would work be listen with the great of respect and interest to the hon member do he think that there would be virtue and merit in have unicameral system bit like the plan suggest by my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis rather than have compete elect upper house because this be the primary chamber in our system again will confess to my lack of knowledge on the detail around the alternative propose by the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis would defer to the house to select an appropriate working model that well represent the people of our country the hon member make powerful point about listen and have the good system however do he agree that have all the power locate in one chamber and not have division of power as exist in other country be an idea with merit which should be look at the principle of sovereignty of course differ between english law and scots law and therefore we need to have good and proper look at our governance mechanism that be very important point agree that representation across the four nation be key and that the balance between the two houses and how they work together be also very important we have see what happen when people feel alienated from their political system they can gravitate to those with divisive answer unaddressed political grievance combine with lack of faith in political institution can be toxic combination reform the house of lords so that it be fit and proper be not the sole solution to that problem but be key part of the solution we in this house as elect official have duty to do the right thing at the right time in the right way to deliver the right outcome for our constituent and our country and the right thing be to adopt the sensible and democratic amendment that have be table and the right time to do that be now call the minister thank you madam chair be grateful to right hon and hon member for take the time to debate these issue in committee and have listen to their contribution with interest be particularly grateful to my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell as well as to other labour members for provide powerful voice in support of this important legislation be grateful to the hon member for richmond park sarah olney who demonstrate on second reading that there be strong cross party support for this first step in reform the upper chamber be also grateful to the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson who have take surprising interest in these issue and to the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart stress that we be grateful to all peer include hereditary peer who have commit themselves to valuable public service reiterate that there be no block to hereditary peer come back as life peer if their party wish to nominate they what have become clear during the course of this debate be that the conservatives do not have coherent position on house of lords reform it be not clear whether the opposition front benchers want to retain hereditary peer it be not clear whether they want fast and further reform and it be not clear whether they agree with the amendment table by the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge but what be clear be that they can not agree among themselves about the bill more division and chaos the minister will be aware that it have be over year since keir hardie commit to abolish the house of lords so to be clear will we have to wait another year for the labour party to get around to it we have take an immediate first step as set out in our manifesto to remove hereditary peer from the house of lords the hon member will know well that there be number of other commitment in our manifesto and we be consider the good way to implement they it be right that we take the time to do that properly will address the amendment new clause table by the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart seek to provide description of the purpose of the bill the government can not accept his new clause his explanatory statement say this new clause describe the purpose of the bill for his benefit be happy to clarify the purpose of the bill which should be self evident to anyone who have take the time to read it the bill be design to remove the outdated and indefensible right for hereditary peer to sit and vote in the upper chamber in no place in our legislature should be reserve for individual who be bear into certain family add that his new clause fail to take into account the presence of the law lords several such peer sit in the other place and make valuable contribution to its proceeding as member of the lords temporal under the appellate jurisdiction act his new clause therefore fall at the first hurdle and respectfully ask he not to press it to division amendment also table by the hon member for brentwood and ongar seek to delay the bill implementation delay its implementation go against the government manifesto commitment we be clear that we would implement immediate reform to the second chamber by remove the outdated and indefensible right for hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords the government set out in our manifesto number of other commitment to reform the other place and it be right that we take the time to consider how good to implement they therefore ask the hon member not to press the new clause to division amendment and and new clause which be table by the hon member for richmond park seek to impose statutory duty on the government to take forward proposal to secure democratic mandate for the house of lords via the introduction of democratically elect member although the government agree with the hon member that the second chamber need reform we can not accept this amendment this be focused bill that deliver the government manifesto commitment to bring about an immediate reform by remove the right of the remain hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords the government have commit to more fundamental reform through the establishment of an alternative second chamber that be more representative of the region and nation of the uk the government will consult on proposal in order to provide the public with an opportunity to give their view on how to ensure this alternative chamber well serve they detail of the process will be set out in due course and the house will no doubt take close interest in that process as it be take forward it be right that we take time to consider how good to implement the other manifesto commitment include our commitment to consult on an alternative second chamber engage with parliamentarian and the public where appropriate over the course of this parliament with that in mind ask the hon member to not press her amendment to division now turn to new clause table by the hon member for richmond park and new clause and table by the hon member for perth and kinross shire regard the role of the house of lords appointments commission in advise the prime minister on appointment to the other place thank the hon member for their interest in reform of the house of lords appointment process think we be all in agreement that it be vital that peer meet the high standard that the public expect of they for the good functioning and reputation of the second chamber and of parliament more broadly constitutionally it be for the prime minister accountable to parliament and the electorate to make recommendation to the sovereign on new peer as part of its role the house of lords appointments commission advise the prime minister on the propriety of nomination to the house in that role holac consider whether person be in good standing in the community in general and with the public regulatory authority in particular and whether the past conduct of that person would not reasonably be regard as bring the house of lords into disrepute the prime minister of course respect and value the commission advice and will place great weight on it when make decision on peerage recommendation the hon member will be pleased to know that the government manifesto commit to improve the appointment process to ensure the quality of new appointment and to seek to improve the national and regional balance of the second chamber so that it well reflect the country it serve the government be actively consider how this can be achieve new clause table by the hon member for perth and kinross shire would remove the prime minister role in advise the sovereign on new appointment and hand it completely to the house of lords appointments commission that would be significant change to the commission role one that would require very careful consideration this however be focused bill that deliver the government manifesto commitment to bring about an immediate reform by remove the right of the remain hereditary peer to sit and vote in the other place therefore respectfully request that the hon member not press their new clause to division new clause and table by the hon member for perth and kinross shire relate to member or prospective member of the other place who have make registered political loan or donation of over since the government believe that the second chamber be enrich by member who bring diverse experience in support of the house of lords core function of scrutinise legislation and hold the government of the day to account the house of lords appointments commission be responsible for vet all candidate for propriety and consider party donation as part of that vetting therefore respectfully ask the hon member not to press his new clause to division amendment and new clause table by the hon member for perth and kinross shire would prevent individual who be member of the house of commons in the current or previous parliament or in the previous five year from be appoint as or remain as members of the house of lords should declare an interest my husband until recently the hon member for leyton and wanstead be now member of the other place and be also government whip this be record in the list of ministers interest that be publish last week thank the hon member for table those amendment however the government can not accept they as say the government be supportive of the inclusion of individual from all background and believe that the other place be enrich by member who bring diverse experience that of course include former member of this place former member can bring valuable insight to the other place particularly with their experience of the scrutiny of legislation deny such eligibility for specific time period would be unnecessary and prevent valuable contribution be make therefore ask the hon member not to press his amendment amendment and and new clause and table by the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge relate to the lords spiritual new clause seek to remove the lords spiritual from the house of lords and new clause and amendment and be consequential to the substantive clause while thank the right hon member for table the new clause and note the number of signature attach to it the government can not accept it this be focused bill that deliver on manifesto commitment to bring about immediate reform will the hon lady give way the bill have the simple objective of remove the remain space reserve for hereditary peer in the house of lords thereby complete the process start in will the hon lady give way be very generous with my time in my opening remark and we have have full debate of course the government have commit to wide reform to the other place include establish an alternative second chamber that be more representative of the region and nation of the uk the government will consult on proposal to seek the input of the british public on how politic can well serve they however as have set out this bill be not the vehicle for consider wide change therefore respectfully request that the right hon member do not press the amendment amendment and and new clause which be also table by the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge would introduce retirement age of for member of the other place amendment and new clause which be also table by the right hon member seek to impose participation requirement on all member of the house of lords will the hon lady give way the introduction of retirement age or participation requirement be not the purpose of the bill the right hon member along with other member of the house will be aware that the government include commitment in their manifesto to introduce mandatory retirement age whereby at the end of the parliament in which member reach year of age they will be require to retire from the house of lords be sure he be also fully aware that the labour manifesto include commitment to introduce participation requirement for peer the house of lords play an important role in scrutinise legislation and hold the government of the day to account and the government recognise the valuable contribution of many peer it be important that all member participate in support of those core function rise give way thank the hon lady for give way what be be propose in these clause be very much in the spirit of the labour manifesto appreciate the fact that the government be go to whip their party hard in order to defeat their own manifesto and any potential change but will she engage with and other colleague to discuss how she could implement these change as part of the bill in the other house because there be an appetite for they and it be disappointing especially on the lords spiritual that they be go to impose three line whip on an issue of conscience it be good to see the right hon member enthusiasm for reform of the house of lords it be shame that he have only find it now that he be in opposition not over the past year when his party be in government and could have do something about it this be an immediate first step as be set out in our manifesto we have be clear that we will consult about the implementation of the other measure set out in our manifesto and we will do just that we have hear range of view today on the government other manifesto commitment include exactly how participation requirement might work the debate have show why it be exactly the right thing that the government take time to consider how good to implement the other commitment while start with the immediate reform that the bill will deliver in conclusion the amendment table by opposition members be not appropriate for the bill which deal with one principal issue the need to remove the outdated and indefensible right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords that be our objective and we be focus on deliver it the government intend to deliver the other manifesto commitment to bring about small and more active second chamber we be also committed to replace the other place with an alternative second chamber that be more representative of the region and nation as say we will consult on proposal and seek the input of the british public on how politic can well serve they reform of the house of lords be long overdue and essential the government be commit to deliver those reform and pass this vital legislation be the first step on that journey in that spirit commend the bill to the committee question put and agree to clause accordingly order to stand part of the bill clause and order to stand part of the bill clause extent and commencement amendment propose page line leave out from force to end of line and insert only when the house of commons have agree resolution which endorse the conclusion of the report joint committee appoint for the purpose specify in subsection and determine accordingly

for new forest east sir julian lewis and the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed this bill be matter of principle it have be introduce to address an outdated and indefensible feature of our legislature rather than as criticism of any contribution make by individual member the government have listen to the debate in this house with interest and look forward to follow the bill passage in the other place where be sure there will be far thoughtful contribution thank my official and the whole team who have work on the bill this house will send to the other place bill that fulfil manifesto commitment and our manifesto be very clear the next labour government will bring about an immediate modernisation by introduce legislation to remove the right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords that be precisely what the bill do it have clear and simple purpose single focus and it complete process that start quarter of century ago it send powerful message to people grow up in my constituency in blaenavon pontypool and cwmbran and beyond right across the country you do not need to be bear into certain family to make our law on third reading of the parliament bill that landmark reform of the house of lords on may the then prime minister herbert asquith say repeat as begin that our first duty in view of the electoral and parliamentary history of this measure be to place this bill on the statute book it be stamp if ever measure be stamp with the authority and approval of the electorate of the united kingdom official report may vol in that spirit commend this bill to the house call the shadow minister echo the word of the paymaster general in thank everyone who have speak this afternoon it have be good natured and interesting debate want to echo some word of my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis in praise of the house of lords when first come to this place bump into lord young of cookham who have know few year previously and say how be you get on in the upper house as minister he say it rather hard there than it be down your end when ask he what he mean he say well you see when stand up as minister in the house of commons normally feel that with the support of my official be probably the well inform person in the room but when you get to the lords you face five former secretaries of state three former head of the civil service and people with expertise from across the sector and what you find there be real scrutiny love this place and do not wish to take anything away from it but do not wish to see it replicate one of we be enough that be why despite the fact that the opposition disagree with many of the thing that the labour government be do we have be pleased to see that they have edge away from their long stand commitment to an elect upper house an elect upper house would replicate this place unnecessarily it would inevitably get in the way of the primacy of the commons and make the passage of law hard it be very significant that on march lord mandelson make an intervention with the lord speaker on his very popular podcast and say that the proposal of the former prime minister gordon brown for constitutional reform have barely be put in the oven let alone bake be very pleased that the labour government have take that on board that say the bill in its present form can not have the support of the opposition the labour party have renege on the solemn promise it make in not to get rid of the remain hereditary peer until it bring forward comprehensive plan for reform upper house many government members have say that the hereditary peer sit in the house of lords by duty of right well that be not entirely right the reason the remain hereditary peer be in the house of lords be that the labour government put they there that be the agreement that be reach in the remain hereditary peer who already sit in the lords and scrutinise night after night the legislation introduce by this house should not be treat in this way have the government respect their position and make provision for they in reform chamber it would be very hard not impossible but very hard to oppose this legislation however as it be the government be seek to remove established scrutineer in order to replace they with labour appointee and we can not support that the minister argument that the conservatives can nominate replacement be obviously not entirely genuine although we can put people forward we can not guarantee that they will go into the upper house the government could make that commitment tonight but they have not do so they have say nothing about the cross bench hereditary peer who will be remove by the legislation labour have break its promise from and it have break its promise to bring forward all its reform immediately the conservative party will not support it will endeavour to be brief think that the bill be to be welcome it be many thing but it be not fear what the government have try to dress it up as it be the fulfilment of manifesto commitment but one that be make as my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart make clear back in blair blink because my friend robert salisbury do what all cecils have do since their appointment by queen elizabeth he do bit of deal making and they find solution if you be very quiet and listen madam deputy speaker you can hear the voice of labour radical of the past mutter to themselves be that it be that what all the intervene year since and the year of labour navel gaze in opposition as it contemplate its radical programme for government have produce remove people who would have be remove in any event have blair not blink no democratisation at all of the house of lords what waste opportunity what waste period of opposition that be something hope and know that our front benchers will not replicate this timid church mouse of bill say we will take away some people who we would have take away more than quarter of century ago the paymaster general who always consider to be one of the star of the treasury bench and who be good friend tell we that the principal motivation behind the bill be for young constituent of torfaen to say ah glass ceiling have be remove as if they have sit there think you know would love to get involve in public life if it be for this roadblock to my the hereditary peer with the great of respect to those on treasury bench think that great percentage of the right hon gentleman constituent and constituent of all labour members be probably ask themselves when the labour party will crash the glass ceiling of have either person of colour or woman lead it too congratulate the paymaster general and his ministerial team on get the bill through parliament at such pace and so early in the parliamentary calendar as he have say on several occasion really hope that this will not be it as the conservatives have say this really be timid pipsqueak of bill the paymaster general quote herbert asquith word about the house of lords but could he not have quote keir hardie who pledge over year ago to abolish it could he not have quote gordon brown who say only few month ago that labour would bring forward new democratically elect second chamber to represent the nation and region of the whole of the united kingdom instead what we have be the low hang fruit of the hereditary peer be it not remarkable that it have take until to remove the earl the baron the duke all the assorted aristocrat and we be to give labour great credit for do so this should have happen several century ago not in hope that labour back benchers be not go to be disappoint because we have hear several contribution on second reading and today in committee suggest that further reform be go to be come that these be the first stage of whole package of reform that will come before this house have to say that we have hear it all before from successive government particularly labour one we be promise succession of reform to the house of lords only for nothing to be deliver so what we need to hear from government front benchers be when those further reform be go to come we need clear road map for their ambition when it come to the house of lords and that have to start with ensure that that circus down the corridor be properly reform and that we get to position where it will be democratically elect house well do to the government on get this bill through really hope that labour back benchers have not be sell pup and that they will get the further reform that have be promise to they but what we really need to hear from the government now be about solid progress on proper reform of the house of lords question put that the bill be now read the

up the road from carlisle lie his majesty factory gretna regard as the great munition factory on earth in the first world war it be where the cordite nickname the devil porridge be mixed more town than factory it stretch mile from mossband in my constituency to eastriggs in the constituency of the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell the same distance as between this house and wembley stadium at the heart of this gargantuan site be worker who live in two purpose build township the factory and the township have their own independent transport network power source and water supply system but not pub for that the worker have to walk into the small town of gretna where the number of pub could not cope with the demand and so they would board the train to nearby carlisle where pub be so plentiful that it be say that one could swing from the door of one public house to the door of the next without touch the ground thirsty at the end of long shift and doubtless relieve to have survive another day mix cordite evening shift worker would often bribe the train driver to ensure they would arrive early enough to get the drink in before closing time meanwhile in anticipation of their arrival the barman of boustead bar near carlisle station would line up shot of whisky drunkenness ensue with the landlord away fight for king and country the elderly and the widow who be leave run the pub along with deplete local police force be powerless to control the drinking the result be fourfold increase in alcohol relate offence in the city high number of absenteeism and low level of production at the gretna factory the scale of the problem be so severe that it be think to be the major contributing factor in the shortage of shell on the frontline something have to be do the munitions of war act have give the newly form ministry of munitions additional power over factory and factory worker central control board be establish with the power to control the sale and consumption of alcohol in area such as carlisle where the excessive consumption of alcohol be believe to be have an adverse impact on the war effort with the munitions minister david lloyd george already have declare drink to be the great deadly foe that britain face carlisle pub and brewery be nationalise in june some out of license premise be close with the remainder remodelle or rebuild the first state management pub the gretna tavern open just month later in july member might be interested to know that the very last state management pub the border reiver open in july just four day before the licensing abolition of state management act be pass for almost year all of carlisle public house be completely tie to the state run brewery in carlisle the beer be brew at reduce level of alcohol its advertising be tightly control and specify by whitehall and the architectural design both external and internal be oversee by state appoint architect consumer choice it be fair to say be severely limited follow privatisation the pub be sell in large job lot and snap up by the major brewery of the day mean that even to this day the majority of our pub in carlisle be own by large pub own business where the beer supply be tie to they today pub landlord continue to face restriction on what they can buy sell or serve mean that they can not always provide what their customer demand for the small local independent brewery include great corby the carlisle brewing company west walls brewing and the old vicarage brewery in my constituency get their locally produce beer sell in local pub remain challenge rise will give way first to my hon friend too have brilliant independent brewery in my constituency such as renegade and double barrelled they make huge contribution to our local economy and importantly make great pint will my hon friend join in welcome the government determination to improve access to the market for independent brewer and to get great local beer into our pub do welcome that and thank my hon friend for her intervention commend the hon lady for bring forward this debate speak to she beforehand to ascertain what she be try to achieve strangford have have resurgence of alcohol production include the microbrewer ards brewing company just few minute away from on the carrowdore road in greyabbey it be necessity that small brewer can sell in their local pub and believe it be mistake not to allow exemption for small brewery support the call to allow these exception do she not agree that we must do what we can to let the wonderful craft brewery have shot in the local market agree with the hon gentleman have visit and speak to brewer in my constituency and they tell that they just want the chance to compete on fair basis the society of independent brewers show that of beer drinker believe it important that pub offer range of craft beer from small brewery such as glastonbury ales and fine tuned brewery in my constituency do the hon member agree that small brewery should be include in the new low hospitality rate so that they no long need to pay time more pint in business rate than large brewery thank the hon member for that intervention will come later in my speech to other point that the society of independent brewers and associates be campaign on will make little more progress recently in cumbria the carlsberg marston brewing company close cumbria principal brewery jennings in cockermouth and bring to an end year of local brewing the need to create opportunity for local brewery to sell their local beer to local drinker in carlisle be therefore more pressing than ever thank my hon friend for secure this important debate have two fantastic brewery in my constituency tractor shed and ennerdale brewery which be not that far from carlisle despite the state of some of the road and rail would it not be fantastic if more cumbrian brewery find route to cumbrian pub for their fantastic beer agree with my hon friend from march next year pub tenant just yard from my constituency will be able to open up direct relationship with local brewery such as those that my hon friend refer to and have beer from small independent brewery serve to their customer the scottish pub code champion by the labour msp for west scotland who bring it forward as member bill be due to be introduce in it be similar in many respect to our own pub code which govern england and wales but for one crucial element in regulate the relationship between tie pub landlord and tenant it aim to promote fairness and equitable treatment within tie pub lease agreement it also allow scottish pub tenant to enter into guest beer agreement whereby the tenant can sell at least one beer in any format include cask and keg choose by they at price they determine they can change that as frequently as they wish the beer must be of brand where less than hectolitre be reliably tell that be about pint be produce in the previous production year that mean that it be beer from small local brewery that qualify and not that from the large brewery that will empower tenant allow they to respond to their customer request and support small local brewery introduce guest beer agreement in the rest of the uk could be worth million to local brewery it would widen consumer choice help landlord and support small local business so be delighted that the chancellor and ministers have be watch development in scotland closely and promise in the budget last month consultation on way to encourage small brewery to retain and expand their access to uk pub the consultation provide an opportunity to maximise consumer choice and support local business by enable more guest beer it be an important development and it show that the government want local community business to have the opportunity to compete grow and expand as we have hear of the beer sell in our pub come from just five global brewing company in comparison our small brewery represent only about of the market that need to be urgently review to ensure that there be level playing field where small business can compete fully on that point congratulate the society of independent brewers and associates on the launch of its new indie beer campaign which seek to make it easy for beer drinker to identify beer from independent brewery in pub bar and shop as demand for local beer rise across the uk research show that most beer drinker be unaware that the mass market craft beer brand that we see in our pub across the uk be in fact own by global brewer good example of that from my own county be wainwright beer inspire by the chronicler of our famous cumbrian fell the name wainwright be synonymous with the county of cumbria and that lead many visitor to believe that they be sample locally brew beer when they come to cumbria in fact it be just one of range of beer produce by the global beer company carlsberg the majority of beer consumer say that they want to buy beer from genuinely independent local brewery believe that siba campaign will help many more do just that these issue be wide than just the tenanted pub market with small brewery face restriction in the lease manage and free house pub market as well perversely many free house be not free at all when it come to beer sole supply contract with global brewery be prevalent restrict and determine what beer can be sell increasingly these global brewery be also use proprietary equipment in pub which prevent local brewery from even be able to connect their cask to the pub and offer their product to the landlord at all publican brewer and beer consumer in my constituency hope that the minister will be able to start the consultation process as soon as possible wonder whether the minister may be able to offer some clarity on when that might commence so that all interested party can have the opportunity to provide their insight and experience it would also be appreciate if he could confirm that this will include issue experience right across the uk include in england wales scotland and northern ireland will it also look at the whole pub market include tenant lease manage and free house will it include both keg and cask draught beer which be predominately sell in our pub finally will the minister look closely at the scottish guest beer agreement to see whether its provision could be include in our own pub code for england and wales perhaps as part of the statutory review of the pub code which understand be due next year should the minister ever find time in his busy diary would like to invite he to visit my constituency to meet some of my local brewery and to join for drink albeit not locally brew one in the border reiver the last pub in britain to have be design fund and build by the uk government before call the minister have be update on the recent wedding this weekend of the hon member for inverclyde and renfrewshire west martin mccluskey congratulate he and understand that his husband ben have be wait quite some time to see his new husband that be some pressure for the minister may start by extend my own congratulation also congratulate my hon friend the member for carlisle ms minns on secure this debate and on very engaging and well inform speech it take we through an interesting period in her constituency history be unaware of the nationalisation of pub in carlisle if that be suggestion that she wish to put forward for our next manifesto she will be aware of the policy make process and how to do that unfortunately at this stage can not confirm that we have any plan to nationalise pub that probably will not come as surprise to anyone before go on to address my hon friend point will say little more about the industry more generally because it play critical role in support local community in every corner of the uk the interest that we have have in this debate show how important pub be they be not just any other local business they be part of our history culture and heritage and they be huge employer the wide hospitality sector employ around million people the minister be make very important point because whether it be the carlisle brewing company in the hon lady constituency or kinver brewery in mine our family brewery play an important role in provide that diversity of product and high quality beer that be particular to our local community do the minister recognise the devastating impact of the chancellor change to business property relief in the budget on the future of so many family brewery across the country will go on to some of the very positive thing that be announce in the budget to help brewery and small business in particular there be about business in the hospitality sector generate revenue of around billion per annum they create vibrancy in community support wide social objective provide accessible job support community cohesion and provide welcome space for those who feel isolated and want to enjoy the company of other it be an important fact that over of the beer consume in the uk be brew here not in the palace of westminster but in the uk while uk brewer also export over billion pint of beer annually to over country accord to the british beer and pub association thank the minister for give way and thank my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for carlisle ms minns for secure the debate although we might not be brew beer in this place we do consume some of it in the spirit of shameless plug that we have all participate in this evening would like to point out that my local brewery the keswick brewing company be serve keswick gold down in the strangers bar if it be slightly easy than travel up to cumbria wonder if the minister would like to join we for pint at some point absolutely do thank my hon friend for that intervention he have obviously hear that be quite easily tempt into strangers it be very important part of the facility that the strangers bar offer member the opportunity to serve guest beer it be great opportunity to plug great local business small independent brewer often reflect their local area in their product from locally sourced ingredient to their marketing branding and style the resurgence in brew in the uk over the last decade have strengthen awareness among the general public of local beer whether it be the new style craft beer or independent brewery resurrect well love local beer that have be lose in the consolidation of large brewery the minister be quite right about the importance of local brewer stoke on trent own titanic brewery serve wonderful pint of plum porter in strangers now and again it be not just about the product they sell although if they be able to access guest beer line they could grow their business and create more job it be also about the story they tell about the history of who we be titanic be so call because captain john smith be from stoke on trent that be often miss in our cultural storytelling brewery be do great job of export who we be and what we be around the country and around the world thank my hon friend for his intervention that be really important point it be an essential part of our culture and real selling point for we around the world when people come here they want to visit traditional english or british pub and we have different style in every part of the country the point make early by my hon friend the member for carlisle about some of the large brewery now mimic the local brand be an interesting development which show that imitation be the good form of flattery more generally we know there be challenge for the hospitality sector which be still struggle to recover from the pandemic the subsequent cost of living crisis have compound the challenge for pub increase cost and the ability of business to repay debt this be an ongoing struggle our system of business rate be particularly unfair on high street business it disincentivise investment create uncertainty and place an undue burden on our high street that be why the government be undertake review of the business rate system to ensure that all business be pay their fair share recognise and address the fact that high street business include pub have shoulder the majority of the burden for far too long in her budget the chancellor announce that the government be freeze the small business multipli for to protect small property from inflationary bill increase and that retail hospitality and leisure business will receive relief worth up to per business this support package alone be worth over billion over five year it be also announce in the budget that the government would reduce the alcohol duty on draft product this will reduce business total duty bill by up to million year and increase the duty differential between draft and non draft product from to so that pint in the pub attract less duty than the beer in the supermarket the government will also increase the cash discount provide to small brewer and producer for non draught product and maintain the current cash discount provide to small producer for draught product this in effect increase the relative value of small producer relief for both draught and non draught product job too lie at the heart of our plan back by the employment rights bill which have its second reading early this month and local growth plan will be cornerstone of the place base approach we have hear already about the importance of pub in the local economy turn more specifically to the guest beer consultation announce in the budget the chancellor say that the government will consult on way to ensure that small brewer can retain and expand their access to uk pub and maximise drinker choice include through provision to enable more guest beer at this point let echo the support for the work do by the society of independent brewers and associates and the campaign for real ale in championing beer drinker choice and pursue the case for more independently produce beer in pub we will work closely with both those organisation but also with the wide hospitality sector to identify barrier to market access for small brewer and how they might be address want to ensure that we have clear understanding of the current position and of what intervention may be necessary and the impact of those intervention we want to find the right solution to help small brewer gain access to the market but to do that we will need to understand all the issue and ensure that any intervention be proportionate that they address the problem and that they do not result in unintended consequence for instance we will want to develop good understanding of the extent to which tie tenant use exist flexibility by for example buy beer from small brewer through their pub company on payment of tie release fee we will want to understand whether manage and retail pub chain could or do offer local beer to understand the scope for increase the provision of local beer in other licensed premise such as restaurant and hotel and to understand the barrier prevent local brewer from gain access to more pub and the reason for those barrier there be range of issue that we will want to consider as part of the consultation can respond to my hon friend question about what we would consider by say that we be rule nothing out at this stage and that we intend to take holistic view of the sector the next statutory review of the pub code be due to take place next year but it be only one part of the picture as it apply to only about fifth of all pub in england and wales as have be mention there be to be an interesting development in scotland whose pub code will include guest beer provision that do not necessarily mean that the provision will automatically be transport to england and wales but it also do not mean that we would not be interested to see how it pan out although as it will not be introduce until march at the early we will need bit of time to understand how it work we will be able to consider that as part of the consultation and we will of course consult formally on all the option available to we to increase small brewer access to the market it be important for we to get handle on the complexity of the market before we undertake the consultation we will work with siba and camra and will engage with range of stakeholder in the pub and wide hospitality sector before consult on option in response to the question about when this will happen can say that we will try to get on with it as soon as we can but we do want to undertake that work before launch the formal consultation we understand the point that have be make and the good intention behind the suggestion that we have hear but we want to ensure that this work for the industry as whole let end by thank my hon friend for initiate her first adjournment debate look forward to work with she on these issue in the come month and will certainly be take up her offer of drink although owe to diary constraint will probably do so on premise close to the chamber than to her constituency question put and agree to house adjourn
