public service what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service this government believe in the power of good public service to provide security and opportunity but we be clear that the way in which the state work have to change that be why we be reform the planning system to get more house build why we have introduce free breakfast club to give child the good start to their day why we have launch the ai action plan to drive the adoption of new tech in public service and why combination of investment and reform have help we to cut nhs waiting list for month in row labour be elect to get the nhs back on its foot and that be exactly what we have be do at sandwell and west birmingham hospital nhs trust in my area the waiting list have fall by since the election which mean that patient be finally get the treatment they need one of the key thing we have be do be to look at thing such as ambient ai to automate doctor note and ensure that we have modern technology in the nhs will the minister set out what we be do to ensure that the nhs adopt all technology and reform to ensure that patient be be see as quickly as possible my hon friend be absolutely right there be huge potential to increase nhs productivity through the adoption of new technology and ai as have say the combination of investment and reform have help we meet our election pledge to deliver million extra nhs appointment in england in the first year seven month early but we want to go far we want to adopt the technology to which my hon friend have refer to get maximum productivity and well outcome for patient thank the minister for his response have be contact by constituent who be concerned for his poorly elderly father who require cryotherapy that service use to be offer at his local gp avoid difficult trip to our local hospital which would have deleterious impact on his father already poor health give the government focus on move more health service into the community and people home as part of our public service reform agenda do my right hon friend agree that cryotherapy service should be consider as part of that welcome shift the health secretary have talk about three big shift that be part of the year nhs plan one of those shift be from hospital to the community which will require more service to be available locally we have agree new gp contract which will see large boost to general practitioner funding alongside reform to improve digital access if we be go to make this shift it be important that service be available in the local community the government laudable mission lead approach have see nhs waiting list fall for five month in row like many public service our nhs have be plague by over specify guidance and unnecessary target for many year so will the minister assure the house that the mission lead approach will mean focus on core non negotiable to deliver for the british people the mission set out the government long term target and the plan for change set out the key target for the next few year do believe that target can play key role in drive behaviour and that the focus on get waiting list and waiting time down set out in our plan for change can make real difference over the come few year thank the minister for that answer know from my time as councillor outside this place that under the last government policy be make in westminster with very little thought give to how it could hit frontline service more locally however example such as test and trace during the pandemic show that local service can deliver national priority effectively so what can the minister do to ensure that civil servant down here work well with frontline worker up there to make sure that this government priority be be deliver the hon member make very good point it be really important that we change the way in which policy be make that we listen more to the frontline and work with the test and learn approach that be refer to by the minister for the cabinet office in answer to the previous question that can help drive well outcome for the public it be clear to that under the last government our state fail the public we have an agenda that be not root in the life of everyday people mean that despite the number of civil servant be the high in generation outcome for my constituent in wirral west and people across the country be bad will the minister please set out how small more modern and more focused state can once again deliver world class public service over recent year the public have see the state get big and taxis go up but they have not always feel that they be get the right outcome from those change to deliver our plan for change we need to reform the state to make it more efficient and more effective we have start to deliver those reform through strong performance management accelerate ai adoption focus on the frontline and reform rule around recruitment and secondment those plan will help empower our excellent civil service to work well reduce bureaucracy and focus on what really matter which be well outcome for the public commend the ministerial team both on the innovation fund and more importantly the test and learn culture that have be refer to which embrace willingness to take risk and iterate do the minister agree that in order for this work to be truly successful and transform our public service we must also reform our governance and approval process in parallel so that they do not inadvertently stifle this welcome method of innovation the right hon member obviously have hugely important experience in this regard he will know from that experience that the traditional system can be risk averse and that it can seek to resolve too much and try to cover every base before launch policy the test and learn approach be different by intention it intend to start small and to build from there what be absolutely certain be that whether it be his party or my party in power there be duty on any government today to pursue reform of the state to improve outcome for the public so in that regard agree with he number of month ago the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster announce the plan for change and the pillar mission and various other thing that come with it when will he update the house on how that be go and how the government be meet those target well have good news for the right hon gentleman laughter this be parliamentary accountability in action one of the key target in the plan for change be to get waiting list and wait time down be pleased to report to he that they have fall for five month in row and that we have meet our first step on million extra appointment early and look forward to more progress in the future with job set to go at the cabinet office by please can the minister confirm what impact those cut will have on his department what responsibility might be transfer out of it the cabinet office have triple in size in the past decade or so think it be right after growth like that that we look at productivity and how to get the good outcome for the public we have introduce mutually agree exit scheme some of the headcount reduction will be by transfer function to other place but believe that the cabinet office can absorb headcount reduction after as say triple in size over the past decade or so can the minister outline government plan to reform the funding of fire authority that be especially important in somerset where change to employer national insurance contribution the ending of the rural support grant the removal of the service grant and the reduction of the pension grant will cost devon and somerset fire authority nearly million year at time of rise cost do not want to interrupt the collegiate mood we have have this morning by point out that we have to take those decision after the inheritance we receive can not speak for every local authority settlement around the country but the local authority settlement announce after the budget be on the whole well than they have be for many year they will not make up for the past year but they be well settlement than many local authority have see for some time thank the minister very much for his answer to those question the reform of public service be important and welcome the idea he have put forward know he have deep interest in northern ireland be it possible on his journey to northern ireland understand that he go regularly for he to discuss the reform of public service with the northern ireland assembly and the relevant minister to ensure that we can have the same benefit that come from what he be put forward today thereby improve service and save money at the same time it be important that we have good dialogue between all the devolve government and the uk government believe that we do have that good dialogue in place at the moment there be always different political party represent around the table and people will come at thing from particular angle but when it come to this kind of agenda the question be how do we get the good value for money for people how do we get waiting list down and how do we make sure that the taxis that people pay get the good possible public sector productivity there be common agenda there and see no reason why we can not keep work productively together on that emergency preparedness what step he be take to strengthen emergency preparedness what step he be take to strengthen emergency preparedness the government be introduce range of measure to strengthen our emergency preparedness we hold regular cross government planning exercise for range of scenario later this year we will undertake pandemic response exercise and we will also undertake national test of our emergency alert system next week my right hon friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster will open the new uk resilience academy which will train over people year thank the minister for her response and particularly welcome the propose test of the emergency alert system the demise of landline and the switch off of the public switch telephone network mean that resident particularly those in area that suffer prolonged power outage such as part of my carlisle constituency now rely on their mobile phone more than ever in emergency event do the minister share my desire to see ofcom expedite its work on the radio access network resilience project so that we can move towards position where the network put in place emergency generator to switch the mast back on in the event of prolong power outage this be an issue that recognise and reassure my hon friend that my colleague in the department for science innovation and technology be work very closely with telecom company and ofcom to ensure that consumer be protect throughout the public switch telephone network migration as she mention that will include provision to protect access to emergency service during power outage local resilience forum such as northumbria lrf and durham and darlington lrf which cover my constituency play very important role in identify potential risk and support our local community can the minister tell the house how the government be work with these local forum and how they will ensure that their insight feed into the government planning and preparation for risk such as pandemic thank my hon friend for her important question the government recognise the importance of local resilience forum and the role they play in boost resilience in place and community hope she feel reassure that have meet all local resilience forum across england to discuss their concern and have also meet business to talk about the importance of local resilience we will continue to work closely with local resilience forum include northumbria lrf in her local area to plan and prepare for broad range of risk include pandemic while be police and crime commissioner see many of the thing that have be refer to by hon member as critically important for emergency resilience plan across the public sector and work with the private sector to ensure that that be all target in the right way it be key to make sure that all the different agency public body and company have share understanding of the risk that we face as country and receive the late update on those can the minister tell the house when the government will next update the national risk register and explain what plan ministers have for the frequency with which those update will be publish thank the hon member for his work in this space because know he have do lot of work on this issue we be constantly look at the risk register and update it and lot of work have be do alongside that we be carry out resilience review as he rightly point out we need to work across wide range of sector to make sure that wide society play great role in this matter and the work that have be do have involve meeting business voluntary organisation and vulnerable group to make sure that the issue be reflect we will make sure that we share the lesson learn with the house in due course and have also engage with parliamentarian on this issue in the last few week dorset have be ravage by wildfire especially upton heath and canford heath in my local area where more than acre be go be blow away by the work of the fire crew from dorset wiltshire hampshire and the isle of wight will the minister thank the fire service for their combine work but also acknowledge that there need to be review of funding for emergency service to ensure that they be consistently able to protect we in the face of climate change ask she for that assurance thank the hon member for raise such an important matter want to put on record my thank to the emergency service which have be do lot of work on the ground particularly through local resilience forum and her work as local mp as part of the resilience review we be look at the issue she have raise we be also work collaboratively across department to make sure that the climate change matter she have raise be look at because they should be look at not only by the cabinet office alone but across all departments call the shadow minister would like to turn to the sorry state of labour run birmingham where rat the size of dachshund be terrify local resident indeed in the daily telegraph this morning we read that birmingham city council warn of surge in rat bear disease that the elderly disabled people and baby be particularly susceptible to the government have have emergency power throughout this crisis not least the civil contingencies act will the minister set out for the house why they have decline to use they thank the hon member for his question and be sure he would like to join in praise the deputy prime minister and her team for their hard work on this lot of the rubbish have be clear and want to take this opportunity to thank all the staff in birmingham and across departments who have play key role in respond quickly to and deal tirelessly with this matter be afraid be not go to congratulate the deputy prime minister in much the same way that the people of birmingham be not thank she either very much hope that the deputy prime minister will take the prime minister and maybe the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster to birmingham to see that in fact much of the rubbish have not be clear also hope that the labour party will undertake not to take any donation from unite the union while this crisis be ongoing the government have commissioner in birmingham at the moment but we know from answer to parliamentary question that the commissioner be not involve in the negotiation to end this ongoing problem with the local union the government have power to do so why be they not use those power and when will they bring an end to these strike and set the people of birmingham free thank the hon member for the question but be slightly disappoint by the approach he have take it be important that we work collaboratively together as he rightly point out birmingham be the focus here and let we move the politic out of it it be important that the dispute be resolve as swiftly as possible and that be what the deputy prime minister and her team be do at the moment datum what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the use of datum by government departments when we come into power the government commission comprehensive state of digital government review which demonstrate just how far we have to go it set out picture of fragmentation silos and failure to maximise the opportunity of datum to personalise and target service the average uk adult citizen spend week and half deal with government bureaucracy every year the government have set out plan to change this and we be take wide range action from create the national data library to increase the number of service that use one login be glad the minister mention the government state of digital government review and its fairly excoriate conclusion it be clear that the public sector be not use datum well enough it detail the challenge barrier and reluctance in get the good out of the datum available to departments some can not even get their own arm length body to share datum with they and if we use datum well we can deliver government well would the minister meet to discuss far how the cabinet office can lead in act on the lesson of the review and ensure that the citizen experience be put at the heart of the change it make would be delighted to meet the hon member be very passionate about this in local government see how difficult it be for frontline staff who be not able to get datum from different service most importantly citizen be have to tell their story to and share datum with multiple service which cause confusion we be work very closely with the new digital centre of government on this and we have an action plan to address it however always welcome new idea because this could be really transformative for citizen too often when be try to get to the bottom of problem for my constituent in ribble valley get response to write question say that minister just do not have the datum available applaud the government for put datum at the heart of their plan but worry that we could get too carry away with look at ai solution before we get to solution for actually collect datum in the first place could the minister reassure on how we be work with local government to make sure we be collect datum from all possible source in one place to start with before we get to how we can make that more efficient the two issue be completely link to use the opportunity of ai which be enormous to personalise service and target prevention we need to have clear datum picture we need to be able to bring datum together across different level of government there be huge amount of datum in government but some of it be stick in legacy system and not share properly this be the absolute bedrock of the opportunity around ai so it be something we be very committed to especially work with local government call the shadow minister hope to continue the positive cross party approach to this question particularly like the minister commitment to clear datum picture the sullivan review into government datum be publish in march this year and professor sullivan make recommendation to ensure that across government accuracy and consistency be maintain do not expect the minister to have full formal response to that review today however can she reassure that the government will issue full formal response to the review and its recommendation to provide that clear datum across government within say year of the report publication appreciate this collegiate style of discussion there be huge amount to do here when we come into power we set out as say review of the picture that show just how hard it be for citizen to negotiate when move home one have to announce it to different organisation use different public service sometimes different service so we need to change we have not wait for the review we have already set out our own plan but we will of course respond to external review that come forward civil service reform what step he be take to reform the civil service let thank the thousand of diligent and hard work civil servant who be dedicate to make people live well we want to get the good for civil servant and out of civil servant so we be reform the structure and the focus so that it be well place to fulfil that purpose that include number of important step in recent week robust performance management well use of digital tool fast recruitment cut to some wasteful spending and review of the arm length body landscape include the change announce on nhs england to return both power and responsibility to elect representative thank the minister for his response and be perfectly happy to accept the diligence of the civil service regardless every two year third of the civil service change their department and countless more change to unrelated policy role within each department under the previous government policy expertise be completely hollow out from the civil service will the minister set out how we intend to resolve that to bring policy expertise back into the civil service and ensure we have government team capable of deliver for britain it be probably true to say that long hold frustration of some ministers have be turnaround and the pattern of career progression where people move on after few year just as they be become an absolute expert in their area our ambition be not just to have policy expertise but to change the way that policy be put together in the first place that be why the test and learn approach which we discuss early in this session be so important frankly the old way of have group of expert write white paper throw it over wall and hop it will work first time just do not work in today age what we really have to avoid be two speed world with massive innovation in the private sphere and public sphere work in the same old way we have to avoid that in the interest of the public the right hon gentleman talk good game about scrap quango and support the review he announce to reduce the size of the bureaucratic state why then despite the rhetoric be the government at the same time create dozen of new quango this be another debate which have go on for many year and relate to the question of headcount government can magically reduce headcount by create quango somewhere but the headcount may not have change at all what be inform the drive this time be the fiction that an arm length body can somehow absolve ministers of responsibility it do not work like that in the real world sometimes there be good case for have an arm length body but in the end we know that accountability will be with ministers and that be what be inform how we look at these thing at the moment call the liberal democrat spokesperson have listen with great deal of interest to what the right hon gentleman have have to say on the government plan to make whitehall more efficient and to make significant reform to service delivery and we on these benches very much welcome the intention behind that statement however announcement have be make in the medium about the intention to cut job in the cabinet office and reduce the department workforce by third why have we not have statement in this house about those job cut specifically and when will members of parliament get an opportunity to scrutinise exactly what that mean for their constituent and their expectation about service delivery work very closely with the chancellor of the exchequer and the treasury on this matter the truth be civil service headcount grow by more than in the year the opposition be in power we believe that some of that can be explain by the repatriation of power after brexit but some of it can be look at in term of efficiency which be what we be do by reduce the government overhead we can devote the resource to where they be really need in frontline public service after such growth preside over by the conservatives over the past decade we believe that can be do co operation with devolved government what step he be take to strengthen co operation with the devolved government what step he be take to strengthen co operation with the devolved government what step he be take to strengthen co operation with the devolved government what step he be take to strengthen co operation with the devolved government my right hon friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster speak few moment ago of good dialogue we be commit to work with the devolved government across the uk and there be frequent proactive engagement between ministers and their devolved counterpart to achieve that for example we have work with the scottish government on the joint investment plan for grangemouth with the welsh government through the tata steel port talbot transition board and alongside the northern ireland executive on the city deal the minister will be aware of last week historic uk supreme court ruling on the definition of woman be base on biological sex which provide important legal clarity it be critical now that the uk and scottish governments work in co ordinate manner to ensure that the practical impact be understand how do the minister plan to ensure that this co ordinate approach deliver for woman in scotland and across the united kingdom and do he agree that the ruling must be lesson for the snp government to stop waste scottish taxpayer money on flawed legislation and court case the ruling uphold the protection of single sex space base on biological sex and bring welcome clarity and confidence for woman and indeed service provider the equality and human rights commission as britain equality regulator have already commit to support service provider with update guidance on the specific point raise by my hon friend we will meet scottish counterpart to discuss the implication of this significant judgment thank the minister for his answer to the early question event such as tartan day provide vital opportunity for company such as rse in cumbernauld to promote their product to international market rse have repeatedly tell that it want to be part of brand scotland will the minister outline how he will work with the scotland office and the scottish government to ensure that tartan day be an even big success next year to secure investment in the scottish economy and create scottish job let first pay tribute to rse and all its brilliant work on water tech early this month have the pleasure of represent scotland in the united states along with my right hon friend the secretary of state for scotland at tartan week where we meet range of business and investor to bang the drum for scotland as great place to invest and to work it be frankly powerful opportunity to show that scotland have two government commit to its prosperity and wellbeing as the uk government commit to growth we be more interested in new market than old argument and my right hon friend the secretary of state actively reach out to the first minister seek to co operate by co ordinate our presence welcome the step that the government be take to strengthen co operation with the scottish government to cut waste and inefficiency and to ensure that minister take responsibility for public service this be an important area for potential co operation and dialogue because in scotland we currently have more quango than there be msp in holyrood which waste million of pound year do my right hon friend agree that the snp scottish government should stop hide behind these quango end the culture of waste and take responsibility for plummet standard in scottish public service echo the sentiment of my right hon friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster the powerful point he make about the ultimate ministerial responsibility rest rightly and reasonably with elect representative apply north of the tweed as surely as it do south of the tweed only wish that the scottish government would use the power that they have to do the same and actively cut waste and bureaucracy scotland deserve well than what we be witness just now do the minister agree that this labour government plan for change have help to deliver more gps to help stop the am rush and that the scottish government should work with the secretary of state for health and social care to look at how the snp run health service in scotland could learn from such action as the uk government we have deliver more than million extra nhs appointment seven month early as the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster set out just few moment ago yet we all know that despite the brilliance of nhs staff the nhs in scotland be still on its knee today from this dispatch box urge our colleague in the scottish government to work with we and actually learn some lesson from our team in the department of health and social care who be already drive change across england of course if the government be serious about co operate with the devolved government tomorrow second reading debate on devolve immigration policy to scotland which have be secure by my hon friend the member for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins would not be necessary the minister will recall that in the run up to the general election labour deputy leader in scotland jackie baillie say that they would be open to talk on this issue and of course it would be unthinkable that she would have say such thing just to gain short term electoral advantage therefore have wait year can the minister tell we when he expect those talk to open in the spirit of collegiality that have be the hallmark of this question session so far let respectfully suggest that there be fundamental philosophical difference between our two party the snp want to end the united kingdom and we believe in devolution which be ultimately two parliament two government solution there be two government who represent the good interest of the united kingdom and in that sense appreciate that there be constant demand and constant set of grievance from the snp about why devolution be not work it be about time that we have government in scotland who be committed to make devolution work far to the question from the hon member for airdrie and shotts kenneth stevenson give last week uk supreme court ruling which welcome as return to common sense and biological reality what step be the minister take to ensure that government message reflect this clarity and that it be implement consistently both across the devolved region and here in westminster can assure the hon lady that the equality and human rights commission which have remit across the nation and region of the united kingdom have already commit to support service provider with update guidance assure the hon lady that we be talk to colleague in scotland and that we will also be talk to colleague in wales and indeed in northern ireland local authority procurement economic growth what step he be take with cabinet colleague to assist local authority in use public procurement to help create economic growth welcome the house continue passion for procurement and my hon friend have help to lead the way in this area at hammersmith and fulham council have see how much energy there be in local government to use procurement to deliver job and growth the government be work on plan to allow local authority to reserve contract for local employer public procurement can be key tool in drive growth and support business across the economy our new national procurement policy statement look to maximise spend with small business and ask contract authority to work collaboratively on local and regional growth plan thank the minister for her reply and for the excellent work she have do in put together the procurement strategy it have be passion of mine for many year that we do not use procurement just to get extra social value but extra economic value which will help local firm and local growth that be what this statement do and hugely welcome it may ask the minister whether she intend to issue guidance to local authority so that they know how good they can achieve economic value for example they could proactively tell small firm what contract be come up or train they in how to tender which be very difficult for they the government could also encourage local authority to break procurement into lot so that small firm have well chance of bidding finally local authority could stop require an unreasonable number of year of account to be show before small firm be permit to bid growth be the no mission for this government we have learn from local authority such as hammersmith and fulham which build economic value into procurement the procurement act make new tool available but what be critical be how they be use to deliver innovation and growth the government will be consult on new plan to set target for small and medium sized enterprise use for the wide public sector we have deliver extensive training and develop new community of practice to help make the most of this huge opportunity as my hon friend have say much of this be about culture and the use of the tool we will be work with local authority around the country to deliver on this enormous opportunity my constituency be food production powerhouse and welcome any step by the government to encourage local authority to procure british produce food local authority be under extreme pressure to procure at very low cost what step be the minister take to ensure that first the groceries code adjudicator ensure that farmer be pay fairly for the food they produce and secondly the department for business and trade be not about to undermine the food they produce by enter damaging trade deal with the us that would undermine those standard the guidance we put into the national procurement policy statement make it clear that we want to deliver good value for money which mean not just cost but ensure that we support growth and local supplier that allow local authority to make decision on what will create job and good opportunity for community in the procurement of food plan for change what recent progress he have make on implement the plan for change this government be elect with an overwhelming mandate to deliver change we inherit country hit by an unprecedented cost of living crisis with million stick on waiting list and community blight by crime and antisocial behaviour we be already deliver the change we promise there will be pay rise for million worker thank to our increase in the national minimum wage nhs waiting list be down six month in row and there be fund for neighbourhood police and community support officer that be the change we promise and that be the change we be deliver thank the minister for her answer it be really impressive catalogue of achievement in the early month of the government can the minister set out more specific detail for my constituent and the house on big infrastructure project such as the low thames crossing be delighted that the government have now give consent to it and dartford resident be delighted too how can these big infrastructure project not only kick start economic growth but provide job skill and opportunity for resident in dartford and across the thames estuary my hon friend be great champion for the people of dartford fix britain creak infrastructure be vital for our growth mission and plan for change we be reform our planning rule to cut through blockage to deliver infrastructure and to help meet our target of planning decision by the end of this parliament the government be commit to work with the private sector to deliver the low thames crossing as well as create job it will reduce congestion and drive economic growth by improve connectivity between kent and essex as the minister be

that the cabinet office be responsible for eu reset negotiation what assessment have the cabinet office make of the cost of the uk not be in custom union with the eu the minister for the cabinet office have be negotiate with the eu in the country national interest we have be clear that there will be no return to the custom union or single market but the reset in our relation with the eu be an important one call the shadow minister key to much of that plan be the government target to make the uk the fast grow economy in the but with the international monetary fund join the office for budget responsibility and the oecd in massively slash projection for uk growth and the imf not expect the uk to be the fast grow economy in the in any year between now and how confident be the minister that the government will meet that target the prediction be that we be set to be the large grow european economy in the since come into government in july we have prioritise growth for example universal studios build europe big theme park in bedfordshire and unblock planning decision on project like the low thames crossing we be get on with deliver the growth that the country need after year of decline under the conservatives topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility since the last oral question we have be work to create more focused cabinet office that will drive the work of reform and help to deliver on our plan for change we have take decisive action include by cut wasteful spending so that resource can be target on the frontline be pleased to inform the house that will shortly be open the uk resilience academy which will be an important resource in train public servant for range of potential emergency be sure the minister will agree that the diversity of those in position of responsibility across all area of uk government and public institution be key to maintain confidence among the british public that the government be work for all of we diversity be important across all the various equality strand as well as the various geographical area of the uk nation and region will he detail what work have be do to review the diversity of

will understand know she have job to do in hold we to account on that but it be really important that we allow those technical talk to go on at that level between the principal and she will understand why that be necessary agree completely with the right hon lady point about the sanction against member of this house which utterly condemn this be par for the course when it come to putin and his

have not change we do not recognise russian sovereignty over any territory illegally seize from ukraine include crimea when how and on what term this war come to an end can be decide only by negotiation with ukraine at the heart of they as one of the individual who be sanction yesterday by the kremlin ask the minister whether he agree that if putin be serious about secure any sort of last

aggressor in this conflict call liberal democrat spokesperson james maccleary overnight russia launch ballistic missile and nearly cruise missile and drone at civilian target in kyiv yesterday talk in london should have be an opportunity to strengthen the western coalition support for ukraine in the face of putin barbarism instead they be derail by president trump who in petulant response to president zelensky refusal to countenance the recognition of crimea as russian withdraw his secretary of state and special adviser from the meeting president trump demonstrate that he be not interested in secure just peace that can deter future russian aggression and protect ukraine right to self determination instead he be intent on secure carve up of ukraine with putin as long as it be agree before the day of his presidency will the minister make clear to his us counterpart that the apparent ultimatum share with president zelensky last week which would deliver to putin most of the goal of his illegal invasion be utterly wrong and would only embolden future russian aggression too yesterday find myself on list of mps from across the house who be be sanction by the kremlin will

european ally the united states and other and we be work closely with president trump on that but we be also clear that ukraine voice must be at the heart of any talk we warmly welcome the agreement

time the right hon gentleman ask important question he have hear what have to say about the abducted child and completely share his passion and his horror at what have happen will not go into the

missile that be utterly crucial and make tangible difference not least in the face of the barbaric attack that we see overnight welcome fresh member to the list of those of we who have be sanction why be president trump treat ukraine as the aggressor will the minister remind us negotiator that together with the united kingdom the usa sign the budapest memorandum assure ukraine of its territorial integrity and independence when that country sacrifice unilaterally its position as the world third large nuclear armed power welcome the right hon gentleman support on ukraine but again do not share

just and last peace as have say it be very clear to we that president zelensky and ukraine be demonstrate and have demonstrate clear commitment to peace include through their participation yesterday alongside the us and our european partner we know who the real obstacle to peace be vladimir putin do the minister agree that as other hon member have allude to last night brutal attack on kyiv be timely reminder to government and leader around the world that russia be and always have be the aggressor in this conflict do he agree that that perspective must be central to any talk as we stand with ukraine for as long as it take as have say we be absolutely unequivocal that russia and vladimir putin be responsible for this war and we be absolutely clear that they be responsible for the ongoing killing and aggression that be why we stand four square and iron clothe behind ukraine and we be work with the united states and our european ally to achieve peace that be just and most importantly last we know that putin demand and intention remain undiminished and we need to ensure that ukraine have the ability not only to defend itself but to deter future aggression by putin this weekend will join with the ukrainian community in torbay to mourn the sad loss of ukrainian national who have die far from home almost child have be steal by the barbaric putin regime can the minister advise the chamber on what practical step the government be take to get those child home be able to discuss some of the practical step that we be take on this important issue just few week ago with

see step forward take in due course be very happy to update the hon gentleman in write with further detail be ashamed to admit that have not yet be sanction by russia be feel little bit lonely clearly have to do more to call out putin barbaric war crime this house be always at its most united and its most passionate when we be talk about the need for just peace in ukraine so can ask the minister very delicately whether he be convince that all our international ally understand that for peace to be last it have to be just think that be well understand and it be point that we continue to underline in all of our conversation whether across the atlantic across europe or with other party internationally it be why we have support the important work on the special tribunal on the crime of aggression it be why we be support action on justice for crime that have potentially be commit in ukraine and it be why we be continue to support key institution within ukraine on these issue and have work within the council of europe on these issue too we have be very clear that justice must come alongside sustainability and ukraine ability to deter future aggression and of course to defend itself and its people right now the assistance that we have provide to our friend in ukraine have include firefighting equipment along with training on the use of that equipment the devastation that take place overnight demonstrate that that assistance be still inadequate so will the minister undertake to review with the fire service minister the hon member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris what extra provision we can provide if we can not provide anything will he reach out to our international partner to encourage they to supply equipment so that the fire can be bring under control and people life save the hon member raise an important issue and know the huge support that have go in indeed work with colleague on some of that in the previous parliament one of my friend in ukraine be call up as military firefighter in respond to some of those attack on the city the need be huge and we have be give huge amount of support on reconstruction energy infrastructure and other issue be happy to look at the issue he raise and to see whether there be more we can do in that regard pope francis describe pride as the most devious of sin but wonder if we can be grant little bit of indulgence and the minister can take some pride in colleague from across the house join the fine group of those who have be sanction by russia however those who be do the hard yard be in ukraine can the minister assure we that he believe that the united states still believe in ukraine territorial integrity for which those brave ukrainians be fight have be clear that we be work closely with president trump and the united states our european partner and other refer the hon member to the comment make just short while ago in response to the shadow foreign secretary we be clear that ukraine must be at the heart of these negotiation that be why we be work closely with the united states with our european partner and crucially with ukraine that be exactly what be happen in the technical talk yesterday here in london on tuesday ask the defence secretary what our red line would be at yesterday peace talk regard any peace proposal from the us that require ukraine to cede any of its sovereign territory to russia do not receive an answer yesterday us vice president vance tell reporter now of course that mean the ukrainians and the russians be both go to have to give up some of the territory they currently own can the minister now state that the government will not support any us proposal that see russia make territorial gain at the expense of ukraine upon any permanent cessation of hostility the hon member will understand that like the defence secretary will not be draw on the detail of the discussion yesterday the only person that that would benefit be vladimir putin we have be clear that we share the united states desire to bring this barbaric war to an end ultimately though it be for ukraine to decide its future our position on that have not change and that be why we be work closely with ukraine our international partner and other to end the bloodshed and suffering cause by russia we be clear on who the aggressor be in this situation we will continue to stand iron clothe with ukraine have nothing new to say about this but since be one of those include yesterday in the list of those who be no long welcome in the kremlin not that have think ever would be feel compel to place on record that my determination to oppose and expose the brutality and illegality of vladimir putin and his government be great today than it be yesterday can the minister do what he can to make sure that our resolve in this house be hear in the kremlin and also if necessary in the white house be absolutely sure that the voice in this house be hear across the world have no doubt that the kremlin be watch what be be say again condemn the sanction against the right hon member and other members across the house this terrible aggression by russia and by putin have often have the exact opposite effect of what he intend it have strengthen nato unity and we have new member of nato increase defence spending increase resolve increase unity and increase willingness to stand with ukraine not just now but year into the future that be the message that we continue to send from this house and that we continue to send from our ally it be the message that we must continue to send at the london talk do the government have the opportunity to discuss with ally the deployment of member of the chinese people liberation army in support of russia against ukraine be not go to get into the detail of the talk yesterday but will make it clear to the hon member that we be act robustly against third country support for russia illegal war include through our sanction we do so in relation to series of matter include the support of military industrial company and other the foreign secretary raise concern with his chinese counterpart on china supply of equipment to russia and the democratic people republic of korea relationship with russia we engage very closely on third country support in whatever form that take and we be not afraid to take action where that be necessary welcome the uk government recent commitment to strengthen their energy partnership with ukraine which be crucial for europe energy independence recently visit urenco capenhurst

terrible attack that have be take place but we have also be work on how we might co operate together on energy in the future that be crucial question for all of we across europe continually raise with european and other counterpart the issue of remove the dependency on supply from russia and elsewhere we need to look at new partnership and way forward in which we can support all our energy need whether that be through renewable through nuclear or in other way this be an important issue and thank the hon lady for raise it can the minister update the house on whether yesterday meeting involve discussion of any potential future co operation between the us and russia on energy if it do do he impart to his us counterpart that such an arrangement would be folly as say before will not get into the detail of talk and discussion we be very clear on our position which be that we need to support and stand with ukraine we be have productive and constructive talk those continue yesterday with the united states european ally and other and refer the hon gentleman to the answer give to the hon member for ynys môn llinos medi moment ago how can the minister describe yesterday talk as productive if

hugely concern as be sure the whole chamber agree may please urge the minister and the department to use whatever leverage they have with the us administration to prevent that from happen if it do go ahead what will the government next step be the hon lady ask an important question about sanction the prime minister have be very clear that sanction against russia be vital part of our armoury and the uk be commit to maintain our russia sanction we be not consider lift they as the pm say in paris in order to get russia to the table we need to keep up the economic pressure to hinder its ability to wage war and we need to deal with all the way in which the war be be fuel and supply the purpose of our sanction be very clear to stop russia threaten and undermine ukraine sovereignty territorial integrity and independence to help ensure that russia pay for the damage it have cause and to make sure that ukraine be place in the good possible position to secure just and last peace we will continue to work with the united states and all our ally on those important issue far to the last question there be rightly concern that russia continue to bypass sanction through its shadow fleet what measure be the government take alongside our ally to prevent that since this government come into office we have ramp up our effort particularly on the issue of the shadow fleet on which we first seek sanction at the european political community summit just day after come into office can tell the hon gentleman that the impact of those sanction have be substantial in constrain and take down russia ability to wage this war collectively the sanction by the previous government and this government have prevent billion worth of support to fuel russia war that could have pay for another three or four year of military aggression against ukraine we will not hesitate to consider further action in this area indeed we have announce some of the big package in recent week thank the minister very much for his answer be one of those to be sanction but what do that sanction mean it mean that my superyacht do not have one can not be take to vladivostok for the summer or for the winter so will have to take it to ballywalter the village where be bear and bring up and put it alongside the rent rowing boat that use now and again the sanction will not stop speak up to tell it straight on russia crime and let we remember what those be there be the steal child whom the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter talk about there be the thousand of man woman and child who have be murder and the church pastor who have disappear there be the massacre in bucha all those crime anger we this be about accountability it be about make sure that the russians who carry out those crime will be hold to account some day by the way hope they be watch because sanction do not stop and it will not stop anyone else in this chamber speak up either apologise for that introduction but as say early this week peace be the goal but not at any price what discussion have the minister have with the ukrainians to ensure they understand that our support be there until the right deal be in place what discussion have take place with our american ally to ensure that we be still on the same page when it come to make sure that russian aggression be not reward and that ukraine sacrifice be always remember think the hon gentleman comment like those of my hon friend accurately capture the sentiment of this house condemn the sanction against he but the reaction of he and other member of this house should show everybody in the world include vladimir putin but also our ally and most importantly ukraine that our support remain ironclad and undiminishe it will strengthen rather than diminish visit bucha just few week ago and as with colleague who have visit it those scene will never leave my mind let alone the horrific scene we have see over the last few week the fact that that place have suffer so much it be where priest be murder and child be abduct and just hour before be there further missile come in and kill civilian should leave nobody in any doubt whatsoever about who be the aggressor it be vladimir putin and his regime it be his war of aggression ukraine be the party that be serious about peace we will work with ukraine the united states and our european ally in the endeavour to find that peace but the ball be now very much in vladimir putin court london sudan conference urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make statement on the london sudan conference co host with the african union the eu france and germany the london sudan conference convene foreign ministers major donor and humanitarian leader to galvanise co ordinate international action on the conflict discussion focus on ensure humanitarian access protect civilian and support sudanese lead peace process that preserve sudan territorial integrity co chair statement set out the share principle of an immediate ceasefire rejection of external interference opposition to parallel government return to civilian lead transition and principled approach to full unimpeded humanitarian access although this be not pledge conference international partner do announce over million of support to address the humanitarian situation this include furth million in uk aid for this year which will reach over people with food nutrition support and emergency assistance include for survivor of sexual violence it follow our sustained push to ensure aid reach those in need include through access corridor such as the adré crossing from chad the uk will continue to lead international effort to end the conflict in sudan our immediate goal be clear to bring an end to this destructive war to protect civilian and to get aid to where it be need most our vision for sudan be to work with the sudanese people and international partner to deliver the democratic and peaceful future that they deserve thank mr speaker for grant this urgent question it be so important that we shine light on this conflict which be the bad humanitarian crisis in the world at this time sudan be experience the most extreme hunger crisis conflict relate famine mass displacement and extreme and sexual violence and killing continue to devastate million of people about half the million people be experience acute food insecurity with face catastrophic hunger the conflict have lead to an unprecedented displacement with million people internally displace since the start of the conflict and nearly million people force to flee across border unfortunately the crisis continue to get bad in recent day we have see the rapid support forces attack the zamzam camp which house about displaced people and the sudanese government allegedly attack market in western darfur which be speculate to be one of the bad single incident of the conflict share the minister aspiration as be sure do the whole house but we can not underestimate the scale of the challenge be pleased that the government take part in the conference but it be very disappointing that it be not possible to get the other participant particularly the arab nation to sign up to an agreement at the end of it it be also disappointing to find the rsf declare an alternative government within few day of the conference what be the government do to encourage great role for the african union particularly in discussion at the united nations generally there be view that if the african union be more involved it would be more difficult for russia to veto un resolution secondly what be we do in relation to the united arab emirates and its role in the conflict which have be significant this be truly tragic sequence of event for the people of sudan the right hon gentleman have long have an interest and he be right to call to the house to answer question we have hop that at the conference last week we would be able to issue communiqué agree by all party as he identify there be whole range of country with an interest in sudan we be at real risk at the moment not only of further degradation of the situation for those in zamzam northern darfur and across sudan but as he say of declaration of parallel government none of which will lead to the peaceful democratic future that the sudanese have long hop for the foreign secretary take the decision to try for this conference in an attempt to ensure wide agreement among the party because he recognise that there must be no hierarchy of conflict the situation in sudan be catastrophic and we be make every effort the conference be the beginning not the end of our effort to try to reduce the suffering in sudan call the shadow foreign secretary let begin by support the remark of my right hon friend the member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell and congratulate he on secure what be very important urgent question many million of innocent sudanese civilian have be catch up in what be barbaric conflict they deserve peace and dignity they be face the most appalling dire humanitarian crisis it be fact that red line have be cross in the conflict and that can not be allow to stand we all want to help chart course to meaningful peace for the people of sudan and we be aware of the various pillar articulate in the london sudan conference statement we all agree on the need for an immediate end to the fighting on prevent the partition of sudan and on the need for urgent humanitarian access crucially the foreign secretary conference do not see any new practical measure agree with the african union and other partner to help the war party into ceasefire and an end to the conflict and importantly to deter the way in which the conflict be be escalate because there have be no de escalation whatsoever support transition to civilian lead government be clearly crucial and it must be lead by the sudanese people what practical diplomacy be the foreign office and the foreign secretary do to help international process such as cairo to stay on track and to build confidence among the sudanese civilian and political force finally the minister mention the additional million in humanitarian aid announce by the government for will he inform we which organisation the foreign commonwealth and development office be partner with for the delivery of this new aid whether delivery have start and whether it be actually make any impact whatsoever will he also confirm that in parallel to announce this new aid he be work to keep border crossing open and press for the proper safety net to ensure that this aid end up with those who genuinely need it and not in the wrong hand like the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell the shadow foreign secretary raise important question about the african union we think it be particularly important that we co host this event with the african union clearly this be an important conflict with wide implication for those in the neighbourhood and in east africa we be take practical step and we conduct the conference in closed session in order to enable the kind of frank discussion that be require to advance towards more peaceful solution in sudan would not wish to give the house the impression that we have make dramatic progress towards an end to the violence in sudan we be all familiar with the terrible report that continue to come in even this morning of event in darfur and across sudan through the conference we be able to bring great unity among the international community on what the necessary next step must be and on the importance of maintain open border crossing which as the shadow foreign secretary set out be vital in addition to try to ensure that humanitarian access can be exercise right across sudan we have be in discussion with tom fletcher the emergency relief co ordinator who have today speak to some of the key participant in term of practical step can confirm that we remain in direct contact through our special envoy for sudan with both the rsf and the sudanese armed force we be absolutely clear that we need civilian process towards civilian government the government be right to co ordinate this conference as first step on the path to peace it be obviously disappointing that it be not possible to establish contact group at the end of the conference but know the minister will be work hard to progress bilateral talk not least with the external actor in this conflict such as the uae and egypt want to put the spotlight on woman and girl in this conflict who be experience high level of sexual violence what discussion be there on the protection of woman and girl and on the further step that could be take both to ensure the safety of those experience trauma today because of their experience and to protect woman and girl in the future my hon friend be absolutely right to put the focus on violence against woman and girl in sudan it be absolutely appalling the late report be lurid and graphic in their detail of what be befall woman and child right across sudan the minister for africa have be lead international effort to maintain spotlight on these question he chair un security council briefing on conflict relate sexual violence in sudan just last month and be also at the un security council in november far highlight this issue this conflict be disproportionately affect woman and child and the uk will remain completely focused on do everything we can to bring that to close call the liberal democrat spokesperson the sudan conference in london present an opportunity to generate international consensus for path to peace in sudan civil war the world large conflict it be deeply disappointing that the conference fail to establish contact group for the conflict as such group could build international political will to move towards an end to the fighting will the minister therefore outline what new diplomatic initiative he will pursue to establish contact group welcome the announcement of million more for humanitarian aid but with aid access be wield as weapon of war on both side can the minister assure we that it will reach civilian gender base violence be terrible feature of the war so what step can be take to protect woman and child be also deeply concern by report that other nation be supply arm to the war faction particularly the report that the united arab emirates have provide weapon to the rapid support forces which be allege to have commit mass civilian killing and be accuse by the us of genocide in darfur will the minister outline what step he have take to stop the flow of arm to ensure that british export be not use in sudan the shadow foreign secretary also raise those question be happy to write to the house with further detail about aid delivery both in relation to the million in further funding and the concern report over recent day about restriction in aid access particularly in darfur once the situation become clear be happy to provide full update to all party on the practical question about aid delivery the hon lady ask about the practical success of the conference and what be next on the diplomatic front the statement from the co chair which include not just the uk but the african union the eu and other attempt to capture what be an important and frank set of discussion over the course of the day and set out five principle it go far than any other recent statement call for ceasefire reject external interference oppose parallel governance and support transition to civilian lead government my foreign office official have be talk to all party with an interest in sudan include the two belligerent to make it clear that the statement be the strong view of the international community and that we expect to see it put in place it be true as the two most recent question have set out that we be not able to secure contact group at the conference would not want the house to think that as frank and behind closed door as it be the conference be therefore failure the fact that this be difficult be all the more reason why it be important for the uk to show leadership and to bring the african union and other to the table to discuss these issue what be happen in sudan should shock we all unicef have warn that child as young as one be be rap more than case of child rape have be report since so we need outrage and more importantly action can the minister confirm how much of our aid if any be be spend on support survivor of sexual abuse and violence and also how we be use our role as penholder on sudan at the un to push for action specifically on sexual violence my hon friend have work extensively on these issue and know her commitment to they will write to she with full breakdown on which part of our aid programme be work with survivor as set out in answer to an early question the minister for africa have lead effort at the security council on ensure that the whole international community be focus on the atrocity that she have just describe we be also lead effort at the human rights council to establish and renew the mandate for the un fact find mission which will be crucial to support future accountability effort in sudan appreciate the pressure on the minister official but do the minister agree that this disaster play out in sudan be under report and therefore may encourage he in the future to take every opportunity to come to the house voluntarily with statement rather than rely on urgent question to give he the opportunity which he have quite rightly take today to spell out where we be in this awful situation be always happy to come to the house but let just clarify that be not the minister with policy responsibility for sudan that belong to the minister for africa in the lords since take office the foreign secretary have show strong personal commitment to this conflict he be intensely aware of the many conflict in the world but appreciate that this be the one that be cause the great humanitarian disaster there be danger of appear to create hierarchy of conflict and the foreign secretary be personally commit to ensure that that be not the case and that be why he take the leadership that he do last week sudan be the world big humanitarian crisis and we know that there have be particular toll on woman and girl as other member have mention some of hospital in conflict affect area be not function and maternal death have spike so can the minister say little bit more about how aid will support hospital in the region thank my hon friend for her important question as have say in previous answer we be very focused on the fate of woman and girl in sudan we have be work through the united nations and with the emergency relief co ordinator to ensure that the necessary aid be in place whether that be for the function of hospital to support survivor or to protect the mechanism to prevent civilian suffering will update the house once the position be clear give the event of the last few day congratulate the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell on secure this urgent question and lay out the unimaginable horror of what be currently happen in sudan there be very real danger that the catastrophe in sudan will spread to neighbouring country since an estimate sudanese refugee have flee to chad which be already one of the poor country in the world and rank no in the list of country at risk of genocide what assessment have be make of the impact of overseas aid cut to the likelihood of genocide occur in chad and what be the government do proactively to prevent genocide in chad the hon gentleman ask an important question since the conflict begin million refugee have flee to neighbouring country that of course include chad but also egypt south sudan uganda and the central african republic many of these country know well and serve in south sudan for the department for international development for two year these be country with delicate political balance and that have see recent incidence of severe conflict what happen in sudan make difference to neighbouring country do not think that what be centrally at issue here be uk aid to chad what be centrally at issue be violent displacement from sudan and we will remain focused on those question commend the foreign secretary for co host the conference and for give this situation the political and diplomatic attention that it warrant the crisis in sudan be awful the un have warn that never in modern history have so many people face starvation and famine as in sudan today the un put that down to the deliberate starvation tactic by the rsf and the saf can the minister outline what further measure the government be take to end the deliberate obstruction of food aid by the war party the uk condemn the grow body of evidence of serious atrocity be commit against civilian in sudan the escalation of violence kill of civilian sexual assault of woman and restriction of humanitarian access must end that be why in january the foreign secretary visit the sudan chad border and raise awareness of the conflict it be why we host the conference last week and be in regular touch with both the party themselves and all those with influence include regional player the united nations and major donor we be try to do everything we can to ensure that humanitarian access be properly restore might it be expedient if we use our intelligence resource to expose and shame those who be fuel the conflict through arm the antagonist we be clear that there should be no external interference in sudan and that continuation of this conflict serve no one it be why we take the effort last week that we do and we hold the conference in closed door session in order to allow the frank possible exchange of view on the way ahead the scene from sudan be beyond harrowing there be brutal murder million at risk of starvation and million more have be displace with woman and child watch their son father and husband be brutally kill and many of those woman and child be victim of the most horrendous sexual violence in newcastle under lyme represent number of people from the sudanese community either bear in sudan or whose parent be bear in sudan they be watch the tv in horror fear and sorrow what we be do to engage with and support the british sudanese community here in the united kingdom my hon friend speak about the horror for british sudanese resident who be look back at home and see such atrocious scene be sure that the minister for africa will be happy to meet with my hon friend and his constituent to discuss the issue far have sudanese constituent in lincoln and know the horror that they feel each and every day look at this imagery do the minister agree that religious freedom must remain key pillar of the uk foreign aid policy that say with sudan now rank as one of the bad country in the world for christian persecution accord to open doors will he confirm whether the protection of religious minority will be condition indeed priority of the distribution of foreign aid to sudan freedom of religious belief remain real priority for the government on my way to the house be with our new envoy for freedom of religious belief meet with the community who have suffer in yemen and iran this remain an important question for the government and we will remain focused on it through the envoy the minister rightly condemn the violence against woman and girl in sudan will he update the house specifically on what assistance be be provide to the victim of female genital mutilation those woman be literally castrate will he ensure that we be provide assistance to those poor woman have hear the house interest in the fine detail of which element of our aid programme be work with survivor and commit to provide that further information in due course be deeply concerned by the ongoing conflict in sudan and in particular the sexual violence that be bring to light so shockingly by the hon member for norwich north alice macdonald when the minister next engage with his counterpart in south sudan will he raise the case of dr ding col dau ding he travel from norfolk to south sudan to practise medicine shortly after independence and save many life across east africa in his time there just year later he be shockingly murder and his family my constituent have be fight for justice for almost decade will he meet and the family of dr ding to discuss how they can finally secure justice for their beloved brother and son be not familiar with the case will discuss it with the minister for africa and ensure that the hon member get proper response thank the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell for secure the urgent question despite the barbarity of sudan it seem to be the forget conflict what step be be take to investigate and prevent the transfer of arm to sudan via third country who may have be present at the conference over the weekend and be ally of the uk we be clear in the co chair statement as we have be in many other place that we do not want external interference in this conflict we be take every step we can to try to ensure that we get back to diplomatic solution and back to civilian transfer towards civilian rule which be what the sudanese so desperately need the minister clearly understand the issue and respond to our question so we thank he for that have like other raise the sudanese war on numerous occasion and the act of depravity and war crime that have take place over the last number of year and many other be dishearten to see the end to any semblance of peace talk however we must not lose heart and give up the people of sudan deserve well chance of hope and future without live in fear how will the minister facilitate further peace talk what discussion have take place with ally to produce co ordinate global effort to stop the torture the maiming and the killing and to bring peace to all say with regret that the two protagonist of the conflict do not appear prepared to enter into serious talk at the moment that be why they be not invite to the conference the conference be not an attempt to mediate peace deal as that be not possible if neither participant be prepared to do so we make the judgment that the conference be so important to try to cohere international support towards the next step to try to reduce the violence we be work with all our partner to try to do that business of the house will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business the business for the week commence april include monday april second reading of the football governance bill lords tuesday april remain stage of the public

local election come up very much hope that you madam deputy speaker and everyone here have perfectly spectacular easter be sure speak for the whole house in record my sadness at the death of his holiness the pope who be in his work and in his life the embodiment of faith hope and charity if may would like to start with something small but important my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans recently ask the secretary of state for education in write parliamentary question whether she have visit any private school since july last year the junior education minister the hon member for portsmouth south stephen morgan reply that the secretary of state for education and the wide ministerial team visit wide variety of education setting include private school the secretary of state for education prioritise visit to our state school which serve of pupil in england all that be no doubt true but it be not an answer to the question that be put all ministerial visit be log by the department so it would have be and remain easy to compile the number the leader of the house have make clear on many occasion her commitment and belief that member of this house should receive proper answer to their question will she take up the matter with the secretary of state for education and see that proper answer be give few week ago talk about how the prime minister be steadily be mug by reality and we have see this again in the last few day with the government turn on the ban on source photovoltaic cell build with slave labour in china the same can be say for the government energy policy as whole it be important to put before the house the fact that labour manifesto promise to cut bill boost energy security and create cheap zero carbon electricity by accelerate to net zero by it try to allay public concern by promise phased and responsible transition in the north sea that recognise the ongoing role of oil and gas in our energy mix nine month on we can see how that be go the government have already have to turn on their infeasible commitment to zero carbon electricity by most recently the situation with british steel in scunthorpe have underline the deep incoherence of their overall approach by ban new oil and gas licence and prevent new exploration the government be commit the uk to great dependency on import oil and gas at high cost with high emission and under less democratic control in so do they be not advance environmental justice or economic resilience they be accelerate decline in energy sovereignty that will leave this country more polluting less secure and ultimately poor if we do not produce our own oil and gas we will have to buy it the difference be that it will come from overseas and import energy be not only more expensive but have far high carbon footprint remind the house that for example import liquefy natural gas involve cool gas to below zero ship it thousand of mile from qatar and regasifye it at port in this country the net emission be up to four time high than those from north sea gas crucially uk territorial emission go down but overall emission include import be high than they would be this be not an honest policy labour manifesto talk about the importance of energy security but refuse to allow new exploration do not reduce our vulnerability it increase it energy after all be national security it be industrial strategy it be heat our house and fuel our car the idea that major economy should voluntarily give up control of its energy supply before alternative be well advanced be not progressive it be reckless the problem go somewhat wide the government talk about green industrial revolution but the more expensive import energy we have the hard that will be to achieve not just steel but chemical ceramic and fertiliser all require large amount of gas and will do for year to come if energy be unreliable or unaffordable those industry will continue to struggle whatever the fond imagining of the secretary of state worse still the government policy will squander capital and skill that might have go into safely manage the uk remain hydrocarbon asset the extra revenue that would have help fund the transition will now be lose to the many other country that welcome such investment while the government turn their back on sector that still employ people and contribute billion in tax revenue ask the leader of the house whether she share my view that we badly need some common sense here we all want an effective and just energy transition but that start with one principle control what we can and use our own resource responsibly and transparently while build the clean energy system of the future instead the government have choose path that will increase emission raise cost weaken the economy and tie britain future to foreign power and volatile market that be not leadership that be an abdication be sure the thought of the whole house will be with catholics in this country and around the world as they grieve pope francis as the shadow leader of the house say pope francis embody the very good of we with his deep faith and commitment to the poor the weak and those deal with conflict and destitution once again put on the record my thank to you madam deputy speaker to mr speaker and to all the house staff for the professional and speedy way they recall parliament for we over the easter recess they have dedication and professionalism at their core take this opportunity which do not think have be do yet in the house to pay tribute to rory mcilroy on finally get one of the great sporting achievement the golf grand slam and be the first european to do so the resilience and mental strength he show be unbelievable and he be role model of great sportsmanship also wish good luck to all those take part in the london marathon this weekend the shadow leader of the house raise number of point about the government energy and climate change strategy but he misunderstand the economic of the situation the way we will get energy security and low bill in the future and over the long term be by have our own energy security and our own clean energy supply we have to get ourselves off fossil fuel because to get that energy security we have to become price maker not price taker home grow energy be the only way we will get control over our price and get off the fossil fuel roller coaster as country we have great asset we be an island nation with an ability to generate offshore and onshore wind tidal and nuclear energy this government have waste no time we have lift the ban on onshore wind we have establish great british energy we have approve nearly of solar deliver record break renewable auction kick start carbon capture and get the nuclear planning reform under way that be how this country will bring down energy bill and get the energy security we need we have to get ourselves off the fossil fuel rollercoaster the shadow leader of the house need to look at the economic of the situation notice that the chamber be very busy today unlike many member as we look forward to the local election the shadow leader of the house do not want to use this opportunity to make his party pitch for the forthcoming local election perhaps because the conservatives be not quite sure what their pitch be people have not forget the chaos and decline that his party leave this country in after year of failure and sleaze the labour party be put money in people pocket with our boost to the living wage with wage rise fast than price we be fix the nhs with waiting list down for six month in row and cut by since july our new free breakfast club will give kid the start to life that they need we be take back control of our train and bus and as see at the weekend we be take swift action to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour by seize and crush off road bike which do myself that be the difference that labour make in power be still not quite sure what the conservative party strategy be at the election perhaps the shadow leader of the house would like to enlighten we be it what have be propose by the shadow justice secretary the right hon member for newark robert jenrick in the form of an alliance with reform if that be not their strategy why have he not be sack the leader of the opposition use her flagship election interview on the today programme this week to tell we of her one big achievement tory party unity nearly spit out my tea tory members can barely muster cheer for she at prime minister question and the shadow justice secretary be in open leadership campaign mode in fact this week have see letter that the shadow justice secretary send to all conservative local election candidate with his clear leadership pitch and the offer of lunch with robert by the way it be all on house of commons head paper madam deputy speaker which be highly questionable it be blatant manoeuvring and strong leader would have sack he by now be it not the truth that at the election next week vote for the conservatives be vote for reform and vote for reform be vote for the conservatives we have be deal this week with the sad passing of pope francis be also deeply sadden by the shocking cowardly and deadly terrorist attack on innocent tourist in jammu and kashmir the victim and their family be very much in my prayer sincerely hope that the perpetrator be swiftly bring to justice will my right hon friend the leader of the house take this opportunity to convey this parliament heartfelt condolence to the indian people and to condemn that callous attack that horrific terrorist attack in kashmir be utterly devastating and as my hon friend say cowardly act my thought and those of the whole government be with the affected especially those who have lose love one last week my hon friend the member for bath wera hobhouse be deny entry to hong kong while make private trip to see her son and meet her three month old grandson for the very first time she be give no reason by the local authority as to why she be refuse so it seem reasonable to assume that her only crime be be british parliamentarian she tell that go all that way only to be bundle on to the next flight home with no explanation be big shock and that she be close to tear her son be wait for she and her husband just short distance away in the arrival lounge but she never see he this be extremely worrying and have far reach and concern implication to be clear my hon friend have not be make aware that she would not be welcome in hong kong and it be purely private visit the liberal democrats be concerned that this could have chilling effect on all parliamentarian who speak up for freedom and democracy we can not and must not accept our democracy be undermine by allow the intimidation of uk parliamentarian will the leader of the house ask the foreign secretary to make statement on how the government intend to engage in clear eyed manner with authoritarian country that appear to be create hidden blacklist of british parliamentarian thank the hon member for raise this matter on the floor of the house because know that it be of deep concern to all members know the hon member for bath well have know she for number of year and enjoy our exchange when she be the hon lady predecessor and be shock and deeply sadden to hear of this incident she must be so upset not to have have the opportunity to meet her grandson have be deny entry to hong kong in this way the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman be right to say that it be unacceptable for member of parliament to be deny entry to another country simply for be member of parliament albeit on private visit in this case the government have relay our deep concern over this incident to the hong kong and chinese authority and we will continue to press these issue with they over the come month she be right to say that our democracy and our ability as member of parliament to speak freely in this place and to not have that jeopardise when we travel abroad be fundamental to what the house of commons be all about recently visit great regional organisation north east youth in my constituency and meet member of the peer action collective an inspire group of young people work to prevent violence within the education system lucy penny and dan deliver compelling presentation on the need for clear communication and well listen to young people in school can we have debate in government time on how we can implement more effective way of understand the cause of youth violence and disruptive behaviour and support young people before an escalation to violence join my hon friend in congratulate lucy penny and dan and all those involve in the peer action collective which sound like very good initiative the government take youth violence incredibly seriously we have establish the young futures programme and we want to bring all those partner together

pahalgam in india the sad reality be that the terrorist group think to be responsible for this lashkar taiba be pakistani organisation that deliberately target innocent people in jammu and kashmir already the indian government have revoke visa close the border and expel official from pakistan as result probably most importantly they have suspend the indus water treaty we need the foreign

guidance require under subsection the treasury shall consider the feasibility of select purchaser from the mutual sector as means of avoid demutualisation provide such purchaser meet the resolution objective this amendment seek to ensure that where possible the selection of purchaser from the mutual sector be consider to avoid demutualisation provide this align with the bank resolution objective before speak to new clause specifically let reiterate that the opposition welcome the government decision to carry over the legislation from the previous parliament and that the principle underpin the bill continue to enjoy strong cross party support we all want and need confidence in our banking sector yet the failure of silicon valley bank uk expose gap in our resolution framework for small bank unlike large institution they do not hold the bail and bond mechanism know as mrel the minimum requirement for own fund and eligible liability reserve to facilitate recapitalisation in the event of crisis by provide the bank of england with new tool to manage small bank failure the bill remain both prudent and necessary to protect financial stability and public fund move on to the amendment we have table on report want to make it clear that our approach be constructive and focus on strengthen the bill not obstruct its progress as the bill have make progress through both houses our intention have be to address series of small but none the less significant issue that we believe require further attention appreciate that this might be conversation we can continue in today debate or beyond it and would certainly welcome conversation with the minister who have be incredibly open to direct conversation in her usual pragmatic style to far discuss these matter we have three measure select for discussion today will speak first to new clause which address critical gap in the bill scope the protection of credit union these community focus institution have see significant growth in recent year drive in part by the eradication of predatory payday lender and they continue to provide vital role in deliver affordable finance to those underserve by traditional bank membership of credit union rise from million in to million in an increase of more than however while their importance have grow their inclusion in our resolution framework have not keep pace the financial services compensation scheme have pay million in compensation to credit union depositor over the past three financial year primarily due to small scale failure underscore their potential vulnerability and the need for tailor approach as the sector expand the growth of credit union be success story but it demand proportional safeguard the bill however exclude credit union from its recapitalisation mechanism while their small size and unique nature may differentiate they from bank question remain how do the current resolution regime account for credit union failure as the sector scale up be there scope to develop mechanism that protect member without impose undue burden on these community institution new clause seek clarity on this matter require the minister to produce report outline how the resolution framework can be adapt to protect credit union ensure that their growth do not outstrip their regulatory safeguard the vast amount of legislation for credit union be write back in the the previous government make significant reform for credit union through amendment to the financial services and markets act and welcome the common bond reform consultation which close last month know that the government be give the sector serious consideration and be sure the minister will agree that this be not about apply bank style rule to mutual but about recognise their unique role and risk credit union be more than financial institution they be engine of financial inclusion they often serve small working class community whom know the government want to support specifically as the sector evolve so too must our approach we must ensure that our regulatory framework grow hope the government will support this amendment which simply seek to look more clearly at the option available when crisis happen amendment seek to address concern that have be raise with by the mutual and build society sector these institution be not relic of the past but vital component of our financial ecosystem although the first know building society be set up in by ordinary work people help themselves to build their financial resilience and get home of their own they remain current today building society today hold more than billion in asset and provide mortgage for more than million people in the uk they represent significant proportion of the housing market and be trusted source of saving for million more they provide clear and important diversification in our financial market offer clear alternative to shareholder bank the labour party stand on clear manifesto commitment to double the size of the co operative and mutual sector which the opposition agree be very good policy today present good opportunity for labour members to demonstrate that commitment to the sector by enshrine in the bill requirement that the bank of england consider the risk of demutualisation when use the mechanism enshrine therein there be genuine fear in the building society sector that without proper safeguard the recapitalisation mechanism offer by the bill could inadvertently become back door for demutualisation when mutual institution face resolution the selection of purchaser from the plc sector risk permanently dismantle its mutual status undermine the very ethos that make these institution unique our amendment would provide proportionate solution require the bank of england to consider the impact of demutualisation on member and the sector as whole while also explore the feasibility of select mutual sector purchaser if one exist and meet the resolution objective this be not about privilege mutual at the expense of financial stability it be about ensure that the bank resolution tool do not inadvertently homogenise our financial landscape silicon valley bank demonstrate the need for agile resolution framework but it also highlight the importance of preserve institutional diversity mutual and building society often serve community and demographic that large bank frequently overlook their potential loss would leave gap in financial inclusion and weaken the resilience of the sector importantly without the million of mortgage provide by the building society sector particularly for first time homeowner labour house building plan would be simply impossible hope the minister appreciate that our amendment strike careful balance between safeguard financial stability and honour our commitment to pluralistic banking system one where mutual continue to thrive as cornerstone of community focus finance remind labour members that it will be much hard to double the size of the mutual sector if in the event of failure recapitalisation default towards the banking sector hope the government will therefore demonstrate their manifesto commitment to the mutual and co operative sector by vote today for new clause and amendment there remain genuine concern share across this house and reflect in the debate in the other place over the risk of the recapitalisation mechanism be apply too broadly and potentially capture large bank that already hold substantial loss absorb resource such as mrel we continue to believe that the mechanism should be limit in scope and target at small bank that do not have the same capacity to manage their own failure amendment would limit the use of the mechanism to what it be always intend to be mechanism for small bank outside the mrel regime appreciate that new clause and have already be rule out of scope but it may be worth note couple of point on these measure wish to place on the record today that the opposition believe the time have come for review of how we set the threshold for mrel as well as the protection ceiling for depositor under the financial services compensation scheme the current static nature of mrel threshold disproportionately affect small and mid sized bank particularly challenger bank by index mrel threshold to inflation we can ensure that the regulatory framework remain robust over time without stifle competition these institution often operate on tight margin and face significant barrier in meet rigid capital requirement hinder their ability to scale and compete effectively with large incumbent while we appreciate that the bank of england consultation on mrel close early this year we hope that the government will consider these point threshold limit should not stay static with time likewise we welcome the government recognition of the need to review the financial services compensation scheme deposit limit the recent announcement of the increase of the deposit protection scheme from to although very welcome be certainly overdue it be worth note that if the limit have keep pace with inflation it would be nearly two third high at around accord to the federation of small businesses it be worth note that only of silicon valley bank uk deposit be insure by the financial services compensation scheme order may just remind the hon gentleman that we be discuss what be in scope rather than what be not in scope and have not be select my apology madam deputy speaker these be point that we feel be worth note but take your comment will turn to amendment table by the liberal democrats although we share the intent behind the amendment which mirror the conservatives amendment on mrel limit for bank there be critical difference in its approach that give we pause like we the liberal democrats recognise that end state mrel bank should not be the primary target of this legislation however their amendment introduce requirement for statutory instrument under the negative procedure that we believe would create more problem than it solve our concern lie in the potential impracticality of this approach banking crisis can unfold rapidly as we see with silicon valley bank uk where decision be make in matter of hour not day statutory instrument subject to the negative procedure become law the moment the minister sign it which be good thing and it remain in law unless either house reject it within sitting day that create window of uncertainty if member be to pray against the statutory instrument particularly in hung parliament it could trigger market instability which be precisely what this bill seek to avoid so although we agree with the principle of limit the bill scope we worry that the mechanism could tie the hand of future chancellor hinder their ability to respond swiftly and decisively in crisis for those reason we can not support the liberal democrat amendment finally turn to the liberal democrat growth amendment amendment here we find ourselves in familiar and supportive position this amendment which seek to place further objective on the bank of england to consider the competitiveness and growth of the market before direct the recapitalisation of fail small bank through levy on the banking sector echo concern raise in the house of lords we be happy to support the proposal there and in committee the government frequently repeat the point that their focus be on economic growth that be goal that all of we in this house share the decision to place levy on the banking sector to cover the cost of competitor failure must be carefully weigh against the broad growth objective this be an economic climate in which taxis and borrowing be up and business confidence job and growth be down but the government have an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to economic growth through this legislation and we of course hope that they will in conclusion we support the overall aim of the bill it will strengthen our banking system and our banking resolution framework as say the bill be originally draft by the previous government and retain cross party support we have highlight several key area that require further consideration and hope the minister will consider they from ensure that the mechanism be not extend to mrel bank to protect mutual society and credit union and safeguard the financial services compensation scheme against inflation our amendment aim to improve the bill effectiveness and fairness which be entirely in line with the promise make by the labour party before the general election very much look forward to labour support its own manifesto promise rise to speak in opposition to amendment and under the previous government the country be subject to year of economic chaos this government have make restore stability cornerstone of our strategy to boost long term growth ensure macroprudential stability underpin by an effective recovery and resolution regime be key part of that change undertake in the uk and globally through the basel iii reform have make our large bank safe and more resilient and we should welcome that the reform have improve solvency and reduce risk for the taxpayer however the collapse of silicon valley bank in have demonstrate the need for new tool to help minimise the risk to consumer taxpayer and broad financial stability pose by small bank failure we need an approach that go beyond the bank insolvency procedure and that be why the proposal in the bill enjoy so much support across our financial service sector as know from my role as chair of the all party parliamentary group on financial market and service but in design this new approach we must make sure that the proposal reflect the lesson of experience in all candour be concerned that the amendment do not do that and will impede the functioning of the new regime render it less effective at moment of crisis be an adviser in the treasury to alistair darling during the global financial crisis when we have to resolve and recapitalise number of major bank the action that the labour government take then often in the face of resistance from conservative members help to save our financial sector from catastrophe and stabilise not just the uk but the global economy there be many lesson to be learn from that period but in relation to the bill one stand out when we have to act to save our banking sector we learn that successful resolution rely among other thing on two key factor speed and flexibility it be the combination of those factor that be so important in and since then would argue they have only become more important in we watch bank liquidity and solvency deteriorate by the day but now as the collapse of signature bank in the us in show the combination of banking app and social medium mean that full scale banking run can develop in hour or even minute if we be to resolve bank successfully regulator must be able to move as quickly speed have become more important than ever so too have flexibility as we see increase financial innovation and diversification among bank with new challenger new form of institution and new type of market and asset emerge allow regulator sufficient flexibility have become more essential not less the value of flexibility be demonstrate in the case of silicon valley bank uk subsidiary the creative use of power to resolve that bank through sale rather than put it into the bank insolvency procedure protect consumer minimise market turbulence and shield the public purse contrast that with the us regulator approach to the parent company svb there rigidity and mechanistic failure to apply major bank rule lead to failure of regulatory oversight that contribute as us regulator have acknowledge to the bank failure raise this matter because fear that amendment and will militate against speed and flexibility and will reduce the effectiveness of the bill especially in acute crisis situation let start with propose amendment this would require the bank of england to consider competitiveness and the growth impact on the market before direct resolution through the fscs however well intentione the amendment be it could have catastrophic effect at time of crisis policymaker have sometimes just hour to act it would place duty on they to make market assessment which by the way could presumably be challenge this be simply impractical and could fatally slow down action to restore financial stability as someone who have sit in the room during bail out process have to tell the proposer of the amendment that spend time on this kind of exercise during disorderly bank failure be simply luxury that we do not have be also concerned that such requirement would have chilling effect stay regulator hand when they have to act quickly this could not only increase the risk of disorderly collapse but raise the cost to the fscs of recapitalisation if it do proceed experience tell we that the long we put off resolution the more expensive it become this be recipe for high risk and high cost moreover leave aside the practical difficulty the underlying logic be flawed first in seek to analyse the market before decide on whether to resolve an institution or wind it up we be put the cart before the horse surely much well course of action be to prevent the potentially disorderly collapse of the institution and then to work out its long term future and the role if any it should play in the market secondly the amendment fail to take into account other objective that the prudential regulation authority should properly consider in decide whether to act include the protection of retail saver the prevention of contagion and the safeguarding of macroprudential stability as draft the amendment however well intentione could distort pra decision making its intention may be good but its impact might not be the same be unfortunately true of amendment and both seek to circumscribe the use of the fscs via statute to prevent it be use to bail out large institution the amendment would rob regulator of the flexibility to use the instrument in unusual or unforeseen circumstance in the name of solve problem that do not exist the power provide by the bill be already aim squarely at small bank and there be various safeguard in the bill to prevent the use of those power for large bank in most scenario for example the bill state that the fscs fund resolution may be use only for institution that be place in bridge bank or transfer to new institution and this would not be applicable for large bank in most scenario as they be expect to be resolve through an mrel bail in the bill also provide for de facto treasury sign off require the chancellor to report to parliament on the use of the power and mandate the bank to inform the chairs of the relevant parliamentary committees whenever an fscs fund resolution be undertake as such it be already well policed and circumscribe there be little danger of this approach be regularly or routinely use with large bank add statutory prohibition on use this approach with firm meet their minimum mrel threshold would add little but it would create risk my experience in the treasury during the global financial crisis and in my work across financial service since then be that we can not say that the highly improbable will never happen and we can not always predict what form the next crisis will take or what will trigger it conservative members should surely understand this lesson well than most after all it be liz truss disastrous mini budget that spark market chaos through product liability drive investment that most people have never even hear of and be think to be very stable and low risk give this it would be exceptionally unwise to statutorily bar the bank from be able to use all the tool at its disposal in exceptional circumstance there be eventuality that however unlikely be possible such as well capitalise bank suffer very rapid deterioration of its position due to mass redress event we must allow the bank flexibility to access the tool that the bill provide in exceptional circumstance in order to ensure stability and protect the taxpayer we must not bind its hand in crisis the power of the government proposal lie in their ability to be deploy rapidly and with flexibility that be what will give they their traction and help safeguard our financial stability it be critical that we preserve those facet of the bill for that reason urge the house to join in reject the amendment the liberal democrats be supportive of the bill because the last thing taxpayer need to worry about be the consequence of an under regulate banking sector have bring amendment back from committee because the size of bank eligible for the new mechanism have be key debate through the bill passage the minister have regularly set out that the bill state aim be to enhance the resolution regime so that we can respond to the failure of small bank however the bill do not restrict the regime to small or medium sized bank if apply to large bank it would create high cost for bank and customer the cost would persist for many year add significant long term burden on the banking sector and consumer amendment would ensure that the bill do not apply to bank that have reach the end state minimum requirement for own fund and eligible liability put more simply the large uk bank that would mean that only small and medium sized bank could be support by the mechanism that would protect consumer and the banking sector from unnecessary financial burden amendment have also be bring back from committee it would place further objective on the bank of england to consider the competitiveness and growth of the market before direct the recapitalisation of fail small bank through levy on the banking sector we believe that further consideration of the effect on the competitiveness and growth of the market be important before direct the recapitalisation of fail small bank to conclude would be grateful if the minister could expand on the remark make in committee and explain how precisely the amendment would complicate the process of manage bank failure it be always pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mrs cummins thank the hon member for wyre forest mark garnier and for wokingham clive jones for their amendment and their constructive engagement throughout the bill passage the bill will ensure that the bank of england remain equip with the necessary tool to effectively manage bank failure in way that minimise risk to the taxpayer and to uk financial stability protect the taxpayer while there may be some disagreement on the fine detail of the bill what we have hear today and on second reading and in committee demonstrate that there be cross party support for the principle and overall objective of the bill thank the hon member for wyre forest and the hon member for wokingham for support those the amendment cover broad range of issue and will explain the government position on they in turn but first thank my hon friend the member for hendon david pinto duschinsky for set out his experience of the banking crisis and stress that the mechanism we be seek to provide through the bill must allow the bank of england in close consultation with the treasury and other financial service regulator to act with speed and flexibility at time of crisis there be hour not day in which to make decision during crisis and at the forefront of our mind when discuss the bill should be that they often happen over the weekend as happen under the previous government with silicon valley bank will turn to that example shortly but want to thank my hon friend the member for hendon for set out his concern about the amendment that would essentially stymie the effectiveness of the bill note that the shadow minister the hon member for wyre forest raise number of issue on new clause on the bill impact on credit union some be not strictly relevant to the bill but will come on to they as he note the government absolutely support credit union they play vital role in provide save product and affordable credit in local community across the country however they be not in scope of the resolution regime that we be discuss and therefore not in scope of the new recapitalisation payment mechanism introduce by the bill that be benefit to the credit union sector indeed it ask the government to ensure that it be not include in the payment mechanism credit union will therefore not be liable to pay towards the cost of failure where the mechanism be use will set out the detail of the resolution regime and remind the shadow minister and other why credit union be not involve in this case under the resolution regime the bank of england have set of power it can use to manage the failure of banking institution in order to protect financial stability and public fund in order for the bank of england to use these power certain condition must be meet include that resolution action be necessary and in the public interest it be unlikely that these condition would be meet in the case of credit union failure give their size and the reduced likelihood of contagion if they fail it be therefore appropriate and proportionate that these firm be out of scope of the resolution regime and place into insolvency when they fail instead the government do not therefore believe that it be necessary for report to be produce on the impact of the bill on credit union nevertheless appreciate the point the shadow minister raise about access to liquidity facility credit union be not currently eligible to access the bank of england liquidity facility but the bank do continually assess the type of firm that be eligible would gently say to he that with eligibility to these liquidity facility come additional responsibility on behalf of the firm that benefit from they that be worth bear in mind reiterate the government clear strong support for the credit union sector we continue to engage regularly with the sector to understand the barrier it face to be able to grow and compete support wholeheartedly what the minister have say about credit union because credit union have big role to play in northern ireland as they do in other part of the united kingdom my concern when it come to crisis in bank be that credit union belong to their member but bank have different hierarchy they have chief executive and director to pay believe it be unfair for banker to retain their bonus while the pensioner who have save his penny all his life suffer no matter what the crisis be the executive still get their dividend and bonus have simple question within this legislation and the rule we have here can we be assure that the banker the one at the top who may be responsible for the bank or certainly act responsible for they will find that their bonus be not deliver to they the hon gentleman draw on something that be not pertinent to the amendment but understand why he have ask the question when bank fail there be hierarchy of creditor can write to he with that hierarchy as do not have it in my head at the moment the hierarchy ensure that if for example the bank be bail in those who have already invest in the bank become stakeholder although it depend on the resolution scenario and where they be in that process the people who have deposit in the bank in more simple language people who have bank account be protect up to soon that will increase in the way that the shadow minister suggest amendment and in the name of shadow minister the hon member for wyre forest and the hon member for wokingham respectively both relate to the scope of the bill which have be discuss at length during the bill passage through this house and in the other place the government position remain that the mechanism in the bill be not intend to support the resolution of the large bank the hon member for wyre forest set that out in his speech as do the hon member for wokingham the large bank will continue to be require to hold mrel to self insure against their own failure for bank that be require to hold mrel the bank of england should in the first instance use those resource to recapitalise such firm in resolution rather than resort to the new mechanism in the bill it be right that shareholder and investor in the firm should bear loss before anyone else which go to the point make by the hon member for strangford jim shannon return to the primary purpose of the bill which be to protect the taxpayer bank failure be by their nature highly unpredictable as my hon friend the member for hendon say in the unlikely circumstance where top up be need to resolve bank once all its mrel resource have be use hon member must consider whether they want those cost to be bear by the taxpayer it be the government belief that the taxpayer should not be on the hook for those cost make the point in committee and do so again today that safeguard be in place to prevent inappropriate use of the mechanism the treasury for example be involve in the exercise of any resolution power through be consult about whether condition for resolution have be meet it would also need to approve any resolution action with implication for public fund if the bank of england request large sum from the financial services compensation scheme that the scheme could not provide through its own resource additional amount would need to be borrow from the treasury and would therefore require the treasury approval therefore in practice treasury consent would be require if the bank of england have request large sum the shadow minister attempt to draw into many different subject relate to mrel you rightly remind he madam deputy speaker of the scope of the bill and the amendment under discussion will always be happy to have those discussion with he as he know the bank of england recently consult on the threshold and note what he say before he be call to order he also try to draw into question about the financial services compensation scheme which be also for different day as he say there will soon be increase appreciate that the bill scope be limited and the minister be make an excellent case for the government realise that bank collapse be unusual and that the government take range of step to try to protect the interest of consumer but could she write to reassure on the related point of bank branch there be bank collapse perhaps my hon friend and could have discussion outside the chamber so that can well understand his question the mechanism in the bill be about what happen when the resolution regime be trigger four different condition have to be meet for that to happen the bill seek to continue the work that the opposition start to take forward when they be in government before the election about what we do in case like that of silicon valley bank in that case there be not any recourse to public fund but this be about how we protect the taxpayer in scenario where there be perhaps we can have discussion about bank branch closure which be obviously of great concern to member across the house appreciate that amendment table by the hon member for wokingham aim to introduce an additional safeguard by permit the bank of england to use its new power on the large bank only if the treasury permit that through regulation he talk about that in his speech however there may be risk associate with that approach particularly if the bank of england need to take decision at pace in crisis indeed my hon friend the member for hendon be in the treasury when many such situation arise interruption well let we not rake over the history we discuss some of these issue in committee as the shadow minister suggest we be try to avoid window of uncertainty during which statutory instrument would be lay the bank of england work in close partnership and consultation with the treasury and the other financial service regulator need to be able to act swiftly and decisively often over the weekend ask hon member and the hon member for wokingham in particular to cast our mind back to the weekend when silicon valley bank uk be fail the bill derive from the lesson learn from that event what we see from that incident be how quickly the authority the bank of england in consultation with the treasury the pra and the fca must move to find solution before market open and resolve fail firm in way that protect financial stability depositor and the taxpayer that have to be at the forefront of our mind when we be think about the amendment amendment could add further stage to that process whereby the treasury must lay regulation to enable the bank of england to act that may well it be most likely that it would hamper those effort to implement solution swiftly to achieve those objective have silicon valley bank uk be catch by such requirement that certainly would have make achieve the solution by monday morning before the market open much more challenging again the priority be to protect the depositor and to protect financial stability overall the government firmly believe that it be well to leave flexibility for the bank note the safeguard in place that have already mention on the basis of those point hope that hon member will be persuade to support the government position on this matter know that it be an issue of some contention amendment also in the name of the hon member for wokingham be on whether the bank of england should have growth and competitiveness objective when exercise its new power another topic that we have discuss previously during the bill passage growth and competitiveness be fundamental priority for the government and as state in committee disorderly bank failure could pose serious risk to the growth and competitiveness of the sector and to the uk economy the bill seek to mitigate that risk bear that in mind the government do not believe that they should impose requirement on the bank of england to consider growth and competitiveness when it be take urgent crisis management action in relation to an individual distressed or fail firm at such time the situation that it would have to manage would be challenge enough without an additional broad objective of that kind the resolution objective set out in the banking act already provide solid basis on which it must make its decision include protect financial stability protect cover depositor and protect the taxpayer as my hon friend the member for hendon remind we the bank of england in close partnership with the treasury and the other financial service regulator need to act with speed and flexibility to maintain financial stability those consideration be very different from those that the pra and the fca make in their policymake role the government strongly support the existence of their secondary objective on facilitate growth and competitiveness note and accept that there be broad question about how the bank of england can support growth and competitiveness but this be complex matter and one that be well beyond the scope of the bill we will be resist the amendment for those reason see that our debate have attract quite lot of discussion around the edge if could hear myself think it would be nice turn briefly to amendment table by the shadow minister first reiterate that the government have make clear their strong commitment to support the mutual sector and reassure he that we take our commitment in the manifesto to double the size of the mutual and co operative sector very seriously many hon member on the government benches who serve as labour and co operative mp have great interest in this matter as have be demonstrate also direct the shadow minister to be fair he refer to couple of they to the package of measure that the chancellor set out at mansion house which include the consultation on the potential to reform common bond for credit union in great britain the chancellor ask the financial conduct authority and the prudential regulation authority to produce report on the mutual landscape by the end of the year she also welcome the establishment of an industry lead mutual and co operative business council the first meeting of which attend early this year be grateful to the shadow minister for raise the issue in the amendment the chief executive of the building societies association have write to about it and we be engage with he and the broad sector on the issue relate to the bill as well as on many other issue that be relevant to financial service and the role that the sector play in provide vital service to people throughout the country and as an engine of growth for the wide economy understand that the sector interest in this matter stem from provision in clause that give the bank of england an explicit power to require the issuance of security by the firm in resolution where the new mechanism in the bill be use this provide means for the bank of england to give effect to recapitalisation under the new mechanism establish by the bill its purpose be to provide additional operational certainty that if the bank of england need the fail firm to issue share as part of its resolution do so will not be put at risk by the usual administrative process of share issuance of course mutual have different ownership model with no share so the use of the power with respect to mutual would require the firm to be demutualise that bring to amendment which would require further detail to be include in the code of practice in relation to demutualisation specifically it would require the treasury to include guidance in the code in respect of the bank of england exercise of its resolution power in respect of building society in circumstance where the use of the recapitalisation power may result in demutualisation the guidance would require the bank of england to give due consideration to the impact of such demutualisation on member of the building society in resolution and on the mutual sector particularly when the bank of england could select buyer from the mutual sector to avoid demutualisation the bank of england be require to have regard to the code so would be require to have regard to such new guidance when exercise its resolution power in respond to the concern raise by the amendment note first that the bank of england already have the power to require the demutualisation of mutual firm when exercise its power if that be necessary to execute resolution effectively in the public interest the bill do not change that there be also circumstance in which demutualisation would not be necessary such as the transfer of mutual firm asset to another mutual acquirer we see that back in with the transfer of the dunfermline building society asset to nationwide indeed if the bank of england be seek to resolve fail building society its asset may well prove an attractive acquisition for another mutual so sale within the mutual sector may already be likely outcome under the exist regime whether in resolution or in recovery in the period prior to resolution it be worth remember however that the issue we be consider relate to bank and building society once they have fail in such circumstance the alternative to demutualisation as part of resolution may be insolvency which may have far more adverse consequence for member of the mutual as well as for the wide mutual and banking sector will the minister give way be afraid be be urge to wrap up remind member that the bill be fundamentally about protect the taxpayer we have third reading it fine we have not come to that yet my hon friend can intervene on third reading laughter take what be say into account although the government appreciate the point raise by the sector and by the shadow minister we do not believe it be necessary to hardwire in legislation requirement to update the code of practice on this matter understand however that the mutual sector feel strongly about this issue and my official and will continue to engage with the sector on it commend to the house our position on the new clause and amendment which be to resist they with the leave of the house wish to address one or two of the point make in the debate the hon member for hendon david pinto duschinsky be an incredibly valuable contributor to the debate because of his experience back in the day of the financial crisis if remember correctly that be largely result of the financial services and markets act which almost compound the problem by have tripartite regime that look after the banking sector at the time if remember rightly the chancellor of the exchequer at the time find it so scary that his eyebrow nearly turn white one of the surprising thing about that crisis be that just year early we have see the asian banking crisis which basically lay the groundwork for what subsequently happen in the west perhaps we in the west be too arrogant to believe that it could happen to we yet it sure do in my role as member of the treasury committee from to and on the parliamentary commission on banking standards look at all these issue very extensively it be incredibly important that we resolve the issue as it have turn out the financial services act and the financial services banking reform act have work well in respect of some of this resolution on the point about ldis and the financial crisis as result of the budget we deal with the problem pretty swiftly and pretty brutally when one of our leader get it wrong we get rid of they fairly quickly suggest to the labour party that if government front bencher get thing wrong it be worth cauterise the problem and move on on credit union and mutual we absolutely recognise the point about the mutual sector we be not ask for demutualisation to be rule out we be ask for the prospect of avoid demutualisation to be part of that very swift process that be why we will press amendment to division meet the credit union yesterday and they be keen that the principle of new clause be vote on so we will press that as well question put that the clause be read second time shockat adam gideon amos stuart anderson stuart andrew edward argar victoria atkins alison bennett bob blackman sarah bool aphra brandreth alex burghart alistair carmichael

helplessness that people feel when their home be invade by water we wad through what be once our living room survey possession and furniture destroy beyond repair it be horrible crush feeling and even after the water subside the smell of damp and sewage remain return to any sort of normality can take month even year my parent have spend the good part of two decade create home in denton holme that they love and my mam who incidentally will turn on saturday still talk of it after the flood she say she could never shake the sense or smell of damp and within month we have move house in response to the flood the then labour government commission and complete new flood defence and over the next five year million be spend on the design and construction of flood defence at the eden petteril and caldew river these be design to protect carlisle from storm with one in chance of happen and they do make major difference in and the defence be estimate to have prevent in excess of million worth of flood damage to the city but on december storm desmond hit carlisle it be storm with one in chance of occur the rainfall trigger the high level of flow ever record on the river eden in some location flood level be approximately mm high than those experience in such be the extent of the flood that the crossbar post at brunton park carlisle united famous stadium be submerge under water fortunately no one lose their life in and while the recently construct defence be effective at reduce damage and delay flooding in some location it be clear that more need to be do progress have be make in subsequent year and commend the environment agency for that since the catastrophic flood of some home be well protect thank to over km of new or raise flood defence there have also be improvement to two culvert and their associate inlet or outlet structure the carlisle phase and scheme complete in have increase protection for home and business around the warwick road and botcherby area of carlisle the carlisle phase scheme also complete in raise the flood defence along the river eden provide further protection to the hardwicke circus and castle way area the rickerby and low crosby scheme have also reduce the flood risk to local community it be particularly excellent that the latter take an award win innovative low carbon approach it remove historical embankment to increase the effectiveness of natural floodplain my hon friend be make an excellent and powerful speech about this awful problem that affect so many people particularly in her part of england can wide lesson be learn from the technique she be describe for example lesson about the use of natural material and about change in land use particularly in range of river catchment in my area in the thames valley both the thames and the kennet have flood as result of climate change they pose much great risk than they do many resident have concern about range of issue and wonder if my hon friend think there be wide national lesson to be learn do think there be lesson to be learn not least because carlisle have be so badly affect by flooding and it be so devastating lesson could be share from the scheme that have be introduce in the city particularly in relation to maximise the use of the floodplain in short while will discuss more generally some of the natural flood defence work that have happen on the outskirt of the city there have be number of scheme to the north of carlisle in the town of brampton natural solution like tree planting and the creation of wetland have be use to mitigate the risk of flooding from the brampton beck all while provide wide environmental benefit to the community new natural flood management scheme be currently be deliver at brampton fell farm offer further protection to the town there have also be the return of the wiggle river at howgill beck which be straighten more than year ago thank to the work of rspb geltsdale warden jen selvidge km stretch of the beck have be return to its natural wiggly state during heavy period of rainfall the river can now spill out on to the natural surround floodplain meadow help to reduce the chance of flood downstream towards carlisle as well as have the add bonus of create vital pool and damp patch for wad bird to feed on be delighted that early this month the restoration project win the prestigious uk river prize project scale award for natural flood management scheme like these have an important role to play and urge the minister to look closely at how redesign sustainable farming incentive can well encourage and compensate farmer who do the right thing by their local community for the loss of the income that they might otherwise have earn from the farmland that they have give over to natural flood management scheme one of the group that particularly deserve praise in keep carlisle flood preparedness under the spotlight be the carlisle flood action group since its founding in january in the wake of the december flooding it have do an excellent job of campaign for the defence that our city need indeed it be one of many example that show carlisle at its very good our community be one that pull together and nothing encapsulate that well than it take just day from the flood to get the aforementioned brunton park back up and run and ready for match once again some might say that give our form this season we could use little bit of delay to the end of it but will not dwell on that point let be clear more need to be do in january last year river level threaten to overwhelm the city again last may rainfall equivalent to one year storm lead to the flooding of property in the village of scotby just outside carlisle our change climate only make these sort of storm more common indeed the environment agency believe that the impact of climate change in the river eden catchment which cover near the majority of my constituency will be more severe than in the vast majority of river catchment in england at the very top of the list of what must be do be the caldew flood risk management scheme which many people in my constituency will know as the long promise carlisle phase scheme the one that be not deliver by the last government the scheme objective be to reduce flood risk to over property in the denton holme caldewgate and willowholme area of the city be grateful to carol holt the environment agency area director for cumbria and lancashire for accompany on tour across the area in february this year but despite assurance date back year resident have become frustrated by lack of communication from the ea since the project be first pause in due to viability concern we be not the only community wait for defence or even try to get maintenance do to exist defence after year of conservative dither and delay some environment agency high consequence asset be below the require condition that be one of the reason that be glad we now have labour government and an especially responsive minister for water and flooding welcome the plan investment of record billion in the next two year to build and repair over flood defence well protect property across the country last month over million be pledge towards number of scheme in north west cumbria include road surface work at etterby terrace and wigton road in carlisle and property flood resilience scheme at warwick bridge just outside the city which have be push the ea to deliver since enter this place and which be plan to be finish by winter some be secure for the long moot caldew scheme have be tell that feasibility study be due by the end of the summer and although look forward to their conclusion be concerned that even if path be identify it may be five to year until the scheme can be deliver tackle the risk from the caldew can not just be about create ever high and more expensive and impose flood defence instead we need range of measure both in carlisle and outside it to help slow and hold the water away from the city buy precious time for the river level to ease understand that the caldew scheme will be one of the large scheme that the environment agency have ever undertake but it be vital to the life of over resident in carlisle and to the prosperity of place that have be the centre of trading in north west england since before roman time recognise that deliver the scheme will not be quick and urge the minister to ensure that suite of measure be employ in the interim to mitigate the immediate threat from the river caldew those measure could include plan to remove aggregate and vegetation build up that slow the flow of the river through the city wish to address one other aspect of flood preparedness emergency planning be glad that further expansion of the flood warning provision have take place in carlisle include two new flood warning area at warwick bridge and parham beck cover combine property be also grateful for the flooding text alert that receive on regular basis but one issue that have be point out to particularly by the carlisle flood action group be the need for more information to be make available to the public ahead of an incident so that people can see where their near emergency shelter be plan to be in the event of flood understand that such information be not currently available so the first time the public hear of those location would be when flood occur my hon friend make very good point in my own experience and that of local resident alert sometimes happen in the middle of the night so it be extremely worrying and difficult for resident to respond quickly she be right that there need to be proactive element but do she also believe that there need to be well co ordination between private landowner local authority and the ea to tackle this issue particular concern about private landowner have be raise with will she comment on that point be aware certainly in the denton holme area that number of different landowner have responsibility for the maintenance of the river bank as my hon friend identify that patchwork of responsibility give rise to number of issue it would be desirable for more information about flood alert to be available in advance so that people could plan for such an eventuality but recognise that those plan need to be dynamic as highlight in people could not get to the emergency centre because it have be cut off by the flood water recognise that provide that information in advance will not be absolutely perfect but it would be beneficial for it to be make available if emergency location be know resident would have well understanding of where to move to in the event of an emergency and would begin to do so as my hon friend the member for read central matt rodda indicate when that all important flood alert come through would be grateful if the minister could consider that point in her response in summary urge haste have already say that we be in another year end in and that do present concern for my constituency we pass the year anniversary of the tragic flood in january and we approach the year anniversary of the flood in december so it be vital that we get on with deliver the scheme need to keep our great border city safe and secure for many year to come thank my hon friend the member for carlisle ms minns for secure this debate wish happy birthday to her mam who believe have her birthday at the weekend be really delighted to have the opportunity to hear about and discuss the step be take to prepare for flooding in carlisle and across england on personal level have to say that my hon friend constituent make an excellent choice in make she their member of parliament because she always lobby so nicely that be always nice but it also make it very difficult for ever to say no speak with the environment agency early and its representative also tell how engage my hon friend have be on flood risk reduction in carlisle and be very complimentary about her persistent and kind lobby protect community home business and farmland be our priority and that be more important than ever as climate change bring more extreme weather to the nation have meet my hon friend twice in the last year formally and many time informally to speak about some of the challenge that her constituency face understand the awful experience of flooding and know full well that flooding of any kind be devastating for those affect my hon friend have speak in this house on the issue of flood year after the terrible flood which be consider the bad in carlisle since and as she say tragically claim the life of three people in carlisle see further devastation from storm desmond know that she raise that issue last december ask the prime minister what assurance could be give on deliver flood defence that might prevent repeat only last year carlisle be badly affect again so understand my hon friend urgency unlike the last government who leave our defence in state of disrepair be pleased to share that the investment for this year between april and march include more than million across nine scheme in my hon friend constituency alone her constituency be receive this financial year of which be allocate to the city of carlisle itself know that she have express particular concern about the delay to the caldew flood risk management scheme which be delighted to confirm have an investment of this year for further development hope that reassure she that effort to reduce flood risk to more than property in the denton holme caldewgate and willowholme area of the city be firmly in motion my hon friend mention the caldew flood risk management scheme which in will receive an investment of in relation to feasibility study in environment agency consultant carry out feasibility study on further flood risk management option for the city of carlisle the outcome of which be that that option be not viable however another feasibility study be live on other potential option for flood risk management scheme include as my hon friend mention work upstream of the city the ea expect that study to conclude this summer great progress have be make in carlisle in recent year part of the area have some of the high standard of river and flood protection anywhere in the country with new flooding scheme design with annual probability of flooding my hon friend highlight the work of jen selvidge the rspb geltsdale reserve warden in help to return km of howgill beck to its natural state of wiggliness and the work of the carlisle flood action group to keep carlisle flood preparedness in the spotlight local flood action group play such an important role across this country lead by the community themselves those group give voice to local area and allow community to work in partnership with local authority and the environment agency pay tribute to all of they up and down the country turn to the use of emergency shelter in flooding event it be of course local authority that be responsible for set up and manage rest centre during evacuation provide temporary shelter and support for those who have be evacuate typically those location be not publish in advance as the location in use will depend on availability the location of the emergency and the number of people who may need to use they the concern be that publish in advance could risk people attend an inactive location or one affect by the emergency itself my hon friend mention one of the emergency centre itself be flood and therefore unable to be use we will however work with the local authority to ensure that list of potential shelter be publish which can provide resident with notice of where their near shelter may be set up during flood emergency local authority and the environment agency work closely with other emergency partner to co ordinate messaging include the possible use of emergency alert to affect community and local flood group to ensure that resident have timely and consistent guidance during an emergency speak to the environment agency this morning which inform that it would contact my hon friend the member for carlisle to discuss the location of emergency shelter in carlisle and how to make people aware of where they could be while take into account that in an emergency some of they might not be able to be use we do not want people go to the wrong place so there be balance to be strike but the environment agency be happy to talk to my hon friend in more detail carlisle be one of the many area in england that will be receive investment this year be therefore proud to share that in deliver on the government plan for change we be invest record billion over two year in the construction of new flood scheme and the repair and maintenance of exist one with that funding flood scheme have be support or will continue to be support help to protect more home and business maintenance of exist flood defence be also be prioritise ensure that further property will have their expect level of protection maintain or restore in total property will benefit from that funding help to secure job deliver growth and protect against economic damage we recognise that many flood defence project have stall over time due partly to an outdated formula for allocate money we have therefore make available million from the billion investment programme which have be prioritise for project that be ready for delivery ensure that nearby community be protect as soon as possible the full list of scheme to receive funding in be announce on march and can be find online and we will of course continue to invest in new defence because we have inherit flood asset that be in the poor condition on record follow year of under investment of the environment agency high consequence asset have be leave below the require condition in november report the national audit office recognise that increase investment in operate and maintain exist flood defence be critical to reduce the frequency and impact of flooding as such we be take decisive action to fix the foundation give community confidence that flood defence will protect they to support that action we be re prioritise million of investment in repair and restore critical asset million in to target repair towards asset damage in storm last winter and ongoing flood event and furth million this year to continue repair and ensure that asset be as resilient and reliable as possible and that they operate as expect in flood event in addition the environmental land management scheme present valuable opportunity to support flooding and coastal erosion risk management aim through direct funding of action provide revenue stream to support landowner work with ea capital scheme and indirect action which will lead to reduce watercourse maintenance requirement and increase the lifespan of our asset would like to reassure my hon friend the member for carlisle that the ea actively monitor aggregate and vegetation throughout the year for critical location that be trigger point and when those trigger level be meet gravel and vegetation be remove when timing allow if she have any concern about those level if she believe they have already be meet that can be another conversation to continue with the environment agency protect community around the country from flooding be one of the secretary of state five core priority which be why we set up the flood resilience taskforce to provide oversight of national and local flood resilience and preparedness that taskforce bring together ministers from defra the ministry of housing communities and local government the cabinet office and the department for transport the fact that we have so many ministers in the same room to discuss flood resilience demonstrate the priority give to that issue across government it mark new approach to prepare for flooding by bring together representative from national regional and local government the devolve administrations the emergency service charity and environmental interest group be pleased to chair the taskforce when it meet on february to look at learn from flooding since last september and long term funding and investment reform the discussion from that meeting be now be take forward through collaborative action group of taskforce member and we be look at flood warning flood recovery and flood insurance the next taskforce meeting will take place in may where the action group will report back on their work to improve flood resilience and well protect and support vulnerable community because flood warning be frequently mention as concern after flood event we be also provide vital funding to support great resilience for farmer and rural community the government announce last month an additional million boost to the internal drainage board fund which have be bolster to total of million from the previously allocate million it will enable investment in modernise and upgrade idb asset and waterway to ensure they be fit for the future more than hectare of agricultural land and around home and business across england be expect to benefit from the idb fund turn to the sustainable farming initiative more than half of all farm land be now be manage in environmental land management scheme that include more than live sfi agreement undertake range of action include to strengthen natural flood defence we announce on march that the current sfi budget have be fully allocate and we will continue to support farmer to transition to more sustainable farming model include through the thousand of exist sfi agreement over the come year and reform sfi offer now be the right time for reset of sfi support farmer deliver for nature and target public fund fairly and effectively towards priority for food farming and nature the government will work with the farming sector to prioritise funding for future year so that we can target those who will benefit most before reopen to new applicant there will be new and improved sfi offer with detail to follow in summer after the spending review the improved sfi scheme will be another step in this government new deal for farmer to support growth and farm profitability if my hon friend would like can share detail highlight her interest in provide view to the official responsible look ahead have set out plan to consult on new strategic vision for flood investment be pleased to say that consultation on reform to the funding formula will be launch shortly this spring we will ensure that the challenge face business and rural and coastal community be adequately take into account when deliver flood protection flood scheme proceed in and beyond will continue to be subject to the annual regional flood and coastal committee consent process with local elect representation and to decision from the upcoming spending review appreciate the work that the minister be do in this area she be prove herself to be an excellent minister who be willing to listen to those of we with concern about flooding as part of the review be it possible to investigate the role of lock and weir in river catchment and how they be maintain and operate when river be at high level concern have be raise with by local resident that some weir or lock this be an issue within the community which have not yet be able to fully check out may have be open at time of high flow when perhaps it might have be well for the water to have be manage in different way be it possible to have further consultation on that understand that in some catchment there be different way of lock and weir be manage and it may be that there be no national standard on the thames there be often lock keeper who be pay employee but with some tributary it be not as organise as that and it may be individual landowner who be responsible in our area the way that the kennet it be large tributary but still only tributary be manage be different from and less professionalise than the thames and concern have be express about that thank my hon friend for his thoughtful contribution as always and for his interest in this area the management of lock and weir probably do not come into the scope of the flooding formula review but have hear the point he be make and will talk to official about whether the management of lock be take into account with flood plan and how that be manage consistently around the country will write back to he on that if that would be useful the government record two year investment in our flood defence will well protect community across the country from flood it will also boost economic growth in local community by protect business deliver new job and support stable economy in the face of the increase risk of flooding as result of climate change through our plan for change this government will deliver decade of national renewal and economic growth and we be commit to ensure that community be well protect from flooding in the first place we will continue to deliver and repair flood defence improve drainage system and develop natural flood management scheme as ever the emergency service the environment agency local authority voluntary organisation and government departments stand ready to support affected people in any future flooding event and pay tribute to they all it be personal priority and privilege to be the minister responsible for flooding and will continue work to ensure that this country be more resilient to flood as the member for carlisle mention her mother birthday it be only appropriate that wish freda minns what beautiful name very happy birthday question put and agree to house adjourn
