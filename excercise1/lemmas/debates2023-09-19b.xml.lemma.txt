fill up the very small plane we go in to get there the rest of we all become porter for ann clwyd luggage there be lot of it and it be very heavy when we ask she to explain this she say do think it

she be truly an internationalist she be never afraid to tell it as it be in this place when she think other be get it right rather than we in that valedictory debate she say there be other reason why be pleased that go there first refer to the european parliament have to say that it be cultural shock for to come here because have not realise how delusional people here be will tell you why it be because we give the impression that we do everything well than everybody else when in fact there be many example of other country do thing well than we do and be pleased to have have the opportunity of experience that official report november vol ann be deeply and passionately welsh and british she be proud of our country and what we do in the world when we be at our good but she be also not
