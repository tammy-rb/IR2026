the chair although it feel bit weird to welcome anyone here give that have be here for about two minute follow on from the excellent contribution make by my hon friend the member for poole neil duncan jordan for cardiff west mr barros curtis and for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray among other praise in particular my hon friend for edinburgh east and musselburgh both because he give an excellent speech and because his mum be one of my constituent as start this new job have be think lot about my family be do so while prepare my remark today be think in particular of my grandpa who be coalminer in the coalfield of lanarkshire just outside glasgow when be wee boy he would tell of the condition that he work in darkness he say so black that you could hold your hand right in front of your eye and still not be able to see it in that darkness he would toil away unable to imagine his own future let alone that of his grandwean as he would say all the while he toil he be inhale fume so toxic that later in life he would have lung cancer and live the rest of his life with just one lung my dad welder be here today off during the glasgow fair along with my mum who run her own business to watch from the gallery my career so far have be very different from that of my parent and grandparent for start they have proper job whereas be now do this for living but it have be different for two relate reason the first be the labour party both in the sense that it have help to provide with new job and in the protection that it have deliver for work people health and safety legislation deliver by labour and build by the trade union movement have end the kind of condition that my grandparent work in the second reason my career have be different be technology suspect that today in britain there be more bitcoin miner than coalminer and that be ultimately good thing coalmining be difficult hard laborious work as kid spend many long hour in front of my computer and while much of that be spend play fifa against my wee brother mark some of it be more productive because teach myself to code watch youtube video and over week month and year learn how to build software develop iphone app that be use around the world mean that code write on my laptop in glasgow could be push out to device around the world in second and that this year old kid in his childhood bedroom could run an app servicing people from los angeles to dubai if it can do that technology can reform our public service too technology might even help to reform this house as we be debate today hope and know that high growth innovative business in my home city of glasgow will be key part of that much have be say and write about glasgow over the year but one thing stick with in particular anthony bourdain be not man know for his parliamentary language so let we just say that he describe glasgow as the most unpretentious place on earth an antidote to the world in his word so unapologetically work class and attitude free think he be right because of all the thing love about glasgow it be our people and our humour that enjoy most if someone ever get wee bit too big for their boot return home to glasgow will soon put an end to that something be sure will be increasingly useful the long spend in this place unlike many glaswegians my admiration even extend to some of glasgow politician it be customary in speech such as this to praise our predecessor but know that for some that will be do through slightly gritted tooth at the end of long and bitter fought election campaign in my case talk about my predecessor with genuine warmth and admiration stewart mcdonald serve the people of glasgow south diligently and build an enviable reputation in this place he be particularly respect for his long stand support for the people of ukraine something that see he award the ukrainian order of merit if leave this place have do half as much as he do for people around the world fight for democracy will leave happy man before stewart there be labour predecessor there be tom harris who have be personally kind to john maxton now lord maxton whose son teach modern study in high school believe it or not although will leave it up to other to decide whether he do good or bad job of that and of course teddy taylor who be still remember fondly by many of my constituent would also like to mention two other member of this house who have big impact on my life both from glasgow the former member for east kilbride adam ingram grow up in the east end of glasgow and be one of the first people ever speak to in the labour party his advice and wise counsel have be constant source of support to over the year and be incredibly grateful the other be southsider my friend and the former member for glasgow central anas sarwar have the great privilege of serve as the director of anas successful leadership campaign to become leader of scottish labour three and half year ago as we sit begin that campaign it be hard to imagine what the future might hold but even in our most optimistic of moment do not think we would have predict this stand here as one of scottish labour mps have praise three glaswegians will do something unusual for glasgow mp and praise someone from edinburgh my right hon friend the member for edinburgh south ian murray have be friend of mine for many year and he deserve enormous credit for his long and lonely shift as the sole scottish labour mp and for be someone who recognise that the labour party have to change if it be to earn people trust once again it give enormous pleasure and pride to see he in his rightful place as the secretary of state for scotland that brief interlude aside we return to scotland real capital city be privileged to represent glasgow southside place that have have something of renaissance in recent year boast the trendy tenement of shawlands the tree line avenue of newlands and the beautiful conservation village of carmunnock among other my constituency contain many of glasgow beautiful park of which linn park queen park and pollok country park be just few in the latter hon member will find the burrell collection which be award the art fund museum of the year award after its reopening last year like many part of the city however we be not without difficulty castlemilk be an area with enormous spirit and the kind people anyone will ever meet but it also remain an area with challenge even today the simple act of get supermarket in castlemilk have prove difficult something hope to change as local mp what be true of all my constituency be that it be an outward look diverse and welcome place the scots asian community in particular have contribute enormously to glasgow character and be very proud to represent they here in parliament immigration have make my constituency rich and it make our country rich too the southside of glasgow be also passionately pro european place although brexit be settle in the previous parliament intend to support the government move to repair our relationship with europe my first duty be to my constituency and my country be the member of parliament for glasgow south be the only job that will do so long as the people of glasgow south wish for to continue but also feel sense of responsibility towards the many million of people at home and around the world who do not have voice the people toil away in darkness just as my grandpa do all those year ago hope that none of we in this house forget the million indeed billion of people around the world who be not as lucky as we include those face persecution or war those without access to clean water or good education and those bind by modern slavery be one of the lucky few to serve in this place but will never forget the people who put here and the people who do not have voice deliver for they will be how judge my success it be an absolute honour to follow the hon member for glasgow south gordon mckee he speak passionately about his constituency and his love for his constituent be clear for all to hear it be also an honour to follow maiden speech from the hon member for ipswich jack abbott for spelthorne lincoln jopp for telford shaun davies for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson for cardiff west mr barros curtis for wolverhampton north east sureena brackenridge and for poole neil duncan jordan each be in their own way an act to follow thank the people of hazel grove constituency for place their trust in that trust be profound responsibility and be committed to repay it through hard work integrity and service to my community acknowledge the work of my predecessor william wragg who serve in parliament from until he stand down at the last election he stand up to those in power when he feel that it be need and he speak openly about poor mental health in way that be sure will have help to break down stigma on behalf of all resident of hazel grove wish he all the good for the future accept that may be little biased but hazel grove be quite clearly the fine constituency in the land it range from central stockport out to the edge of the peak district take in the community of bredbury bosden farm compstall great moor hawk green heaviley high lane little moor marple marple bridge mellor mill brow norbury offerton romiley strines woodley and some but not all of hazel grove itself whether the peaceful haven of our green space or the proud reminder of our industrial heritage hazel grove have it all we have the peak forest the macclesfield canal which have one of the steep lock flight in the country and our beautiful river the goyt the mersey and the tame it be no wonder so many people want to call our area home our river would be even more beautiful if the water company be not pump quite so much sewage into they we very much look forward to the government implement their plan to clean up that scandal however it be the people who really make our community start point social enterprise in woodley be tackle digital exclusion by give some of my more mature constituent the confidence to get online the cherry tree project in romiley empower young people to live their good life and nk theatre arts work with child and adult of all ability across the borough use creativity and the perform art to transform life local people have many of the answer that we seek on how to fix the problem we face as country my job and the job of this house be to empower they not tell they what be good for they be liberal and liberal democrat we exist to build and safeguard fair free and open society in which we balance the fundamental value of liberty equality and community and in which no one shall be enslave by poverty ignorance or conformity join the lib dems and get involve in politic because shout at the television be not bring about the change that we need my constituent have be very clear with that their top priority be our local health service they should not have hospital that be literally fall down they should not have to wait month or year for treatment and they should not have to struggle to care for their love one the phenomenal staff at stepping hill hospital should not have to wade through flood corridor to get to their patient because yet another pipe have burst as it do last weekend stepping hill hospital must get the repair it need and we need new additional hospital in the town centre so that local people can get the health and social care service they deserve will not rest until they do could not possibly make my first speech in this house without mention the last liberal democrat to represent my community andrew stunell andrew be the mp for hazel grove from to and he be that rare kind of politician who give politic good name he be an mp who set the standard to which all who come after he be rightly hold he be interested in do something not just be something he put his constituent first and bring about change in the law both as minister and as back bencher andrew make thing well for the whole country as minister he deliver the localism act but as back bencher he come top of the private member bill ballot in result in the sustainable and secure buildings bill become an act of parliament in more than all that he be one of the warm kind people have ever meet he be the kind of person you want on your team hard work honest and kind he help work out what it be to make difference in public life the people of hazel grove the whole lib dem family and will miss he and his guidance hugely be the first woman to be elect as the mp for hazel grove and take that responsibility really seriously be especially delighted to be member of the large group of liberal democrats ever elect to this house there be of we if we include the right honourable jennie go to comprehensive school and be the first member of my family to go to university before decide that shout at the telly be not bring about the change that want to see in the world and that stand for elect office be the way to be part of that change work in business as director of client relation my client be big pension fund charity and foundation be then the chief exec of charity educate woman and girl in the develop world for the past eight year have also be lucky enough to represent some of my constituent as an elect councillor for bredbury green and romiley on stockport council role have love be one of rather large number of colleague who come to this house know at first hand the value of local government and the desperate need for it to be fund properly turn to the substance of today debate which be standard and modernisation the main thrust of what we have hear from the government and the leader of the house that any further role should benefit an mp constituent be absolutely right in the short term we should of course stop mp from take on role as pay parliamentary adviser strategist or consultant in the long term daylight be often the good disinfectant so ask the leader of the house to consider whether publish any employment contract for outside arrangement with suitable redaction and the transparency that would bring would allow constituent to judge for themselves whether they be get value for money from their mp as new mp be strike and more than little bemused by some of the wonderful convention and habit of this house take it as read that colleague be honourable be good thing and refer to one another as the members for our constituency act as powerful reminder of who send we here but be also strike by how much modernisation be need we on the lib dem benches look forward to support the government when we agree but would expect we to urge persuade and on occasion push the government to go far and fast to make we the most effective we can be because our constituent deserve no less with so many newly elect colleague we have crack opportunity to change this place for the well it could be so much more efficient and so much more effective let we do that with fresh eye before we be all too institutionalised and think that some of this stuff be normal however that be also go to take some courage from the new government because make process and procedure less obscure so that more people understand they and make this place more efficient will mean that mp have more power and the government slightly less of it government especially government with new large majority be guess will probably grow rather fond of that power quite quickly so let we get crack alongside modernise this place we should of course reform our politic and our democracy more fundamentally the house of lords should obviously be elect and year old should be able to vote and we must replace the antiquated and deeply unfair first past the post system with fair proportionate voting system look forward to make the case for these change during my time here this election be the fourth time have stand to represent the people of hazel grove as the lib dem candidate and it probably take certain sort of stubbornness resilience and determination to do that it most certainly take the support of my family and especially of my partner ed be so grateful to he our mischievous rescue dog bonnie have not quite make up her mind yet about what she think about work away from home rather more but hope to be able to convince she that win be well than lose as it undoubtedly be win enable we to get stuff do and there be lot to do it be the honour of my life to be elect to represent my phenomenal community the people of hazel grove constituency they will be at the heart of everything do here and hope do they proud thank you madam deputy speaker pay tribute to the many maiden speech of new members have hear today include the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart for her fine speech hon member have speak with affection and commitment about their home constituency each of they rightly place their own area above all other and that be understandable but stand before you as the member for the old continuous constituency to send member to this house for almost year man and woman have stand as stand today proud to proclaim themselves the member for lincoln walk in the footstep of series of strong labour woman lincoln first female member of parliament be titan of our movement margaret beckett grafton house

transport provision he press forward with relief road for the city and now take up that cause too lincoln be beautiful historic young and dynamic city but we be far from other major urban centre and indeed from any of my hon friend on these benches we need public transport network that reflect that relative geographical isolation and hope to work with colleague across the house to make sure that lincoln and lincolnshire get the transport network they need right hon and hon member may not yet be sick of hear talk about the urgent necessity to upgrade the lincoln to newark line one of the slow in the country but assure they that they will be all of we elect to serve our community will of course be seek the support that they deserve as also intend to in relation to the cost of living healthcare and housing but also want to pause to pay tribute to the service my city have do for this country that service snake back even far than my predecessor over year ago in england seem almost lose french force loyal to prince louis have take most of england and even the majority of lincoln herself it be only our castle lead by woman in her mid sixty nicola de la haye the constable of lincoln castle who survive month of bitter siege warfare that finally repel the invader at the battle of lincoln secure the city and save england hundred of year later lincoln and her worker again spring to the defence of this country in the chaos of the first world war face mechanised industrial scale warfare of the most horrifying kind lincoln invent the tank we produce one in of all royal air force plane at ruston and the work people of lincoln deliver to this country the equipment and people need to prevail against the odd on these benches and in this movement we never forget that lincoln connection with the raf have never since dim and less than decade later young man include my grandfather train to fly at the raf station surround our city to this day we be proud to continue to host raf waddington one of the most important raf basis at this moment raf waddington and its brave man and woman protect this country and this house as do sobraon barrack in uphill lincoln be

tribute to my hon friend the members for spelthorne lincoln jopp and for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson and the hon member for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray for cardiff west mr curtis for poole neil duncan jordan for glasgow south gordon mckee for hazel grove lisa smart for lincoln hamish falconer and of course my neighbour the hon member for ipswich jack abbott whose great speech do justice to that town thank he for his kind word he be no long here so will stop the nicety there be in the fortunate position of have be send to this place to represent constituency and people that have play huge role in my life my grandfather grow up in east london before move to essex to raise family it be in the after retirement and with my grandmother mary that he make that all too familiar trip up the to settle just minute outside ipswich my early and happy childhood memory be spend fall in love with country and countryside that still call home today and county and people be now humble to represent in this place shock horror madam deputy speaker think central suffolk and north ipswich be bless with some of the most beautiful countryside in england but it be the history of the area that make it unique the anglo saxon king raedwald be one of the rich and most powerful of his era consequently suffolk have become treasure trove for archaeologist for nearly century my neighbour the hon member for suffolk coastal jenny riddell carpenter can boast of sutton hoo but on my far eastern border just last year year old pre christian temple be discover expert can trace back human activity in the area almost year be fortunate to have the beautiful market town of framlingham in my patch it be home to framlingham castle former seat of the famous howard family and st michael church which contain the tomb of tudor royalty and nobility and which love to take my two child to see also have helmingham hall in my constituency which have unbelievably host both queen elizabeth and queen elizabeth ii it be unsurprising give our ancient lush and beautiful landscape that we have rich history of produce great artist who be inspire by those surrounding thomas gainsborough john constable benjamin britten and even brian eno and ed sheeran to name few be all product of our wonderful county in some way or another be afraid to say that this child of suffolk be not bless with the same artistic talent the other great contribution that have always feel that suffolk make to our country be in food and drink have be tell by my wife that it be certainly domain in which have more expertise and experience central suffolk and north ipswich be home to aspall cider manufacture for almost year from apple tree in the ground of aspall hall it be now one of the most recognisable brand in the global drink market export product to customer around the world it be great example of global success by home grow british business we be great exporter of not only cider but sausage spud chocolate and condiment it be not uncommon to find suffolk produce in shop across the country it be for that reason that have in the past and will now in this place support initiative like that of my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans that give consumer in this country the opportunity to buy produce from producer in this country the suffolk farming and agricultural community be such an important part of our local society and they be also emblematic of our local culture and identity with their no nonsense attitude to hard work love for family and community complete and utter ambivalence to the weather and deep affection for our natural environment be sure that all member have their bias but be of the firm belief that the people of central suffolk and north ipswich be the fine our country have to offer while hope to be voice primarily for the people of suffolk and ipswich hope to use my time in this place to speak up for another cause in previous life before enter this place work under my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith at the centre for social justice and then as an adviser in the department for education in that time realise that the conservative party and conservativism have proud story to tell on the critical issue of help those who need help on offer the most vulnerable in our society not just handout but leg up and on stand up for what be just and fair in society more than anything they be about give people the opportunity to fulfil their potential count the ward of whitton whitehouse and castle hill as part of my patch whitton and whitehouse be two of the most deprived ward in our country castle hill be probably one of the most unequal by any measure ipswich be like its football team huge success story but large part of it include many family live in whitehouse whitton and castle hill have be leave behind the story be all too familiar the failure to adapt in post industrial economy generation of low wage work if not worklessness the proliferation of crime and high level of immigration that have cause degree of social polarisation for however long the people of central suffolk and north ipswich want to represent they will fight in this place to empower those people who feel left behind those who want to get on in life and those who want to and can reach their potential at time when faith and trust in politic be at an all time low among those who feel lock out of our economy and our society there be no more pressing cause than ensure that britain work for everyone today we be debate the merit of allow mps to have second job time and again on the doorstep during the election and across dining table for many year have hear from people rich and poor young
