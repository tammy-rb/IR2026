we stand there with mobile phone there will not be any connectivity whatsoever have write to ofcom and it have write back say for instance that in that precise location the coverage may be above or below the predict level lead some consumer to not get the service they expect there be phrase for that save it for another day organisation such as techresort in my constituency support people who be digitally exclude to become digitally include the minister have long list of meeting to go to so instead can the secretary of state come along the coast to the sunny town in the uk to visit techresort

area to achieve full national gigabit coverage funding will continue to be provide where it be need there be house that will be connect to fibre as result of the conservative project gigabit policy there be real concern that some of those will miss out if money be redirect from rural to urban community after the family farm tax can we please give rural community break the vast majority more than

friend raise we now come to the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster thank you very much mr speaker be very happy to associate myself and the official opposition with the right hon lady remark about ukraine democracy must stand together what be the government do to bring down inflation think it be astonishing that first may welcome the hon member to his place many people might not know that he be the minister with responsibility for growth when under liz truss inflation be at and growth flatline so we be do much well than he do well thank the right hon lady for her standard charm the truth be that the government be not do anything to bring down inflation this government be stoke inflation first we have above inflation pay rise for the union then we have budget that the office for budget responsibility say would increase order interruption be go to hear the question suggest that we all hear it together then our constituent can understand the answer as well as the question first we have above inflation pay rise for the union then we have budget that the obr say be go to push up inflation this morning we have city economist real economist say that next year inflation will hit do the right hon lady agree that this government decision mean high inflation for work people ask the hon gentleman or we have already talk about ukraine it be ukraine and covid that drive up inflation but this government be do it to the british people high tax high inflation low growth low reform there be word for that it be starmerism yesterday like many opposition members speak to farmer from across the united kingdom some of they be family who have farm their land for century elderly man in tear child worried about their parent and all of they worry that their way of life be about to be destroy what would the right hon lady like to say to they first of all we be absolutely committed to our british farmer that be why we have commit billion to the farming budget over the next two year that be the large ever amount for sustainable food production in the uk and it be alongside million to support those affect by extreme wet weather and over million to tackle disease outbreak the hon gentleman party could not even get the money out the door for farmer fail to spend over million on farming budget the farmer know that they be in it for themselves and that be why we be in government and they be not perhaps the right hon lady think that everyone come to london yesterday to thank the government let we look at the fact typical mid size acre family farm in the constituency of my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake have speak to their accountant their new liability because of this government be half million pound that be year worth of profit when this generation pass away that farm will become totally unviable and it be just one of thousand and thousand of similar farm it be clear the government have not get their fact right the central association for agricultural valuers the real expert in this field say so the national farmers union say so it be shortly to publish report show that of all commercial farm will fall above the threshold if the government be not go to reverse this terrible policy will the right hon lady at least commit to no further increase to inheritance tax and no further reduction in agricultural property relief or business property relief in this parliament the hon gentleman talk about the fact and absolutely stand by the figure that the government have set out the vast majority of estate owner will be totally unaffected the hon gentleman want to talk about the figure will be crystal clear the vast majority of estate owner will see no change and pay no tax on land pass on that be value at million couple can pass on million tax free and those above the threshold will pay only half the normal rate and can pay it over year interest free this be just another part of the budget that be unravel everyone here and all the farmer at home will have hear that there be no guarantee there we know what that mean they be come back for more even if the right hon lady have make promise today it would not have be worth fig we know that the environment secretary before the election promise the farmer that this would not happen labour promise get break let we put all this into context the treasury say that the family farm tax will raise on average million year the treasury also say that the public sector pay rise the government announce in july will cost billion year that be over time as much why do the government think that above inflation pay rise for the trade union be worth so order do not need any more from the second government bench please less of it we have have bit of run in recently and do not need to have any more think it be an audacity for the hon gentleman to stand at the dispatch box and suggest in some way that labour break promise or raise taxis will school the hon gentleman it be his government who raise taxis to their high level for generation interruption sorry we will have less of that as well unless you want to go and have cup of tea will we hear any more be that it now yes or no be you talk to mr speaker absolutely you be the one who be mouth have not open my mouth yet well be sorry but you must be able to do it like ventriloquist dummy it be the hon gentleman government who crash the economy who see inflation rise to and growth flatline it be his government who spend the reserve three time over will take no lesson from the hon gentleman understand why the right hon lady do not want to answer question about the terrible choice the government have make it be because the truth be ugly the truth be that this be punishment mete out to people who do not vote labour it be the same punishment mete out to parent who send their child to private school it be the same punishment mete out to the owner of small business who be terrify about national insurance contribution and it be the same punishment mete out to pensioner who can not afford to pay for their fuel this winter be it not the truth that if you do not vote labour they do not care about you hon member more there will be more and it will not be what you want more of after that display it be clear that the hon gentleman do not recognise the result of the general election and have learn nothing while this government have be fix the mess that the conservatives leave they have be desperately try to rewrite history they come here every week jump on new bandwagon and take new pot shot but with absolutely no word on what they will do differently last week the leader of the opposition admit that she support labour plan to invest in the nhs school and home the conservatives want all the benefit of the budget but have no idea how they will pay for they the face may change but it be the same old tory party straight back to put everything on the credit card spend the reserve three time over we take the difficult decision to fix the billion black hole that they leave behind and while they be reinvent the past we be invest in the future in new report human rights watch have set out irrefutably how israeli authority be commit the war crime of forcible transfer in gaza which amount to crime against humanity israel evacuation system fail to ensure civilian safety civilian be not provide with access to health nutrition and shelter that be compound by the banning of the united nations relief and works agency and much of gaza be now uninhabitable will the government acknowledge that israel have carry out mass force displacement in gaza and will they take concrete measure on arm trade and israeli official in order to comply with their duty to prevent genocide and protect palestinian life the situation in the middle east be catastrophic and know the whole house be horrify at the terrible loss of civilian life we be call at every opportunity for an immediate ceasefire with the release of the hostage and more aid into gaza but we urge israel to ensure that unrwa can continue its lifesave work something the foreign secretary have discuss directly with the israeli foreign minister we have impose sanction in response to appal incident of settler violence and have suspend export licence for arm follow review that find clear risk that they may be use to commit or facilitate violation of international law we will continue to seek two state solution with secure israel alongside viable and sovereign palestine call the deputy leader of the liberal democrats may associate myself and the liberal democrats with the deputy prime minister remark on ukraine ahead of the budget warn the deputy prime minister that increase national insurance contribution on social care provider would make the crisis in social care worse now obr figure suggest that the increase in nics will cost more to social care provider than the money the government have announce for that sector in the budget with that measure alone withdraw million from the sector will the deputy prime minister speak with the chancellor to ensure that at the very least health and care provider be protect from take the hit thank the hon member for that question the chancellor be sit near and know that through our discussion we want to ensure that social care be protect that be why we confirm million of new grant funding for social care next year an uplift to local government spending and an million increase to the disabled facility grant our employment rights bill will help deliver the first ever fair pay agreement for the social care sector as well and we will also ensure that the nhs be fund to help with the social care situation it be clear that social care provider will be bad off so urge the deputy prime minister and the chancellor to look again at that somebody else who be worried about the budget be cathy farmer in my constituency who tell yesterday that she think the government change simply do not make sense they mean that her family may have to pay bill that will force they to sell land which make food production unviable at the same time the government have not close the land buy tax loophole that can be exploit by equity firm and the super wealthy farmer tell yesterday that they feel as though they be betray by the conservatives and they now order thank you mr speaker farmers tell yesterday that they feel as though they have be betray by the conservatives but they now feel that they have also be lie to by labour will the deputy prime minister think again on this measure so that our farmer can feed britain again be sorry to hear that cathy be distress by the scaremongering around what the labour party be do the budget deliver billion for farming over the next two year record amount the last government fail to spend million on farmer our plan be sensible fair and proportionate and protect the small estate while fix public service that they rely on there be only seven place in england accord to the house library where school funding per pupil be low than in aldershot and farnborough do the deputy prime minister agree that something have go badly wrong when teacher be force to pay out of their own pocket for basic school supply while many other have leave the profession in drove over the past year will ministers work with to tackle the root of this problem so that we can give every young person in my constituency and beyond the very good start in life every child deserve the opportunity to succeed in school and beyond and be sorry to hear of the experience in my hon friend constituency last week visit ravensfield primary school in my constituency and its school council have lot to say about the resource to our school we have increase the core school budget by billion next year increase per pupil funding in real term as her constituency be the home of the british army know she will also welcome the expansion of childcare support to service family deploy overseas save family around year be happy to ensure that she get meeting with the relevant minister few week ago from that dispatch box the minister for food security and rural affairs say he have be congratulate by farmer on the introduction of the inheritance tax think that farmer must have be cannabis farmer because yesterday we have farmer on whitehall protest against this madcap decision do the deputy prime minister agree that the decision should be throw in the trash can along with rachel from account cv the hon member talk about cv and it be good to see he do well on his bench once labour councillor then tory mp now reform chief whip every time he switch party he get promotion have already outline what we have do to support our farmer we will continue to support the farmer and we will continue to invest in our public service to get britain back on track my right hon friend have come under intense scrutiny from the press at different time and she must have find it difficult press that be free to scrutinise politician be vital in free society and democracy be she as concerned as be by the stasi like interview that be give to allison pearson of week last sunday do she agree that the essex police force and other police force would be well try to deal with shoplifting burglary and other crime rather than intimidate journalist free speech and our press be incredibly important they be part of our democracy but in direct response to my hon friend question the police be independent and it be live investigation so it would not be appropriate for to comment on that believe that we should have free press it be part of our democracy and we should have free speech but with that come responsibility for those who do it yesterday meet three constituent in parliament duncan hawley his wife nicola and his year old daughter hattie duncan be sheep farmer and he have stewarde his family farm for most of his life he be outraged hurt and worried about the government deeply damage family farm tax he be deeply worried about food security food inflation and whether he will even be able to pass that farm on to future generation my question to the deputy prime minister be simple why have this labour government declare war on british farmer say to the hon gentleman and to duncan and nicola that this government have not declare war on farmer the vast majority of farm will not pay any inheritance tax we have protect they we have be as generous as we can the farmer rely on our public service like everybody else we inherit billion black hole from the conservatives who spend reserve three time over we be invest in our school our hospital our public service and housing if the hon gentleman do not agree with that then like the leader of the opposition he should say what he would do differently the previous government fail countless woman through chronic underfunding of maternity service at stroud maternity hospital post natal bed have remain closed for more than two year local midwife lead unit such as stroud deliver fantastic quality of care for woman while have low intervention rate during birth can the deputy prime minister outline what step this government will take to improve maternity service be sorry to hear about the situation in stroud and thank my hon friend for raise this important issue for woman in his constituency the darzi report clearly set out that under the previous government the nhs be break with patient wait too long for care we be committed to ensure that all woman and baby receive safe compassionate and personalised care through pregnancy birth and critically the follow month we will ensure that maternity service deliver the good outcome for patient as we invest to build an nhs fit for the future know how much professional care work mean to the deputy prime minister cariad care homes in porthmadog tell that it will not be able to absorb the additional exorbitant cost impose by her government budget it tell that they pose threat bad than covid to the business will she therefore personally intervene so that her government at least make care provider exempt from the rise in employer national insurance contribution the right hon lady be right to say that value the work of care provider and carer across the whole of the united kingdom that be why we have put in additional funding through the budget we have be ensure that for care provider and charity include hospice the tax regime be among the most generous in the world that include tax relief for charity and their donor worth more than billion for the tax year end april we have put record funding into our nhs we have increase funding into adult and child social care and we will continue to support our public service which be leave on their knee by the last government two week ago the chancellor announce historic billion investment into the nhs because

extra over the next two year for the department of health and social care include the large real term capital budget since we will ensure that every corner of the uk will see the generosity and that service will improve for they will make sure that he get meeting with the relevant minister to discuss in detail how plymouth can capitalise on that the town of cheshunt in my constituency have no

courage skill and dedication and we be all grateful to all of they at the heart of our british policing tradition be the notion of police by consent which be dependent on maintain mutual bond of trust between officer and the local community they serve but over the last decade or more policing have face perfect storm as visible neighbourhood policing have be decimate as law enforcement have struggle to keep up with fast change crime as outdated technology have hold force back and as confidence have fall in community and among victim because far too often people feel that if something go wrong no one will come and nothing will be do for too long instead of government show leadership and help the police to navigate these testing time predecessor in our department have just walk away this government will not stand on the sideline while public confidence and public safety be put at risk and that be why we be pursue our unprecedented safe street mission to reduce the most serious violence and to rebuild confidence in police and the criminal justice system to successfully deliver that mission we need force that be fit for the challenge of today and tomorrow that be why the home secretary yesterday announce programme of police reform that will be pursue in partnership with policing under our neighbourhood policing guarantee we will restore patrol to town centre and rebuild the vital link between force and the people they serve to drive up performance and standard new performance unit will be establish in the home office which will use high quality police datum to spot trend and improve performance and consistency and we will work with police to create national centre of police to bring together crucial support service such as it aviation and forensic we will present white paper on police reform to parliament next year the police funding settlement for police force include full detail on government grant funding and precept will be set out to parliament in the normal way before christmas but the home secretary confirm in her write statement yesterday that as part of that settlement direct central government funding for police next year will increase by billion that be core grant and additional funding for neighbourhood policing counter terrorism and the national crime agency we be at critical juncture for police and we can not go on as we have be so together with the police we will embark on this road map for reform to get back to those precious peel principle and to rebuild the confidence of our community in the vital work the police do every day to keep we all safe be grateful to you mr speaker for grant this urgent question yesterday the home secretary announce significant reform to police through write statement comprehensive restructuring of police in england and wales that will affect thousand of personnel create new performance unit and establish national centre for police surely merit some parliamentary scrutiny and an opportunity for member of this house to question what it mean for their constituent for my hazel grove constituent what do it mean for mellor the most rural part of my constituency there be no specific mention of rural crime in the home secretary statement so ask the minister what her plan mean for those tackle crime in our rural community what do the plan mean for place like woodley district centre in hazel grove which have see far too much antisocial behaviour and shoplifting and what do the plan mean for place like offerton where illegal off road bike be cause havoc on our road how will the plan well encourage the police to work with local partner to tackle this problem which blight so many people life any police reform must address the conservatives cut to the number of police community support officer who be so often the face of proper neighbourhood policing my police force greater manchester have see more than pcso position cut since more than anything we need to ensure that the reform deliver the proper frontline police that our community deserve year of ineffective resourcing by the previous conservative government have leave our police force overstretch under resource and unable to focus on the crime that affect our community the most it be no wonder that the vast majority of burglary still go unsolved while for seven out of car theft last year police officer do not even attend the scene it be genuinely good to hear that more resource will be commit to neighbourhood policing but as we see with the conservatives police uplift programme more resource do not automatically mean that community will see the difference would welcome assurance from the minister that the government will ensure that officer have the time and resource to focus on their community and will ensure more bobby on the beat very much welcome the hon lady interest in this area the write ministerial statement lay before parliament yesterday set out the direction of travel for this government on police reform as say in my response to the urgent question white paper will be publish in the spring there will be full consultation with hope parliamentary colleague as well as those involve in policing police and crime commissioner and all the key stakeholder this be the start of the process so many of the hon lady question will be part of the consultation and the conversation that we have next year but reassure she that the safe street mission be about the neighbourhood policing guarantee it be about deliver additional police officer pcso and special in our neighbourhood and reinvigorate the neighbourhood policing model the hon lady mention antisocial behaviour and shoplifting those be issue that we will deal with and we will bring forward legislation particularly around shop theft that will include stand alone offence of assault shopworker and the removal of the threshold that the previous government introduce which mean that there be almost shoplifter charter they could steal up to worth of item and there would be no action we be get rid of that we be take action now but we will have conversation about broad police reform next year the statement be about set out the direction of travel on friday spend some time on patrol with telford police and sergeant alex webb tell about her frustration at not be able to get repeat antisocial behaviour offender out of our town centre and high street when will the government give the police the tool that they need to deal with these issue and get the yobs out of our high street and town centre be grateful to my hon friend for his question this be antisocial behaviour awareness week which aim to focus on the effect that antisocial behaviour can have on individual and community he be absolutely right to say that we need to tackle antisocial behaviour that be why the neighbourhood policing guarantee which will get officer back on the street and the other measure that we will introduce to keep our town centre and high street safe be so important we will bring those forward in due course call the shadow secretary of state let welcome the policing minister to her role she be succeed in the job that do in the last government genuinely wish she well in the job and hope that she succeed in it because it be important for the whole country be sure that the whole house will want to join in thank the police up and down the country for the work that they do to keep we safe when they put on their uniform to go to work each morning they take risk that be require of those in few other profession in march this year the police headcount hit record number of police and high than the previous record my first question be will the policing minister commit to at least maintain if not grow that record number of police officer secondly will the minister join in welcome the fact that in the past seven year overall crime as measure by the crime survey for england and wales the office for national statistics say that be the good measure of crime trend have come down by the write statement yesterday and the home secretary speech to the national police chiefs council yesterday mention the importance of technology which feel very strongly about as the minister know in the march budget the previous chancellor commit to million of spending on police technology over four year of which this year be the first about million be due to be spend this year will the right hon lady confirm that the million for this year be secure and that she and her colleague will honour the million commitment over the come four year do the minister agree that it be important that police spend their time actually investigate crime not police thought do she agree that the guideline need to be change so that police spend time investigate only real crime and investigate non crime only when there be real and imminent risk of criminality that would mean change to the guideline will she make that change on the reform programme we need to see the detail of course but will the minister confirm that no money will be take away from local police force will she confirm that police and crime commissioner and chief constable will continue to be fully empower finally on police funding she mention some number for next year funding settlement she will be aware that when be policing minister we arrange million increase in funding for frontline police for this financial year compare with last year the number she talk about in her statement be much low than that so will she give commitment that any funding increase for frontline police that she bring forward in the police funding settlement will be at least as big as the one that announce last year this be the first opportunity have have to welcome the right hon gentleman to his new role as shadow home secretary but think he might be forget few fact as recall over the previous year the conservative government slash police by over police officer and many support staff as well acknowledge that the uplift programme be bring in at the end of their period in government but they get rid of lot of very experienced good police officer also just to remind he we stand for election on manifesto commitment to provide additional police officer pcso and special as part of our neighbourhood policing guarantee know that the right hon gentleman be very keen on technology that be absolutely one of the thing that he focus on have certainly take up some of the issue that he be concern about to do with live facial recognition and want that investment to continue think he be again forget few thing when he refer to the guideline for non crime hate incident as recall he be the policing minister who introduce those guideline have listen to what he say but think he need to remember what he actually do when he be the policing minister take the approach that this should be about common sense and consistency his majesty inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service talk about the need for consistency and training will listen to what it have to say rather than to the right hon gentleman view on guideline that he introduce many of the question that he ask will form part of the consultative approach that we will adopt when our white paper be lay before parliament my constituent tell that they be particularly worried about antisocial behaviour and that they want guarantee police patrol do my right hon friend agree that that be what this government intend to deliver very much welcome that question from my hon friend and neighbour in kingston upon hull he be absolutely right to say that the neighbourhood policing guarantee will include designate police officer pcso and special who will patrol neighbourhood there will be name officer that people can go to if there be problem around antisocial behaviour we will also bring forward respect order which will deal with the people who be engage most persistently in antisocial behaviour they can stop they be in particular neighbourhood or even put condition on they for example if they have an alcohol problem they may have to get treatment and help for that problem but he be absolutely right to say that antisocial behaviour be big issue for many of our constituent call the chair of the select committee dame karen bradley welcome the government announcement on neighbourhood policing we have already see real move in this direction in staffordshire under the leadership of the police fire and crime commissioner ben adams and our chief constable chris noble so very much welcome what the minister have say she will know however that the national audit office have raise concern about the experience of officer when it come to neighbourhood policing what work will she do to ensure that officer have the right degree of experience so that their effectiveness at neighbourhood policing be maximise can take this opportunity to welcome the new chair of the home affairs committee chairing it be one of the very good job in parliament on neighbourhood policing recognise that there be good practice around the country with certain police force do it very well indeed but she be absolutely right to say that we want to equip our neighbourhood police officer with the good training to enable they to do really good job for their community that be why we have already announce money for the college of policing to engage with neighbourhood police officer and give they the training that they deserve particularly in problem solve because that be really important part of the role that they will play in neighbourhood to deliver effective policing we need reform but police officer also need to feel that they have our support do the minister agree that agree the recommendation of the pay review body be key part of deliver that support what view do she have about those include conservative members who would prefer not to agree those recommendation and on the impact that would have on police morale my hon friend be absolutely right we need to support our police officer in the work that they do to keep we all safe day in day out he will know that this year we accept the recommendation of the pay review body and that additional funding be provide to police force to pay for an increase in salary it be important that we continue to ensure that our police be properly remunerate for the difficult job that they do the home secretary have make that clear in her support for police officer farmer in my constituency tell that they be often the victim of serious rural crime include threat of physical violence but do not usually bother to report it because they do not think our rural police force be well enough resource to give full response if that be happen across the country presumably it mean that rural crime be seriously under report what more do the minister plan to do to resource our rural crime team and to give farmer and other live in rural area reassurance that they can and should report crime the hon lady be exactly right we need to make sure that when crime happen it be report that be absolutely vital as say in my opening remark for too long people have feel that it be not worth report crime because no one will come and nothing will be do our neighbourhood policing guarantee be not just about urban area it also cover rural area and we want rural community to have the support that they need from police pcso and special be also responsible for rural crime and know that there be range of issue that we need to look at again include the theft of agricultural machinery that be an area that be particularly focus on just last night guisborough town fc in my constituency suffer break in and burglary be grateful to cleveland police for respond and for meet this morning to update on the situation but there simply be not enough of they on the street can the minister give an assurance that this government will prioritise frontline visible neighbourhood community police once again yes can pay tribute to cleveland police which have make great progress in recent time will the minister include reference to fraud in her white paper action fraud which would be more accurately describe as inaction fraud be preside over complete failure to do anything particularly about fraud against online retailer can we ensure that action be take to help victim of fraud reassure the hon gentleman that my noble friend lord hanson the lords minister be look at this gently point out that in relation to fraud we be have to deal with our inheritance from the previous administration we will now look at some of the problem with action fraud that they do not deal with the late crime figure show that shoplifting have shoot up to year high knife crime have rise yet again and violence against woman and girl remain shamefully and persistently high do the minister agree that this show the last tory government disgraceful dereliction on law and order my hon friend put it well this be why our safe street mission have the ambitious aim to halve violence against woman and girl over the next decade to halve knife crime over the next decade to restore neighbourhood policing and to restore confidence in the criminal justice system the liberal democrats have long campaign for proper neighbourhood policing so we welcome this announcement sadly have hear at first hand the concern and fear of one community in dartmouth follow police decision to redeploy local sergeant who have spend couple of year build positive relationship and trust with the local community particularly on antisocial behaviour and drug dealing can the minister clarify how the neighbourhood policing guarantee will be implement and how the home office plan to ensure that community have consistent and long term access to know name officer who will remain in the community gently point out that the liberal democrats be part of the coalition government and that through those year of austerity we see major cut to police officer include neighbourhood police officer however take her point that be why we have the neighbourhood policing guarantee and it be why we will have additional police officer pcso and special people will be able to go to name police officer if they have problem in their area as she request as say early we want to make sure that neighbourhood police officer be properly train and that this be see as very important part of policing so that officer want to stay in neighbourhood police for long my constituent in nantwich often report experience unacceptable antisocial behaviour at night particularly link to the night time economy so welcome the government plan to introduce zero tolerance zone and respect order to get grip of the antisocial behaviour that the last government allow to run out of control will the minister say little more about how this will help my constituent all members will know that antisocial behaviour can blight community and can cause real problem to individual and family this week be antisocial behaviour awareness week and be strike by resolve statistic that one in seven householder be think about move because of antisocial behaviour that be really shocking and our respect order and neighbourhood police reform will start to address the antisocial behaviour that have blight many of our community for too long the minister have outline the lack of confidence in police service across the united kingdom because of the failure to deal with real crime such as burglary shoplifting and antisocial behaviour at the same time we learn that three police force have spend year investigate tweet by columnist after report from someone in holland surely if there be to be reform one thing we should do be tell the police that they be no long the thought police they be mean to be deal with crime if that mean change the bad law introduce by the last government will the minister make sure it be do so that we do not have any more of this nonsense the right hon gentleman be right that this government be prioritise the crime that affect community and individual such as the increase antisocial behaviour threat and knife enable robbery those be the thing that people care about and those be the thing that our safe street mission be design to deal with in answer to the right hon gentleman question it be worth reflect that the provision on non crime hate incident come out of the macpherson inquiry follow the murder of stephen lawrence that recommendation be about provide an intelligence picture for police officer it may not be crime but the intelligence picture might benefit from know about it it be worth reflect on that of course want consistency and common sense in such investigation and as say early the inspectorate have also highlight the need for consistency and training because of the confusion about the guideline issue by the previous government be happy to look at that with the college of policing to make sure we get it right but there be place for it in some circumstance resident live around wilmot park in west dartford continue to be plague by antisocial behaviour include vandalism the use of motorbike in green space noise and threaten behaviour as part of their safe street mission will the government use police reform to ensure that such crime be prioritise in dartford and across the country want the police to be get on with this now and they have power they can use to deal with antisocial behaviour but we want to make sure they have additional officer through the neighbourhood policing guarantee to ensure that they can deal with antisocial behaviour in community we have be very clear that the police will be give additional power to make sure they can seize and destroy the motorbike and vehicle that be cause nuisance to community through antisocial behaviour have work with the right hon lady on committees over number of year be delighted to congratulate she on her appointment in that spirit will make what think be helpful suggestion about non crime hate incident clearly chief constable have huge discretion over how much effort they put into investigate local crime and non crime incident of the sort that she say have place in the spectrum could she perhaps require chief constable to report back to her department on how many hour their force spend investigate crime incident and non crime incident it appear that ten of thousand of non crime incident be be investigate every year thank the right hon gentleman for his comment it have be great pleasure to work with he on various committees over the year he be correct that this be an operational matter it be for chief constable to decide how they use the resource available to they my understanding be that very little time be actually spend on non crime hate incident but will check that with his majesty inspectorate of constabulary come from police family and have serve with the national crime agency be immensely proud of british policing however be equally devastate at the decline oversee by the conservatives can the minister outline what we be do to rebuild british policing and return it to be the good in the world thank my hon friend for his question and for his service we will all benefit from have he in the house share his experience and knowledge the police reform agenda as set out in the home secretary speech and the write ministerial statement yesterday be about reset that relationship with the police we want to work with the police this be not about do thing to the police but about work collectively to get the very good police service for this country for today tomorrow and the year ahead my resident in boston and skegness want the police on the street prevent antisocial behaviour and crime they do not want our valuable police resource waste on monitoring tweet for non crime hate incident threaten and bully resident and then that record remain on database which can prevent people from get job in the future it be complete waste of time will the minister and the home office scrap those guideline as an unnecessary use of valuable time and resource this government have be very clear about their priority on police in our safe street mission we have set out that we will halve violence against woman and girl and knife crime over the next decade we will restore public confidence in the criminal justice system particularly in the police and we will introduce neighbourhood policing which we know to be the bedrock of police in this country and the area in which most people want to see investment those be our priority as the prime minister and the home secretary have say and that be where the focus and attention of the police need to be for too long far too many of my town and village have have to endure rise level of antisocial behaviour such as people rid unsafe bike through village centre and an epidemic of shoplifting include at my local morrisons whose staff meet last month be work closely with our local police and crime commissioner john tizard to push for more robust police response what reassurance can the minister give my constituent that our new strategy will ensure that far great priority be give to such crime and that those crime will not be tolerate as they seem to have be far too often in the past thank my hon friend for his work in this important area this government be commit to deal with shop theft and attack on retail worker and we will bring forward legislation in due course our safe street mission focus on high street town centre and community so that people feel safe there be police presence and antisocial behaviour be not tolerate week in week out police officer from my constituency be extract to go and police protest and event in central london my constituent and be proud to live in our great capital city and in democracy where the right to protest be cherish however under the conservatives since the capital city grant have be cut by in real term that be the money that should be use to police such protest not community police resource which be what the metropolitan police commissioner be have to draw on will the minister review the capital city grant so that my constituent can see bobby on the beat again the hon lady will know that announcement about the provisional police settlement will be make in december in this house discussion be under way about exactly the point she raise note what she say about the level of abstraction which be concern but this government be commit to the additional police officer pcso and special in our neighbourhood the metropolitan police area will benefit from that as will every other police area when spend time canvass in my constituency of harlow as often do resident tell that they do not see community police officer any more in we have over pcso for the whole of harlow but we now have four will the minister set out how the safe street mission will make resident in harlow feel safe it be worth reflect on the fact that the number of pcso have halve in the past year and the number of special have reduce by two third those be shocking figure we want to ensure that we use pcso because they police neighbourhood in such valuable way also be personally committed to make sure that we see more special on the beat people who stand up for the local community and do such work on voluntary basis be to be commend hope that across the house we would all support an extension to the work of special cambridgeshire constabulary be one of the most poorly fund in the country under the current police allocation formula which be base on population datum from cambridgeshire have grow vastly since then and be project to grow by nearly in the next decade in order to fulfil the government pledge and ensure neighbourhood officer be not overstretch under her plan will the policing minister commit to review the formula before the forthcoming announcement of the police funding settlement so that cambridgeshire receive its fair share of the billion increase will she explain how many officer of the she mention each force will receive the home secretary announce yesterday that there will be billion of additional funding for police next year include money for the core grant and neighbourhood police the announcement about the police funding settlement will be make in december in this house in the normal way antisocial behaviour fly tipping off road bike and scooter race along pavement and street and an epidemic of shoplifting be all issue raise time and again by my constituent across all ward of portsmouth north do the minister agree that we need police officer back on the beat in local community equip with tough power to crack down on these crime to not only make the people of portsmouth feel safe but to get pride back in our community my hon friend put her point incredibly well that be why we have the safe street mission and why we will have those police officer pcso and special constable back in our community police for the vast majority of law abide citizen and deal with the antisocial behaviour that have blight community for too long in be run over by car in the netherlands wake up in hospital several day later with some fairly severe injury be thankful that the result police investigation be swift and efficient unfortunately that be not the case for such incident in the uk because forensic collision unit across the country be face severe challenge in prepare case result in large delay to trial and ultimately to justice prolong the agony for impact family what be the department do to help the police tackle those resource challenge and ensure road traffic collision case come to swifter conclusion be sorry to hear about the accident that the hon gentleman suffer in and hope he have make full recovery on his specific point will go away and ask my official about that and about what more we can do to ensure justice be do on road collision and that case go to court quickly be often contact by business from across gateshead central and whickham complain about high street crime recent spate of crime on low fell high street have leave some business potentially have to close with shop theft up in the past year alone what will these very welcome measure do to lower crime on our high street my hon friend make an important point high street be the lifeblood of our local community we want to ensure they be as safe as possible and that business be not suffer loss through shop theft and assault on their worker our package of measure will deal with antisocial behaviour put in place the neighbourhood policing guarantee allow new prosecution under the legislation we will introduce about assault on retail worker and get rid of the threshold for shop theft case to go forward one approach will not solve the problem so we will ensure we have whole package of measure to make high street neighbourhood and community safe and to allow business to thrive we need business to thrive so that they can pay their taxis and we can invest that money back into public service two year ago the metropolitan police commissioner say that officer be not deployable for reason of physical fitness and officer be not deployable for reason of misconduct allegation that be more than of the met headcount will the minister tell we the late number do she plan to make it easy for chief constable as they have request to fire underperform officer can write to the hon gentleman with the figure but clearly there have be issue with the metropolitan police over the last year and know that the current commissioner have raise concern about the procedure for get rid of police officer you in charge now if the hon gentleman do not mind have be the policing minister for five month compare with the year that those on his side of the house be responsible for police do not see any action then on deal with the issue that he raise with can guarantee that this government will be look at the workforce and make sure that we recruit the right people into police and vet police officer throughout their career because of the shocking case that we have see david carrick and other we will take action which we set out in our manifesto to have workforce that be fit for purpose know the hon gentleman be very new in this place but he need to remember the legacy that his government and his party deliver to we when we arrive in july whenever speak with resident business leader or their staff in my constituency they all tell the same thing whether it be the staff at wortley asda who have to deal with persistent shoplifting or the stallholder at morley market who tell that they have to deal with crime on the high street in morley they all tell that the police do not turn up and that they never see police patrol in our community any more can the minister confirm that we will return to neighbourhood policing that we will see police on our street patrol again and that we will have name police officer turn up when thing go wrong my hon friend be absolutely right that be the experience that many member of parliament will encounter when they talk to their constituent who feel that there be no point in report thing because nothing will happen and no one will come that be why the neighbourhood policing guarantee be so important we will have those police officer pcso and special back on our street that visible presence will be there so can absolutely say that that be part of our safe street mission and that be what we will deliver may associate myself with the comment make by my hon friend the members for hazel grove lisa smart and for frome and east somerset anna sabine particularly in relation to thing like rural crime car racing bike racing threaten behaviour burglary and shoplifting and the frustration that people feel with the delay and lack of response and with thing such as camera footage which be take every day not be use that frustration be none the less absolutely dwarf by the frustration of the fact that the previous avon and somerset police and crime commissioner have full time equivalent member of staff and massive budget my constituent have no idea how that be justify when what they want be police officer can the minister please make sure that her review actually include get grip on what be happen in pcc office the hon lady will have an opportunity when the white paper be publish to make she and her constituent view clear clearly there will be question around the different role the home secretary role the pcc role and chief constable operationally independent role and that will be part of the discussion and debate around how we take forward the white paper and the recommendation that come out of it thank mr speaker for grant this urgent question on subject that be on the mind of so many of my constituent stalk be form of psychological violence that remain severely underreported have meet constituent who be victim of stalk and they have share with the lack of support they feel they receive from the metropolitan police they live in constant terror and anxiety even after take the brave step of report the offence will the minister outline what step her department be take to work with the metropolitan police to ensure that officer receive proper training to identify stalk support and protect victim and take robust action against perpetrator welcome the hon gentleman question be really concerned to hear what he be say the safeguarding minister my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips be deal with the issue of stalk and know she feel very strongly about that it might be helpful if the hon gentleman write to she and will certainly raise the matter with she we may need to feed in the experience the hon gentleman mention to make sure the metropolitan police be do everything they need to to support victim of stalk who bravely come forward it be always pleasure to see the right hon lady she have move from the back benches to the front bench and be do equally good work welcome the safe street programme and the enhancement of community police can the minister outline how there can be uk wide drive in address the money lending and drug warfare that blight all our community throughout the united kingdom be think of paramilitary group in northern ireland and criminal gang in the uk mainland that work together and share their criminal activity what opportunity will there be within police reform to discuss how we can work alongside the justice minister in northern ireland and the police service of northern ireland we can do well together it be always pleasure to be question by the hon member when chair the home affairs committee we produce report on drug and we go to look at drug problem in belfast and in northern ireland be strike by the particular issue there around the involvement of paramilitary it would be helpful if the hon gentleman and could have conversation about what more we can do on that issue when we look at the broader safe street mission asylum seeker hotel accommodation urgent question to ask the home secretary if she will make statement on the government decision to recommence the use of hotel as accommodation for asylum seeker this government inherit an asylum system under unprecedented strain with many thousand stick in backlog without their asylum claim process the home secretary have take immediate action to restart asylum processing and scrap the unworkable rwanda policy which will save an estimate billion for the taxpayer over the next two year we remain absolutely committed to end the use of hotel for asylum seeker and continue to identify range of accommodation option to minimise the use of hotel and ensure well use of public money while maintain sufficient accommodation to meet demand in accordance with the immigration and asylum act the home office have statutory obligation to provide destitute asylum seeker with accommodation and subsistence support while their application for asylum be be consider we be committed to ensure that destitute asylum seeker be house in safe secure and suitable accommodation and that they be treat with dignity while their asylum claim be consider we continue to work closely with local authority and key stakeholder build on lesson learn in term of asylum accommodation stand up and management hotel be not permanent solution but necessary temporary step in keep the system under control and ensure it do not descend into chaos we will restore order to the asylum system so it operate swiftly firmly and fairly as we progress with that it be right that we deliver on our legal responsibility and ensure people be not leave destitute ultimately we will be able to tackle irregular migration and bring the cost of the system down by billion of pound it remain our ambition to exit hotel however in the near future they remain key to deliver on our legal responsibility in ensure people be not leave destitute may record my appreciation for secure this urgent question madam deputy speaker my constituent have have the devastating news that the roman way hotel be to be stand up to house asylum seeker this be after it have be close last year such move have significant impact not just on my constituent but in cannock more generally we have see people cross the channel since labour come to power which be up on the same period last year this must be see in the context of labour manifesto pledge in july to end the use of hotel for asylum seeker member can imagine the devastation that so many constituent across the country be feel when they see these hotel be bring back into use break one of labour manifesto pledge there be also total lack of transparency there be no consultation with local authority this be diktat that those authority receive with no support and no help and it be only news organisation such as gb news that be shin light on it will the minister provide list to the house of commons detail all the hotel that have be step up to provide accommodation for asylum seeker since labour come to power and will she commit to continue to update that list what be the estimate cost of reopen these hotel what have change so drastically that have cause labour to abandon manifesto pledge so quickly consider that there be correlation between the removal of deterrent effect which our party have put in place and rise in crossing what will the government do to provide credible deterrent go forward finally will the minister commit to cease to use the roman way hotel in my constituency and will she also commit to not put the hatherton house hotel in penkridge into use as senior member of the last few administration the right hon gentleman will know that we inherit an asylum system that have be grind to standstill by the previous government pursuit of the rwanda policy which be doom to failure they spend million over two year to send four volunteer to rwanda conservative members claim that the rwanda scheme be somehow deterrent but from the day that it be announce to the day that it be scrap people cross the channel in small boat if the right hon gentleman think that that be the definition of deterrent think he need to look it up in dictionary interruption the right hon member talk about increase in channel boat crossing since labour come to power but in the first six month of this year when the rwanda scheme be up and run and apparently about to start at any minute there be an increase in channel crossing again the rwanda scheme be an expensive distraction not deterrent the right hon gentleman ask whether we will produce list of hotel that be currently in use he will know that when he be in government hotel use peak at more than can tell he that currently there be hotel in use at the time of the election there be hotel in use but since july seven hotel have shut and have open which have create net increase of seven thank the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson for secure this question under the previous government when the current shadow home secretary be in the home office two hotel in my constituency be open there be no notification to the local authority and no consultation this be another example of the conservative party cry over the mess that they make and the attempt that this government be make to clear it up do the minister agree that we will smash the criminal gang and stop those channel crossing and that the carping from conservative members demonstrate that they have learn nothing since their election defeat strongly agree with my hon friend we inherit system that be at standstill there be backlog of case involve people and the law would not allow they to be process we have restart processing we be gear up the asylum system so that we can get throughput in the system and ultimately exit the hotel and start use more cost effective system agree with my hon friend that the carping by conservative members who create the backlog and the mess that we be have to deal with be bit rich call the shadow secretary of state congratulate my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson on secure this urgent question he be right to raise this issue as he say labour promise in its manifesto to end the use of hotel yet the minister have just admit at the dispatch box that far from end the use of hotel the government be in fact open up even more she have just admit to perhaps it should come as no surprise now that once again labour be do the precise opposite to what it promise in its manifesto when the conservatives be in government they be in fact close down hotel luckily have the figure in front of between september last year and june this year the number of people in contingency accommodation which be home office speak for hotel go down by go down yet under this new government it be go up the minister have tell we how many hotel have open up will she tell we how many extra people be now in contingency accommodation compare with july will she also commit to always notify member of parliament in advance at least two week in advance that hotel will be open in their constituency we all know the cause of this problem it be the illegal and dangerous channel crossing be afraid the position have get even bad since the figure my right hon friend quote be draw up since the election people have cross the channel that be increase on the same period last year and it be increase on the same period immediately before the election why have these number of people illegally cross the channel go up the national crime agency have tell we that we need deterrent that we can not police our way out of this even ursula von der leyen the president of the european commission have say that european member state should look at offshore processing we see deterrent system work in australia yet labour scrap the rwanda deterrent before it have even start the first flight have not take off and that be why the deterrent effect have not commence will the minister follow ursula von der leyen advice will she emulate the australians and reinstate the scheme that be quite rant it make certain assumption that be completely untrue include that the rwanda scheme would have work we already know that it cost million to send four volunteer to rwanda the conservative party be plan to spend per person send to rwanda and it have not manage to send anyone to rwanda have the conservatives put aside the money go into billion of pound to pay this per person send to rwanda no they have not no money be set aside what we inherit be system where no processing be go on well few than asylum case month be be process we be now process up to asylum case month the right hon gentleman know because he be home office minister that there be backlog and lag between the first decision in processing and all the potential appeal we can not exit people from the asylum estate until they have final decision we inherit backlog of more than two year in the tribunal system because the conservatives do not fund it properly in the last period we have return nearly people which be nearly increase on the number return last year we be work on make the asylum system fit for purpose we inherit an unholy mess from the conservatives know that the government understand that use hotel to house asylum seeker be bad for community for the taxpayer and ultimately for those seek asylum themselves conservative members break our asylum system and now wash their hand of the consequence will the minister outline the progress that the government be make on clear the backlog that the conservatives create so that we can stand down hotel include by prioritise the processing of those house in the cresta court hotel in my constituency we be prioritise get the system up and run again so that we can have throughput in our asylum accommodation estate the fact that the system have grind to complete halt when we come into government with unprocessed case have mean that there have be delay in get it up and run explain to the house that we have go from make asylum decision month to the system be begin to get flow through and as that happen we will exit from hotel we have have to have small increase we have be in power four month the manifesto do not say that we would end the use of hotel in four month when the conservatives be in power more than hotel be in use at its height and they do not give any mp two week notice that those hotel be open call the liberal democrat spokesperson while an asylum seeker wait month or even year in hotel for decision on their claim they be trap in limbo they be unable to work and be force to depend on government fund that benefit no one not the asylum seeker who want to get on and start rebuild their life and not taxpayer who foot the bill that be before mention our local council which be leave to pick up the piece to end the use of hotel tackle the backlog that balloon on the previous government watch must be part of the solution but we can also reduce the demand for government accommodation by allow asylum seeker to support themselves and contribute to the economy something that the home office have recognise will not act as pull factor for asylum seeker will the minister finally scrap the ban on asylum seeker work and pay their fair share as doctor or dentist if they have be wait three month or long for decision on their claim will she commit to provide local council with the resource that they need both funding and clear guidance to provide proper support for asylum seeker and the local community host these hotel do not agree that allow asylum seeker to work while their claim be be consider will not be pull factor the way to deal with this issue be to have fast fair and efficient asylum system we be look at how we can redesign it and at what we can do to deal with the huge backlog that we inherit not least in the tribunal system when there be appeal we need much well end to end system that be fair and efficient that will mitigate any of the issue that the hon lady raise with respect to asylum seeker not be allow to work be that restriction to be lift believe that it would be huge pull factor which would have potentially serious consequence congratulate the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson on secure this urgent question on matter that the home affairs committee be look at but be astonish that he want to draw attention to the conservatives legacy in this area in the home office be spend per asylum seeker per year on accommodation by it be spend per asylum seeker per year at that point it stop take decision so the number could only grow as the uk taxpayer pay for asylum seeker to stay in hotel accommodation do the minister agree that the correct way to deal with the issue be to seriously address the systemic problem in the immigration system such as the lack of any decision be take and not ridiculous gimmick such as wave machine and deterrent for four people agree that it be about do the day job effectively and efficiently and if it can not be do effectively and efficiently redesign it so that it can be rather than have huge row with the international community threaten to leave the european convention on human right and set up parallel scheme that be not agree by anybody which spend vast amount of money and grind the system to halt that be not the way to achieve success in this area consider the use of wave machine to somehow send boat back to france just about sum up the reality of the conservatives attitude to what be difficult situation the prime minister have pledge to smash the gang and the minister appear to be very confident in her position so can she tell the house which metric we should use to judge whether the gang have be smash and the channel crossing end and by what date that will happen the conservative party allow can you answer the question will answer in my own way the conservative party allow channel crossing to be industrialise we be now face very sophisticated set of international supply chain that need international co operation to be take down and disrupt we have establish the border security command we have announce the investment of million and we be get additional investigator to look at this matter we manage to achieve very significant arrest of an offender just the other week which will begin to degrade the capacity of international organise criminal gang to smuggle people on to our shore the hon gentleman will see when the number start to go down as will the rest of we the minister have inherit an incredible mess reportedly billion of overseas aid will be spend on refugee and asylum seeker in this country this year but simply end the use of hotel will not solve some of the problem that the system be cause in our community lot of the private provider of asylum accommodation buy up property in the most deprived part of city think that the government big challenge be to rebuild trust with the public ask she to consider the difference between the homes for ukraine system of housing people and the system of allow big corporate and profiteer company to house asylum seeker and to think about how we involve civil society and our community in the way we respond to the need of asylum seeker my hon friend will be comfort to know that be think of precisely those thing do not envy the hon lady in her job do she agree that no amount of hotel accommodation will ever suffice as long as there be no effective way of prevent large number of people from come into this country without permission as form of interception near the french coast will probably be the only deterrent will she at least keep open the possibility of negotiation with france as to how we could work together to do that we have relatively new government in france just bed in reassure the right hon gentleman that we be work closely with they to see how we can strengthen and deepen our co operation and partnership the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson who raise the urgent question appear to be suffer from some memory loss under the conservative government we see small boat crossing and record backlog at the home office the conservatives open hotel that is place cost million per day to the taxpayer do the minister recall he raise that issue under the previous government no do not notice the revelation at the weekend about why the conservatives decide to call the election early than some of we have perhaps think one reason set out in tim shipman book out be that illegal migration be problem with new armada of small boat predict and the issue of whether they would be able to get repatriation flight to rwanda in the air before polling day they evidently decide that they could not we be now hear this complete fiction from conservative members that somehow the rwanda scheme be just about to work before we scrap it when they have spend million on an increasingly futile and ridiculous attempt to get the scheme off the ground here we go again with this new labour government simply copy and ape the failed and disastrous policy of the conservative government on hotel accommodation while engage in this grotesque competition to see who can sound the hard on asylum seeker why not be bold and imaginative many of these asylum seeker be highly educate with skill that could be deploy in community up and down the united kingdom the ridiculous answer that the minister give to the liberal democrats about the uk be pull to asylum seeker be simply nonsense and she know that with the ten of thousand come to our shore right now why not get they usefully employ instead of leave they to rot in hotel across the uk we certainly want those who gain status to be usefully employ and my part of the system be ensure that we get those asylum decision up and run as fast as possible unfortunately we have inherit difficult situation which we be work hard to resolve once someone have gain status in this country of course they be able to work so we have to get the system work fast in my constituency two hotel be open under the previous conservative government and they be still there so find the new concern from conservative members slightly disconcert although accept what the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy say about this now be the labour government problem be certain that conservative members do not want to publicly defend their appalling legacy will need little less from they the question put to the that be how it work here we ask question and wait for the answer interruption the shadow home secretary the right hon member for croydon south chris philp can keep quiet school in my constituency say that access child in those hotel for educational welfare visit or safeguard check be prove more and more difficult because the provider do not understand their responsibility encourage the minister to speak to her counterpart in the department for education and the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that those necessary check to keep child safe can be do unimpeded since we come into government we have do much more to co operate across departments and will certainly take that issue up with my opposite number in the department for education and mhclg two hotel in my constituency of east londonderry be be use and we have problem enough try to provide good quality hotel with royal portrush come up next year we need to see gradual continuous reduction in hotel accommodation be use for this purpose will the minister address that and try to show some sense of direction on when that will be achieve we be process asylum claim which be at standstill when we come into government not least those that be extant in northern ireland hope that will lead to process where we get throughput in the system and we begin to exit hotel welcome the minister inform the house that return figure be now at nearly which be up from last week may ask on behalf of my constituent how we can make return even fast for the integrity of any asylum system it be important that person who be not grant asylum recognise that they do not have the right to stay in the country hopefully they will leave voluntarily if not they will be remove immigration enforcement which operate out of the home office be focus on increase total return as say they be up on the same period last year and we intend to double down and carry on in boston and skegness we want the use of hotel by asylum seeker to stop as be the case across the country under the previous labour government year ago process and application be deal with within three to four week include appeal and only about of application be grant asylum when will the minister and the home office get back to the sensible workmanlike process that work year ago we be work on it but as the hon gentleman know we have inherit huge mess with large backlog that be not easy to clear associate myself with the comment of the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice who have eloquently describe how it use to work under the previous labour government in fact on the last day of the number of people on an asylum waiting list be around in june this year the asylum caseload be that be time high the brass neck frankly of conservative members to come here and criticise we be genuinely breathtaking give that we have get three of the large deportation flight in british history off the ground in four month do the minister agree that although there be far more to do the plan be work yes but it be tough and difficult and to be successful it require international co operation across border operationally politically and diplomatically and we be do that yesterday the minister finally reply to my letter after my datchet constituent be give next to no notice about single adult male be house at the manor hotel she say the number house there could reach as high as people and she give no indication about how long they would be there in breach of her manifesto commitment will she now give my constituent concrete timetable for when the misuse of the manor hotel will end our manifesto commitment be not to close all asylum hotel within four month of be elect it be truly astonishing to hear the conservatives come here today to defend their rwanda million spend on four deportee or million each they could have purchase five star hotel for each of they surely the minister agree that the money be far well spend on intelligence enforcement and of course processing to get the backlog that we inherit down certainly do agree be sure that the vast majority of member accept that the new government have inherit complete and utter shamble of an asylum system and be have to clear up another area of tory mess part of that clearing up will involve sort out and process asylum application promptly so will the minister give we more insight on how she be do that my area have asylum hotel impose upon it by the last conservative government how will the government avoid principal holiday accommodation area take further such hotel we certainly be have to get the system back up and run from virtual standing start as the hon gentleman rightly point out that mean that we have be able as say to go up from process only asylum claim month to nearly month those who have go through the whole system and have receive grant for example need then to exit our asylum accommodation that allow we to backfill and in the end to exit hotel however that be not an instant solution the system have grind to halt and we must redeploy resource to get it up and run again it be worth remember that when this government come into office we be in the middle of the bad year ever for small boat crossing the number of crossing be high than in the previous record year that be afraid be the legacy of chaos and failure that the conservative party leave behind there be still long way to go in tackle the crossing but do the minister welcome the fact that so far total arrival this year be down on welcome any progress but also recognise the seasonality of arrival unlike the last government be not here to tell the house that there be any quick or easy solution to this difficult problem we be get the system up and run we have create the border security command to start disrupt and degrade the gang that be smuggle people across the channel and we will assert the right of the rule of law to exist and get our asylum system work so that we can stop those dangerous crossing however can not stand here and say that magic wand that can easily be wave it will take hard cross jurisdictional and cross country work and that be what the border security commander have be appoint to do that be what the extra million of resource give to that job be there to do that be what our operational and national crime agency people be there to do and be do we have hear today that more than illegal have come in on small boat since the government come into office do the minister have any figure on the influx in the united kingdom of illegal and other from the republic of ireland where there be no check on the question of hotel how can my constituent judge her party manifesto pledge to reduce the number of hotel to help they do that will she undertake to publish on monthly or bi monthly basis the number of hotel in use in each constituency and the number of illegal accommodate in they no the previous government do not do that either for safeguarding and public safety reason as the hon gentleman know it be rather gall for the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson to protest about hotel in his constituency be use that be clearly the result of backlog create by the conservatives when in government as they waste hundred of million of pound of taxpayer money on gimmick that they know would never work surely my hon friend agree that the right answer be well and fast processing that be fair for those seek asylum fair for those in community where hotel be be use for asylum accommodation and fairer for the taxpayer agree of course the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson know only too well that the same hotel be open from november to february and he do not complain about it in the house then will the minister outline the safety procedure in place to ensure that there be additional community police in the area around the hotel as literally hundred of single man be descend on small hotel and community that be safety issue and all our constituent across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland deserve to have that reassurance there be safeguarding and safety issue go in both direction see report of asylum seeker service user be attack and injure as well as of attack in the other direction in small number of case we always liaise with the local police and local authority we take an intelligence lead approach to see whether there be outside agitation or difficulty and we be in constant contact with local service and our service provider to ensure the safety of service user and local population thank the minister for her statement and be respond to it in the context of my entry in the register of members financial interests can only agree with she on rwanda not only be that scheme an inhumane shamble but it have bring shame and ridicule to our country and be glad to see the back of it welcome her commitment to bring dignity and respect to the immigration system and her acceptance that the way in which the hotel have be operate be big part of that the joseph rowntree foundation recent destitution by design report which be author by professor beth watts cobbe researcher at the institute for social policy housing equalities research in my constituency make absolutely clear the human impact of the so call hostile immigration policy operate by the previous government on real people in our country be the minister aware of that report and if not will she commit herself or one of her staff to speak to professor watts cobbe about its finding be happy to check out the report and will write to my hon friend be grateful to the minister for come to the house to set out the government measure to deal with this issue share my colleague amazement about the new find concern of conservative be not sure why the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson be heckle this time last year under the conservative government we have more than hotel and more than hotel room in use for asylum seeker and we be spend million day on hotel do the minister agree that although the conservatives be apparently happy with that this labour government be not and we be take step to deal with their mess thank my hon friend for his observation clearly we begin from the situation that we find when we come into office in this case the system be in chaos with rwanda scheme that be an unworkable and massively expensive distraction which mean that no processing of any of the asylum claim make from march be happen we have huge backlog we have have to switch the system and divert resource from fail rwanda scheme into processing and the border security command so that we can deal with the cause of the problem rather than pretend that it do not exist defence programmes developments with your permission madam deputy speaker will make statement on defence programme development have now be secretary of state for four month and it be an honour and privilege to have this job every day meet staff from the military the civil service and industry who be totally inspiring and dedicated to keep this country safe often unseen and unheard by we and by the public we be proud of their professionalism and thank they for everything that they do this be new government get on with deliver for defence we have step up support for ukraine sign the landmark trinity house agreement with germany and give force personnel the large pay rise in more than year we have confirm defence as priority sector as part of the government industrial strategy and this week we secure the second reading of the armed forces commissioner bill to improve service life labour be the party of defence and we will make britain well defend we know that these be serious time we have war in europe conflict in the middle east and increase global threat technology be rapidly change the nature of warfare as we see right now in ukraine before the election we know that there be serious problem with defence one previous conservative defence secretary tell the house that our armed force have be hollow out and underfunde over the last year however as have tell the house since take office the problem be even bad than we think the inheritance be dire the state of the finance and the force be often hide from parliament with billion pound black hole in defence plan taxpayer fund be waste and military morale down to record low that be why we be take swift action to inject investment get grip on ministry of defence budget and kick start much need reform to start fix the foundation for uk defence will update the house on what we be do first will mention investment in july the chancellor expose the billion black hole at the heart of the government plan there be hundred of unfunded pressure this year and into the future the first duty of the government be to keep this country safe which be why the chancellor announce in the budget that defence will receive boost next year of nearly billion to start to fix the foundation for our force the chancellor also tell the house that we will set clear path to of gdp on defence which will be fully fund unlike the conservatives unfunded pre election gimmick which be never build into government finance this be not just about how much we spend on defence it be how we spend that count that be why we be conduct strategic defence review at pace to assess the threat we face and the capability we will need in the future that be also why have introduce tight financial control on the department include million reduction in plan consultancy spending we be get grip on mod budget and invest in people and future technology secondly will mention kit and capability for too long our soldier sailor and aviator have be stick with old outdated equipment because ministers would not make the difficult decommissioning decision as technology advance at pace we must move fast towards the future so with full backing from our service chief can confirm that six outdated military capability will be take out of service these decision be set to save the mod million over the next two year and up to million over five year saving that will be retain in full in defence alongside this statement have make write ministerial statement outline the detail of my decommissioning decision they include decision to decommission hms northumberland frigate with structural damage that make she simply uneconomical to repair watchkeeper mark which be year old army drone that technology have overtake and hms albion and hms bulwark land ship effectively retire by previous ministers but superficially keep on the book at cost of million year they also include decision to decommission chinook some more than year old which will be accelerate out of service two wave class tanker neither of which have be to sea for year and puma helicopter some of which have more than year of fly their service will not be extend recognise that they will mean lot to many who have sail and fly in they during their deployment around the world they have provide valuable capability over the year but their work be do and we must now look to the future all current personnel will be redeploy or retrain no one will be make redundant as the first sea lord say about the retirement the threat be change so we must have the self confidence to make the change require of course we should be in no doubt that the future of our royal marines and its elite force will be reinforce in the sdr these be common sense decision that previous government fail to take they will secure well value for money for the taxpayer and well outcome for the military they be all back by the chief and take in consultation with strategic defence reviewer ally have be inform and we have constant dialogue with nato those will not be the last difficult decision that will have to make give the defence inheritance that we be leave with but they will help we to get grip on the finance and give we great scope to renew our force as we look towards the strategic defence review and spend of gdp on defence thank the chief for their determination to work with on this thirdly will mention reform defence reform have be of little interest to recent defence secretaries it do not make headline or advance career but the way that defence work must change to deal with the increase and diversify threat recently launch the big reform programme in defence for year to create strong uk defence centre secure well value for money and well outcome for our armed force and well implement the strategic defence review central to reform defence will be our new fully fledge national armament director whose recruitment be under way the chief of the defence staff will oversee new military strategic headquarters operate from the end of where he will formally command the individual service chief for the first time he will be central in prioritise investment and spending between the service the permanent secretary will lead lean department with more policy muscle and influence these reform will ensure fast delivery well integration and clear accountability across defence to make our force fit to fight in the future finally will mention our people this government be put defence people at the heart of our defence plan we inherit conservative crisis in military recruitment and retention target have be miss every year for year and morale be at record low we can not fix those deep set problem overnight but minister be on mission to lift military morale we have award the force the large pay increase in more than year and can announce that from april be introduce new retention payment for cohort of tri service aircraft engineer who sign up for an additional three year of service it will be open to around personnel in total from january we have new retention payment for army personnel who have serve for four year that will support personnel year for three troop in total have set out where we be and where we be go we be in new era of rise global tension and we need new era for uk defence to achieve that the government be invest billion extra next year and set clear path to we be drive far reach reform and fix the foundation for our armed force to make britain well defend strong at home and secure abroad call the shadow defence secretary we have hear it all today the secretary of state claim that labour be the party of defence when barely an hour and half ago prime minister question be take by deputy prime minister who along with the foreign secretary vote against the renewal of trident the secretary of state talk about inherit financial black hole remind the house that in when the conservative party last take office the deficit be of gdp and we be on the verge of bankruptcy when labour take office in july the deficit be of gdp have the deficit labour inherit be the same as in it would have be billion big the same as the nhs budget in england last year so we take no lecture on black hole the fact be that labour have refuse to set pathway to and now we see the consequence cut instead of pathway the secretary of state say that his path to will be fully fund while describe our path to as gimmick our plan be fund by reduce the size of the civil service that be not gimmick it be just something that labour union paymaster will not allow they to do the secretary of state say that defence reform be of little interest to recent defence secretaries if he be talk about ben wallace he be the defence secretary who take the massive decision to provide battlefield weapon to ukraine before russia invade it and to provide it with storm shadow and challenger if he be talk about grant shapps he give his backing in deliver the integrated procurement model fundamental reform of defence procurement that be all about modernisation and that accelerate our procurement of anti drone laser have deliver pay rise for the most junior personnel in we welcome the retention payment however give the cut relate to the royal navy and its staffing pressure will retention payment be offer to non aircraft engineer and will the raf and navy also receive the four year retention bonus if not why not the secretary of state say that we superficially keep bulwark and albion on the book yes we place they in extended readiness but to be clear personally seek and receive assurance from the navy leadership that in the event of full scale warfighting scenario in which the priority for the navy be littoral capability those ship could have be regenerate to condition that enable they to fight and the crew could have be find that be what the navy leadership confirm permanently scrap the landing ship mean remove that capability entirely what impact will that have on the operational effectiveness of the royal marines the multi role support ship be intend to fill the gap but it be at least eight to nine year away be the secretary of state still commit to mrss and if so how many will he procure turn to rotary what will be the operational impact in the immediate term of the puma and chinook decision and what will be the cost of the commercial solution that the secretary of state will use to fill the capability gap in brunei and cyprus as for the conservatives record on rotary the secretary of state know that we secure million of saving by renegotiate the chinook extend range procurement and that personally commence the new medium helicopter competition on the new medium helicopter insist that the procurement should have strong scoring for maintain skilled rotary work in the uk and for exportability to sustain that work can the secretary of state confirm that he will not change the competition and that he be still committed to procure the new medium helicopter without delay will the nmh come into service before those pumas be retire on watchkeeper as the minister who launch the mod first ever drone strategy appreciate that this be an area where we need to move fast and to have the capability to deliver in the modern battle space will the secretary of state be gift any of these capability to ukraine such as the old chinook or the pumas especially give what happen yesterday finally and most importantly what on earth do all this mean for the strategic defence review from the mrss to future drone for the british armed force the secretary of state will no doubt say that should wait for the sdr so why do he not wait for the sdr before make today decision to conclude whatever the chancellor true grasp of economic she have certainly be able to force her priority on to the country get the mod to scrap major capability before it have undertake the department much vaunted strategic defence review the labour government have kill off north sea oil undermine our energy security this week they be kill off the family farm and threaten our food security and today they be scrap key defence capability and weaken our national security the government have make their choice and they own the consequence that be rather wide range response that span the fiscal position in and farming today remind the hon gentleman that the last time this country spend on defence be in under labour and that the tory plan to spend on defence be pre election gimmick announce four week before the election be call and never hardwire into any government finance that be why it be unfunded that be why it be pre election gimmick and that be why the institute for fiscal studies call the plan misleading readily pay tribute to ben wallace as one of my predecessor the hon gentleman talk not about defence reform but about the decision that ben wallace rightly make to step up with military aid to ukraine so that we lead the field and make sure that other country follow suit we be proud to support those decision in opposition and we be proud to continue that uk leadership and to help command the continue united support for ukraine welcome the hon gentleman welcome for the retention incentive which be for aircraft engineer as well as the retention payment for the army rank those payment be for private and lance corporal they stand as have announce they and will start from january be glad of his welcome for the decision take on watchkeeper he do indeed launch drone strategy as defence procurement minister he recognise that we be talk about year old drone in the hand of the british army and that the innovation cycle for drone in ukraine be two to three month we can do well the army know how it will do well and it will replace watchkeeper the hon gentleman also ask question about helicopter the future structure of our force and the capability we need those area be be consider by the strategic defence review as say in my statement make today decision in consultation with the reviewer to make sure that they be align in their thinking and in dialogue with nato the hon gentleman mention hms albion and hms bulwark those ship be mothball there be no plan for either of they to go back to sea for nearly year until they be due to be take out of service they be not ready to sail or to fight there be capability there that can be cover elsewhere that will save we money every year money that we can redeploy in defence and put towards upgrade our force and technology the hon gentleman see the figure before the election that see afterwards he know the truth of the black hole that his government leave across the board but he do nothing in defence to get grip on the budget or to decommission out of date kit be take action now to strengthen defence for the future these decision be overdue and the service chief support these change which mean that we can move more rapidly as we must learn the lesson from ukraine and recognise the change nature of warfare and the rise global threat we have to evolve our equipment and invest in and prepare our force for the future call the chair of the defence committee overall welcome the secretary of state statement today because some of the work to reform the operation of the ministry of defence be long overdue it be right that old platform be retire and that we transition to new equipment be also glad to note that the plan have the full backing of our military chief however this plan be be implement without the full finding of the strategic defence review have be announce and obviously it have cost implication as well as an impact on our people so can the secretary of state advise on couple of thing first will the unrequired kit be either sell to ally or give to ukraine secondly how will our people be reskille and retrain so that there be no job loss as say in my statement the decision have take help we to get grip of the mod budget now and create great scope to well implement the strategic defence review when it report these decision as say be overdue they be duck by ministers in the previous government further decision about what to do with the decommission equipment have not yet be make but when make those decision will ensure that inform my hon friend committee look forward to the grilling that he and his colleague on the committee be set to give tomorrow morning no doubt about this and number of other thing call the liberal democrat spokesperson declare an interest in that my nephew be an aircraft engineer with the royal air force so shall not be comment on the retention payment much as it sound very handsome welcome the emphasis in the statement on defence people legacy of the last conservative government be that there be not enough emphasis on retain brilliant people in the armed force with grant shapps we see defence secretary who be fascinate by technology he come to the house and make statement about dragonfire but miss the very important thing that be slip down the list such as the platform that we hear today be be decommission so welcome the pay rise for personnel and particularly welcome the retention payment for army personnel who have serve for more than four year give that the legacy of capita be an appalling one however there be some alarming gap the new chinook heavy lift helicopter not come in till leave very substantial gap of three year in relation to the chinooks the new medium helicopter contract be not due to be award till next year question when the contract for the new medium helicopter will be introduce perhaps not until the beginning of the next decade the multi role support ship be not due to come into service until be alarmed at what that may do for the ability of the royal marines to operate in the littoral question that the statement say there be full backing from our service chief of course there be they have to salute turn to the right and carry on what be lack be statement about this be do in consultation with the strategic defence reviewer be this statement give their full backing my statement be very clear make these decision in consultation with the strategic defence reviewer it be not for they to back they or not but if the hon gentleman ask they be sure they would say that these be entirely the right decision that they go in the right direction and that they start to make our force more fit for the future these decision be consistent with the direction of our thinking which be why can confidently take they now because we need to create the scope to move fast towards the future once the defence review report we also need to do more to deal with the dire state of the finance that we inherit in defence and across the government the hon gentleman ask about the chinooks this acceleration of their retirement will apply to the old helicopter in fleet of more than some of which be more than year old this mean that the old will be retire at the point when they be due to enter costly maintenance package that will not happen and it mean we can speed up the transition to the new much more capable chinook that will arrive it also mean that we can save money for defence that we can redeploy to other purpose finally very much hope that we can sign up the hon gentleman nephew with the new aircraft engineer incentive payment those need to know in what state the last government leave the armed force should look at the report on readiness for war by the defence committee on which there be conservative majority really welcome the secretary of state statement particularly on waste and on the recruitment and retention of key people in the armed force however on the issue of defence reform can ask he whether in the few month he have be in the job he feel that the mod be fit for purpose be it agile and adaptable enough for the modern oncoming threat we face the short answer to my hon friend question be no which be precisely the reason for the far reach reform that have begin this process will continue expect through my entire time in this post it need to be relentless far reach and radical otherwise we simply will not be able as country to fashion the force we need in the future to be able to fight deter and defend this country say to my hon friend who be one of the lead expert on defence have serve as defence committee member during the previous government that value his view and refer opposition front benchers to the point he make congratulate he on be and wish he well as the leader of the new uk parliamentary delegation to nato wish all the members involve from both houses and from all side successful delegation visit to montreal later this week have know the right hon gentleman for long time and he will know that have high regard for he so simply offer he these word from my knowledge of all the battle one undertake within government always with the treasury put aside for one second any party difference on this we all want functional and ready defensive force able to take on whatever come at we we live in very unstable and dangerous world more dangerous than at any time can recall the government rightly and welcome this set up the strategic defence review to set out the key priority and key threat and it therefore seem reasonable to that we should wait for this report which believe will strengthen the mod arm in future discussion negotiation and battle with the treasury always with the treasury pose this simple question to the right hon gentleman when he feed little bit and piece to the treasury ahead of the review it will come back for more bulwark and albion still have life in they and could have be resurrect mothballing be what the americans use all the time could please suggest that he rethink this process and say to the treasury back off now and when the review be there we can have proper discussion and proper debate appreciate the right hon gentleman tone and his advice on the saving have outline that will flow from the six decommissioning decision that money will be retain in full in defence it will not go to the treasury he link finance to the strategic defence review the prime minister have always be clear since the nato summit in washington in july that it be the strategic defence review first and the pathway to second and the chief secretary to the treasury recently confirm that we should expect that in the spring congratulate my right hon friend and it be good to hear secretary of state finally get to grip with the root and branch reform that we need in the mod want he to cast his mind back to the dossier on waste that we produce in opposition it show that since billion of taxpayer money have be waste by the mod will he commit as he do in that report to root and branch national audit office report on mod waste and to the mod be the first department to be refer to the office for value for money will he also commit to continue to update this house on his ongoing battle against mod waste appreciate my hon friend comment and the reminder to this house of the dossier of defence waste that we do indeed work on together in opposition can confirm to he and the house that have commission an internal audit of waste but have not wait for the result of that have already reduce the consultancy spend by million this year it be set to be balloon billion over three year for consultancy and extra staff have also scrap the tories million vip helicopter contract which be money spend on move vip around the country rather than invest in our servicemen and woman which we can now do this be black day for the royal marines advise the defence secretary that he would do well to have look at the report sunset for the royal marines which be publish by the defence committee in february when the issue of scrap our amphibious assault ship be describe by the cross party committee as militarily illiterate and totally at variance with strategic reality do he accept that the purpose of hms albion and hms bulwark which be due to remain in service for nine and more year respectively be to have the capability of make landing across foreshore when it be oppose by enemy force just as the fearless and intrepid do the job before albion and bulwark do he agree that we have no way of know whether the absence of that capability for the next decade will be an incentive for somebody to try something like the falklands have huge amount of respect for the right hon gentleman he lead the committee that produce an important report but it be six year ago far from it be black day as he say this statement signal bright future which will be reinforce by the sdr for the marines and their elite force on hms albion and hms bulwark he be right that both ship be not due to go out of service for nine and year respectively but neither give the state they be in and decision take by the last government be set to sail again in other word they have in practice be take out of service but ministers have not be willing to admit that our three bay class landing ship and rfa argus for now will continue to provide as they do currently the amphibious capability that will allow we to save at least million year that would have be spend under the previous plan and it will allow we to focus much more strongly on the multi role support ship which promise to have great capability and broad range of ability for the future welcome the secretary of state focus on the future of our force which have be back by the chief and particularly welcome the retention payment for our aircraft engineer and army personnel as other have allude to technology be change the nature of the threat that we face can the secretary of state confirm that this government will work closely with the defence industry to harness new technology to ensure that our force have the kit they need to respond effectively to increase threat can confirm that and welcome my hon friend comment the good exemplification of the argument she make be in the army plan to rapidly replace the watchkeeper mark capability it be year old drone in an era where as ukraine tell we drone technology have lifecycle of two to three month the army know what it can do well it know it can do it more quickly it know how it will focus its effort for the future decommission the watchkeeper mark will allow it well to do that welcome the secretary of state statement and recognise and appreciate that he be do difficult job in dangerous world can seek some clarification on the scrapping of hms bulwark and hms albion we be tell that there be bright future for the royal marines yet at the same time we hear from the government that decision about defence capability will be make in the strategic defence review can the secretary of state tell the house precisely what conversation he have have about the future of the royal marines specifically what do that mean for the uk commitment towards nato to defend the high north the statement mean no change to the available amphibious capability because in practice albion and bulwark have be mothball they be out of action and there be no plan for they to sail again until they be to be take out of service decade into the future this position allow we to focus more quickly on the more modern more flexible capability we will need for the future congratulate the hon gentleman on become member of the defence committee be sure that if he be at the committee sit tomorrow morning he will pursue this matter far bit of this debate should be about honesty if the ministry of defence be to step forward and say we want to modernise and be able to buy kit at scale and at pace but we have limited budget it would just be be honest and realistic to say that we have to let some thing go with my royal marines background first go on bulwark in on training exercise learn how to plan and execute raid operation have fond memory of the ship as do many in the royal marines but that exercise be not conduct at sea it be conduct with bulwark alongside in devonport where it have remain for number of year even then we be tell you will go not on this ship at sea it will not happen people know that at the time so can we be honest on plymouth and devonport where albion and bulwark be and hms westminster which the secretary of state have also mention may ask he how the job and worker in plymouth will be protect with new submarine come forward at huge scale can we talk about the investment in plymouth require order call the secretary of state my hon friend be right that too often decision be duck or parliament be too often not fully inform when they be take the point he make about the experience on bulwark be tell we do not have the capability if it be incapable of sailing we do not have the facility to train effectively on it if all it can do be stay alongside in practice as say early bulwark and albion have be take out of action ministers have just be unwilling to level with the public and with parliament about that understand his interest in the case of plymouth and devonport have be strong supporter in opposition and in government of the team barrow transformation approach there be case for look at replicate similar model in other part of the country for the first in frame would be plymouth what do this announcement tell we about how the strategic defence review be go one lesson of the ukraine war be that old kit can be very useful as my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith say america airfield and dockyard be stack full of old kit for future contingency we be throw away capability that be only out of commission because there be not enough money now the secretary of state be tell we that there be probably even less money please will he not come to this house and pretend he be just clear out an old cupboard of rubbish that everybody have forget about and that the defence chief be hop up and down with delight at his clearing out the hon gentleman have long interest and great expertise in defence over the year have listen to he make the argument that the uk alacrity in dispose of any decommission kit and commitment be strategy that should be review and rethought and be different from that of some other country have make it clear to the house today that the decommissioning decision have be take but what we do with the kit as it come out of service have not yet be settle on the strategic defence review what my decision and announcement tell the house and the hon gentleman be first that people will be at the heart of the plan for the future and secondly that the technology be change at an accelerate pace that imperative will be part of the strategic defence review the lesson of ukraine also tell we that we must have an increasingly integrate force that be reflect in the decision have take today he should expect that to be reflect also in the confirmation and recommendation of the strategic defence review another day another labour minister at the dispatch box clean up the mess leave by the conservative party do the secretary of state agree that the decision outline in today statement will fix the foundation of our nation defence spend every penny he have wisely and keep our nation safe my hon friend be right would add that when inevitably we want to do more than we can afford we must focus our resource on the area of most importance that be the underlie principle that apply to the retention payment for the tri service aircraft engineer lance corporal and other rank in the army after four year service which have be able to announce this afternoon we need they for the future we have train they they have great skill and we want they to have long and more productive career in our armed force servicemen and woman will have listen with despair to the government and the opposition argue about whether the strategic and catastrophic underfunding of the armed force be over the last or the last year either way it result in the situation of defence of the realm that we find ourselves in give the secretary of state announcement today and with one more type to bite the dust can he advise how many escort and frigate will be available subject to the power improvement project on type before type and type be available what about the new medium lift helicopter why be this government move at snail pace as the last government do on new medium lift helicopter what message do the rotary link platform and five royal navy and royal fleet auxiliary ship come out of service send to the outside world what will the strategic defence review do to bolster that situation some million less be be spend on consultant but can the secretary of state advise what the consultancy spend will be now in the mod it will be million less than it would have be before the decision on hms northumberland make no difference to the availability of the royal navy ship at sea because that ship be not capable refit it in its current state as plan could have cost hundred of million of pound that be also behind my decision the process for the medium lift helicopter be under way and continue on recent visit to commando training centre royal marines with the armed force parliamentary scheme we see the amazing gordon messenger facility which serve royal marines their family and veteran it be true community hub and be value by everyone in the service will the secretary of state say more about the support that this government be give to service personnel veteran and their family one of the most important thing that this house never mind the government who introduce the bill have do in the past week be to give its full backing to the second reading of the armed forces commissioner bill this be an independent champion who will improve service life and will be there for those who serve and the family who support they look forward to my hon friend contribution to those debate and congratulate he on become member of the armed force parliamentary scheme which be great scheme know that he will have inspiring experience and will make an even more informed contribution to debate in this house appreciate the constraint on the defence secretary but this statement make mockery of the sdr process it also remove significant line of contingent capability he say that these will not be the last difficult decision that he will have to make and that he be work in lockstep with the sdr so be he and be it roll the pitch for the removal or mothballing of the carrier as have be rumour do he understand what that mean for the future of the royal navy as globally deployable blue water navy give his comment on albion and bulwark be he also roll the pitch for the future of the royal marines since the two be intertwine and will be for the next year before replacement can be provide bulwark and albion be not capability available to the marines at present on the marines have say three time this afternoon that the future of its elite force as part of the complex of what we need for the future will be reinforce in the sdr that be what expect the decision that have announce today be consistent with the sdr he wrongly suggest that somehow these announcement make mockery of it but they be entirely consistent and be take in consultation with the reviewer on the future of carrier in recent week my hon friend the minister for the armed forces and have pay particular attention to the plan for one of those carrier to undertake the carrier strike voyage into the indo pacific where it will have validation exercise with some important ally it be vital part of our ability to reinforce both our hard power and our soft power in future thank the secretary of state for his statement it be clear both from the statement and from the follow up question that the previous government have waste million of pound in defence spending that could have be spend well make it clear that labour be the party of defence that money could also have be spend well in our economy to support the defence sector across the uk what step will the secretary of state take to ensure that future programme will be spend in the uk what guarantee can he offer to support shipbuilding across this country be proud of our tradition of uk shipbuilding include in scotland want britain warship to be build in britain my hon friend may be aware that we be committed to make the government industrial strategy with the defence sector one of those priority sector so that we not only strengthen our force for the future but use defence to strengthen our economy create fresh job and back the innovative company that will have big part to play in both our security and our prosperity the secretary of state present the saving as no brainer the ship be damage and obsolete but in his closing remark he tell we that these would not be the last difficult decision he simply can not have it both way it be all about the messaging in the end what message will be receive from this statement in buenos aires moscow peking and tehran the message be clear we now have government who be willing to take the decision to deal with outdated equipment that should have be retire long ago so that we can switch our focus and our finance and develop the capability technology and weaponry that our force need to fight more effectively in future very much welcome today statement from the secretary of state it be rather gall to hear from opposition members about cut when the previous government big cut be to our armed force to the small size since the end of the napoleonic war in that vein very much welcome the increase in the salary of our armed force the high in year and in particular the retention payment to aircraft engineer and serve armed personnel what message can my right hon friend give to those who be in our armed force and those who be think about career in our armed force that they will have well future if they serve the message be that our uk armed force offer fantastic career wide range of opportunity and skill for any young person who want to sign up that will give they experience and set they up for life my hon friend be totally right when he talk about conservative cut in the first year of labour government we be increase defence spending by nearly billion in the first year of the conservative government in they cut defence by billion if can echo the word of my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith now that the secretary of state treasury minder have leave the chamber he will be able to speak more openly about some of the challenge he face in deal with the treasury appreciate that the secretary of state face really difficult decision and that all these decision will have be incredibly hard to make but will he confirm to the house that the chinooks and the pumas will as first option be at least offer to the ukrainians to see if they can use they in any way at all give the right hon gentleman experience in this very job will take that as an early representation on the future decision will have to take on what to do with the kit once it be decommission the secretary of state rightly say that the mod need reform one of the major failure have be the procurement of equipment which have lead to the wasting of hundred of million if not billion of pound of taxpayer cash will he commit to also reform the recruitment of new personnel into the armed force nobody have good word to say about the outsourcing contract to capita bring it in house will he commit to that the hon gentleman be right procurement be one of the first focus and most important area for further reform in defence but defence reform be require across the board on recruitment hope he will welcome the step have already take to remove almost bit of red tape that prevent young people from be recruit hope he will welcome the tough target for the rapid turnaround in recruitment and an offer of training place hope he will welcome also the direct recruitment route for those who want to join our cyber force as part of reinforce our national security with close social and economic tie between community on both side of the tamar devonport deal be very important to people in south east cornwall and in plymouth will the secretary of state commit to scope devonport deal that look to the future if my hon friend with her south west posse want to come to see to discuss this matter would be very happy to try to arrange that soon the minister of state for defence in the other place early today talk about the world become dark and dark can the secretary of state assure we after the difficult decision he have have to take today that the sdr will be robust and that the defence equipment plan will reflect future threat and the future capability that our armed force will require my hon friend put his finger exactly on the button at the heart of the sdr be an assessment of the increase and diversify threat we face the rapidly change technology and nature of warfare and therefore the capability we require for the future and the sort of force we require for the future those be at the heart of the work the reviewer be do at the moment they be do that in thorough way and at pace expect they to conclude early in the new year while it be deeply disappointing to hear the decision around devonport surface fleet today in particular as the mp for proud home to the royal marines and commando it do provide as have be allude to by some colleague on the labour benches an opportunity to raise again the need for devonport deal and in particular plymouth and devonport role in refit the royal navy submarine go forward as member of that south west posse it be great that the secretary of state have already offer meeting however what we be specifically look for be cross ministerial commitment we be get plenty of meeting but we want to know that the ministers be join up and have conversation cross departmentally and that the devonport deal might be able to offer plymouth and the wide south west future as we see these armed force change regard defence as largely beyond party politic so be happy to extend on cross party basis that invitation to meeting to the hon lady what can not undertake to do be to promise to deliver cross ministerial meeting but if she be happy to start with then that be what we can do as one of number of royal marines on the labour benches really welcome the secretary of state commitment to the royal marines in the forthcoming sdr like my hon friend the member for plymouth moor view fred thomas serve on hms albion but that be year ago think we all recognise that the battlefield have change and that it be important we have the financing available to invest in the technology of the future on reform notice that only two out of major defence programme be on time and on budget at the moment what step be the secretary of state take on defence reform to ensure the failure we see under the previous government can never be repeat my hon friend refer to the regular reporting of the major projects authority the fact that only two out of major defence project can be say to be on time and on budget mean that the department be not deliver effectively for the taxpayer or for our force that be why defence reform far reaching and deep be require welcome my right hon friend statement today it be really good to have secretary of state who be take the long term decision to ensure our military be fit for the future particularly welcome the fact that all personnel affect by today decision will be retrain or redeploy in his first month in the job the prime minister state at the nato summit that we be firmly committed to increase defence spending to that target give that this today final question will he take this opportunity to restate not only that commitment but also our commitment to take the long term decision so that our armed force be equip to ensure that our country be secure at home and strong abroad my hon friend do not just ask about the detail of the statement but cut right to the chase of the purpose of the announcement have make today will reinforce his point the purpose be that we can make britain well defend we can make britain more secure at home and strong abroad that be exactly what this government be determined to do point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker there be now widespread report in the medium of storm shadow missile be use in russian territory for the first time to be clear entirely sympathise with the secretary of state in his reluctance to provide an operational running commentary but equally he will appreciate that once these matter be be report in the medium there may be an expectation among colleague that we will hear more in the house madam deputy speaker have you be give any representation about possible statement on these matter by the ministry of defence thank the hon member for give notice of his point of order as he will believe be aware have be give no indication that the secretary of state will be make such statement but the secretary of state be obviously here and take note of what be be say and if he wish to comment either now or later he have the opportunity to do so far to that point of order madam deputy speaker we have see over recent week significant change in the action and in the rhetoric on ukraine and ukraine action on the battlefield speak for itself we as nation and as government be double down on our support for ukraine and be determined to do more when discuss this with minister umerov in call yesterday he talk about ukraine robust response to recent russian escalation the escalation in the attack on ukrainian city and child the escalation in the attack on the energy system and the escalation that involve deploy north korean troop in combat position on the frontline we also discuss our plan as the uk to support the ukrainians throughout remain committed to keep parliament as fully inform as possible the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge and the house will think understand the reason why at this point be not able to go into any further operational detail trust that that response have satisfy the hon member for south suffolk on point of order madam deputy speaker during prime minister question the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart say that the government have give pay rise to trade union that be factually incorrect the government give pay rise to worker and give they to all worker regardless of whether or not they be member of trade union that be the power of trade union know that it be difficult to educate his majesty official opposition about the benefit of trade union madam deputy speaker but can you advise on whether can compel the shadow minister to come back and correct the record understand that the hon member inform the shadow minister that she be due to make point of order on this issue and thank she for notify we of the point of order she will know that the content of members speech be not matter for the chair if they be would keep they much short but be sure that if the shadow minister inadvertently say anything that be inaccurate he will find way in which to correct the record terminal illness relief of pain motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require the secretary of state to issue guidance about the application of the criminal law in respect of the administration of pain relief by healthcare professional to people who be terminally ill and for connected purpose as we know ten minute rule bill be delicate flower it be almost certainly doom to oblivion because there be no time for second reading debate but it can serve purpose in allow we to demonstrate truth or problem or even just ask question be deliberately propose this bill day before the debate on the terminally ill adult end of life bill the assisted suicide bill because want to highlight real problem there be simply not enough time to consider the immense complexity of this issue before we will be require to make our decision that point will be the subject of joint letter from and the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott to be publish in the guardian tomorrow private member bill may be an appropriate vehicle for an issue that be narrow in scope or involve decision that be relatively clearcut but that be not the case for the assist suicide bill be it government bill which it should be there would be an impact assessment but there be none the bill be much long than almost any other private member bill but it be publish only very recently what will be the impact on the nhs do we not need to know at least one retired judge have question the role of judge should we not know more my bill seek to gain and give the public extra knowledge on one key aspect of this debate what be the state of palliative care in this country what be the option available to assist people in their dying use that phrase advisedly all hospice currently assist people in die as peacefully and painlessly as possible but they do not do that by administer lethal drug so much of the impetus in favour of assist suicide come from an understandable fear of die in pain talk to palliative care nurse and doctor be tell that in nearly every case experienced practitioner can make our pass bearable but would like to know more and think that the public would we would like to know more about the passing of people with degenerative disease demand for palliative care be increase and will continue to do so it be estimate that by one in every four people in england and wales will be over the charity marie curie estimate that by over more people will need palliative care and of course just as individual and family be feel the cost of living crisis our hospice be face high expense hospice uk estimate that hospice face million more in cost in than in the year before research from king college london suggest that more than people in the uk die each year without receive the palliative care that they need and deserve my bill ask the secretaries of state for justice and for health and social care to publish detailed analysis and advice on the law and procedure for instance palliative care nurse tell that if your only motive be to relieve pain you can give as much morphine as you like to patient and you will not kill he or she however also hear that sometimes the pain double but the nurse probably not in hospice but in hospital be unwilling to double the dose for fear of legal consequence hope that if be die of terminal cancer nurse will not hesitate to give as much as necessary be at the deathbed of dear friend and former colleague in the house we be together in hospice could hear the morphine pass gurgle into his wrist he be knock out and his death be peaceful it be clearly good practice we the public need to be tell what the situation be in respect of ensure peaceful death in all condition my bill would be small step forward in take up the debate and inform it the debate in day time could be see as useful airing of the issue and then in year or two we could make measured and well inform decision this be an immeasurably complex issue first there be deeply hold moral and religious concern about the ethic of assist suicide but even if those be of no concern to some people there be practical issue as well the hospice movement be one of our most loving and admired service but we all know that sometimes there be not sufficient experience in some nhs hospital to match the care give in hospice so we need to know more should we not start by build up our hospice movement before we be give binary choice in day time all this be before we even start to consider other issue such as extend the law to other country or pressure be put on old people who feel themselves to be burden there be something else that we that must consider we know that we must provide more funding for the hospice and care home sector but how can we afford it from general taxation we need national debate on new social contract for ballooning frail and elderly population with multiple health need and have long argue that we can only do so with social insurance we have to pay more for our care in old age what we do not want however be pressure for assist suicide for old people because there be not the resource to pay for they again we need much more information about this whole area hope that my intervention today in which be seek more knowledge not just loudly state my own position be helpful and that my bill be useful today receive the following letter from doctor only recently be give my condolence to grieve woman who have lose her husband in the early hour he have be give few small dos of pain relief and mild sedative over the last few night for symptom control and have pass away peacefully at her side she ask in all seriousness doctor do the nurse give he something to make he die quick last night this be an awful linger doubt that she have be able to firmly reassure she that no the medication would not have speed up his passing for she and the vast majority of other patient doctor be there to prolong life and palliate symptom be this to change then we should not be doctor in the eye of many but bringer of death agent of state which count the weak member as expendable and worthy of nothing but an early grave in conclusion hope that my bill and this very short debate will inform discussion on this unbelievably move and delicate matter have dream as we all have that in year to come when our time come we will be give the care that we need but there be so much doubt and uncertainty about that many people quite understandably take position from point of principle they may believe fundamentally from religious point of view in the right to life or they may have libertarian point of view that state that everybody have right to control their destiny but when make this decision probably one of the most important in this parliament it be surely important that we do so from state of knowledge and that we have hospice movement and an nhs that be fully fund to care for our old people so that we can assure all people that in this country this civilised nation we will ensure that everyone pass be as painless and peaceful as possible in that spirit commend the bill to the house question put and agree to order that sir edward leigh rachael maskell sir john hayes danny kruger sir christopher chope sir julian lewis lincoln jopp martin vickers dame meg hillier saqib bhatti helen grant and sir

exchequer and the defence secretary announce that the uk would contribute billion to the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan to ukraine scheme the era this landmark agreement will provide ukraine with total of billion in vital additional funding allow it to continue to fight back against putin war machine crucially these fund will be repay not by ukraine but from the extraordinary profit make on sanctioned russian sovereign asset hold in the european union this bill simply provide the spending authority for the uk to contribute to the era scheme enable we to begin disburse fund to ukraine it be another important demonstration of the uk commitment to back ukraine for as long as it take it will unlock our billion contribution to the era funding which be additional to all previous

mover on military support in particular which range from train over ukrainian military personnel to provide squadron of challenger main battle tank early this year the government announce that the uk would continue to provide guarantee military support of billion per year to ukraine for as long as it take but while we can be proud of what the uk have already do for ukraine members of the house need no reminding that ukraine military budgetary and humanitarian need continue to be grave exist support be not enough we must go far still to ensure that ukraine win this war we must do this alongside our ally the era be an ambitious scheme and represent united pledge with contribution from the united states the european union canada and japan our billion constitute fair and proportionate

be announce our figure have be agree with the and cap have be build into the scheme at level through the eu repayment mechanism although slim this bill be essential royal assent be require before we can begin disburse fund to ukraine and before we can receive any repayment from the profit be hold in the european union it be therefore vital that we pass this bill as quickly as possible so we can begin disbursement this winter as ukraine need be immediate hope that can count on the support of the house to achieve this and help we get this vital money into ukraine hand as quickly as possible the billion collectively deliver through the era lay down marker to show that we will continue to stand with ukraine for as long as it take collectively we will pursue every available mean of make russia pay for the damage it have do in ukraine be proud to present the uk contribution to the scheme today which will make an immediate tangible difference to ukraine capacity to defend itself this bill facilitate that contribution and commend it to the house call the shadow minister before turn to the bill just say that the chief secretary in an early debate kindly welcome to my new role and would like to reciprocate that welcome today he and have work together as member of the business and trade committee which he chair and of which believe you be also member madam deputy speaker we have share desire to use parliament to hold to account fearlessly factually and when need ferociously those who hold authority and power over our constituent he now find himself in such position of authority and power and will hold he to account fearlessly factually and when need ferociously however today be not day for ferocity we welcome this bill it be an important signal of the continue commitment of the united kingdom to the people of ukraine the defence of europe and the achievement of peace through strength we join the tribute to the people of ukraine the man and woman who have have to leave behind their peaceful endeavour in order to stand shoulder to shoulder to defend their land and liberty today we be talk about financial contribution but we should never forget that the great sacrifice be be make each and every day by member of the ukraine military and civilian upon whom putin rocket rain down destruction each and every day under the strong leadership of former prime minister boris johnson the united kingdom lead the world in defend ukraine and since we have pledge more than billion in overall support we be often the first mover on vital lethal aid from storm shadow missile to challenger and main battle tank we impose the large and most severe set of sanction that russia have ever see to cripple putin war machine we sanction around individual company and group and this economic pressure restrict russia ability to prosecute its illegal invasion more broadly we build up formidable sanction regime during our time in office and bring in major new sanction strategy to deter and disrupt malign behaviour and it be pleasing that the current government be continue those effort on behalf of the united kingdom my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak host the ukraine recovery conference last year raise over billion for ukraine recovery and reconstruction this bill take further step forward in our commitment to ukraine and do so alongside our ally it fulfil the united kingdom part of june mandate confirm by finance ministers in washington last month to disburse for the benefit of ukraine approximately billion from the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan or era as the chief secretary term it the united kingdom share be billion and this be earmark as budgetary support for ukraine military spending understand that it will be in addition to the uk exist annual commitment of billion of military aid each loan will be in the form of bilateral loan but will be base on common principle to ensure consistency and co ordination between each loan we support the bill and will support the government if any other party seek to divide this house but would be grateful if the chief secretary or the minister could provide further clarification on several question the first be about disbursement to ukraine under the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan point in the annexe to the statement say loan will be fully disburse to the benefit of ukraine between december and december the whole house will be aware of the current heighten level of military activity and the urgent demand from ukraine for assistance include uk storm shadow missile what discussion have the minister have with the secretary of state for defence about the timing and scale of distribution secondly want to ask about the asset base can the minister update the house on the total value of russian asset seize by the and on the total asset seize by uk jurisdiction the last estimate we have be in march when the total be billion of which billion be seize by uk jurisdiction as the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan refer only to sovereign asset will the minister tell we what consideration be give to the inclusion of income stream from other seize russian asset and why it be determined that they should not be include do the commitment make by each country relate to the amount of russian asset seize or hold by jurisdiction or be they do on some other basis if so what be the basis for those allocation can the minister give some indication of the allocation of seize sovereign asset by type as they be sovereign asset assume that many will be in the form of cash holding but there may be property and other asset it would be helpful for the house to have some understanding of the allocation of these asset by type thirdly want to ask about the use of anticipated income stream from russian asset to repay the loan the bill explanatory note claim the extraordinary profit on the immobilised russian sovereign asset will then be divide between the lender in proportion to their contribution this will happen as the extraordinary profit accrue on monthly basis in three tranche have three similar question on this issue have there be any modelling of the future flow of anticipate income from seized russian asset that will be use to repay the loan have the treasury make an assessment of the expect period for their repayment can the minister provide the house with forecast or estimate for the anticipated revenue available for repayment in each of the tranche fourthly want to ask about contingency there be five participant in the loan agreement the uk the usa canada japan and the eu can the minister advise whether the term of the agreement will still stand if one or more of the participant do not ratify it in the event of peace settlement subsequent to disbursement be make point of the annexe to the era loan initiative say that the outstanding balance that can not be cover by extraordinary profit shall be repay by ukraine to each lender can the minister advise whether that be the case in such circumstance what priority will the repayment of these loan have compare with other loan make to ukraine finally want to ask about the government overall defence expenditure the government budget commit to set out pathway to increase defence spending to of gdp at future fiscal event since then however labour ministers have be unable to confirm whether it remain labour ambition to meet that target by can the minister confirm whether it be still labour policy to increase defence expenditure to of gdp when that might be reach and whether the commitment contain in this bill will be include in such estimate the principle underlie the bill be sound our commitment to the defence of ukraine be reinforce our prayer be with the people of ukraine and the cause of peace and freedom we support the bill we be now day into the russian invasion of ukraine and we be enter crucial period for ukraine and its people with the kursk offensive and administration change in the united states would first like to praise our government for their evolve strong support for ukraine reflect the need on the ground the united kingdom be the first responder and supporter of ukraine the government participation in implement president zelensky point victory plan be very welcome ensure that the war do not last indefinitely and end on fair term be crucial mp of all party work closely on campaign around aid sanction seizure of asset and so much more there be the potential that ukraine could lose of its military aid support from its international ally the uk and other supportive nation struggle to make up the shortfall from our own store if this remain the case ukraine will slowly lose the ability to defend itself russia will increase and intensify its atrocity across the country where will russia stop the increase rhetoric from the kremlin need robust response it have be show again and again to take advantage of perceive weakness now day into the russian invasion of ukraine we can take the first step in unlock frozen russian asset to support ukraine welcome today bill which will ensure that the loan make will be repay with the russian state asset currently freeze in the uk the must act collectively on this at the start of the war approximately billion of russian central bank reserve be freeze in the west we need route to mobilise these reserve we must understand how other state have be able to disclose the amount of russian central bank reserve they hold we need to know how many billion of pound of russian reserve reside in the city of london canada have pass the special economic measures russia regulations which collect datum on russian asset freeze they and publish the value which currently stand at billion canadian dollar freeze in canada can the government move to disclose the level of russian asset hold here in similar way also wish to call for the seizure of russian central bank reserve to pay for the defence of ukraine many government be seize the profit generate from the frozen money and use that to back ukraine the us have pass legislation give the president the power to do that and welcome this legislation which will move we in the same direction in the uk we also have billion freeze from the sale of chelsea football club if unlocked it could create the second wealthy charity in britain but it remain frozen in uk bank account can the minister outline what step he be take to immediately release this funding which would provide much need humanitarian aid to ukraine in ukraine winter be not come winter be here we must decide on route to mobilise the uk seizure of russian asset the estimate cost of reconstruction in ukraine be at least billion over the next decade and grow every day we must begin the process of confiscate the russian central bank reserve in the uk with this bill defend ukraine democracy be defend our democracy look forward to the potential of this bill to be route to mobilise billion of pound of russian central bank reserve can the minister clarify the position on whether the loan in the bill today will be in the form of recourse or non recourse loan the financial assistance to ukraine bill allow the uk to fulfil our commitment make in the june loan agreement to ukraine the uk expect contribution under this agreement be approximately billion which ukraine can decide to utilise for its defence we have russian central bank deposit in the bank of england as well as russian bond that have mature and the fund deposit in uk commercial bank can the minister outline when we will legislate to seize these asset for the defence and reconstruction of ukraine as they dwarf the sum we be debate today conclude by again thank ministers in the treasury the foreign commonwealth and development office and the ministry of defence for their stalwart support of ukraine slava ukraini call the liberal democrat spokesperson james maccleary yesterday ukraine enter its day since the start of russia illegal and unprovoked invasion and it be about to enter its tough winter yet this bill represent significant and welcome step in provide much need financial support to ukraine as it continue its courageous resistance it will deliver tangible assistance during this critical phase of the conflict provide vital lifeline to our ukrainian ally before the war my partner and have the good fortune to travel in ukraine visit both kyiv and odesa we visit modern city similar to any other in europe so the sight of ordinary ukrainian family be force at the start of the russian attack to shelter in the kyiv underground station that we have both so recently use for sightseeing in that beautiful city be both shocking and move for we it also bring home why the uk unwavere support for ukraine be so essential not just for the brave people of that nation but for all of we if liberal democratic nation do not stand together against tyranny and aggression the tyrant will feel no constraint and the citizen of other european nation include potentially the uk might find that they be the one force into underground station look for shelter the liberal democrats support this bill and its intent but we be disappointed that it have take so long to come to the house my noble friend lord purvis of tweed raise this issue back in january some month ago but now the bill be finally here we be pleased to see that it demonstrate commitment to ensure that those responsible for ukraine devastation russia and its oligarch elite should at the very least contribute financially to ukraine recovery however we believe the bill do not go far enough the uk should consider seize all frozen russian asset not just their profit and redirect they to aid ukraine with around billion worth of such asset currently hold in the uk alone the government be miss significant opportunity to amplify their support distinguished international lawyer have make strong case for this step although some economist have express concern about repercussion in the financial market we believe that give the very specific circumstance of this conflict the justification and the benefit far outweigh those concern such action would provide an immediate and substantial financial boost to president zelensky force and ukraine reconstruction effort while send clear message to the kremlin that aggression against sovereign nation will have severe and lasting consequence we therefore also back the call for special tribunal to prosecute those responsible for russia war of aggression and to ensure accountability for the heinous crime commit the liberal democrats have consistently call for the uk to lead by example in support ukraine extend it beyond financial assistance to include military diplomatic and humanitarian measure the provision of advanced weaponry include long range precision arm be critical to ukraine success we must also bolster british arm and ammunition supply work closely with our ally to replenish stockpile and maintain ukraine defensive capability it be essential that we co ordinate effectively with nato and the european union to maximize collective impact which be why urge the government to be bold in their effort to rebuild our relationship with the eu include by deepen our security and military co operation we urge the government to build an international consensus for the proscription of the wagner group whose activity represent grave threat to international security the uk must also take strong stance against russia continue human right violation and support anti war activist within russia many of whom face persecution for their bravery offer asylum to such individual and raise their case in international forum be not only moral imperative but strategic mean of undermine the kremlin control it be vital to recognise that support ukraine financially and militarily should not come at the expense of other nation in need restore the gross national income target for international development spending be crucial step towards ensure that humanitarian aid to ukraine do not result in the neglect of our wide global responsibility the government failure to meet this target undermine britain reputation as global leader in development and humanitarian support the liberal democrats also urge the government to take robust action to close the loophole in economic crime legislation that have allow putin ally to funnel dirty money through the uk for far too long financial times investigation publish yesterday reveal that company in british overseas territory export million worth of good to russia in potentially breach uk sanction aim at restrict access to military and high tech supply call on the minister to give an undertaking that the government will look to address these violation and close these loophole the national crime agency must be properly resource to tackle economic crime effectively and magnitsky sanction should be use to target relative and associate who attempt to evade exist measure this be about far more than financial probity it be about stand up for the rule of law and ensure that our financial system can not be use to bankroll aggression this bill come at moment of uncertainty the possibility of diminished us support for ukraine follow the recent election and the imminent return of donald trump to the presidency be deeply concern should the united states falter in its support europe must step up this should serve as wake up call for the uk government to lead in europe by seize frozen russian asset reverse damaging cut to our armed force and strengthen co operation with both nato and the european union on security and foreign policy with hard winter ahead time be of the essence the uk must not waver in its commitment to ukraine this be about more than financial assistance it be about justice accountability and the preservation of international law this bill be vital step forward but it must not be the final word we must demonstrate bold leadership by act decisively to ensure that ukraine not only survive but prevail and that the principle of sovereignty freedom and democracy endure let this bill be the beginning of renewed and united effort to support ukraine by seize frozen russian asset provide advanced military support and work closely with our ally we can help ukraine to secure last victory and ensure future of peace stability and justice for europe and beyond let we rise to this challenge for ukraine for europe and for the value we hold

responsible for send here who thank greatly and promise to serve in the spirit of the amber valley motto per laborem progress through hard work pay tribute to the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for her excellent maiden speech she speak movingly and touchingly about her father and about dementia and it be theme that we must come back to in this house it be really profound also share her admiration for nigel mills who be an excellent predecessor and she be very magnanimous in her comment about he will be sure to see she in the tea room to hear more about derbyshire hopefully she will not be dictate that drink mojito because can not bear they understand that the financial assistance to ukraine bill be be steer through the house by the treasury quite right too but think it would be worth my saying at the outset why the bill be positive development in security defence and foreign affair in december amid the build up of russian troop on the border of ukraine vladimir putin write two letter he write one to the united states and one to nato his demand include russian veto on nato membership for ukraine and the imply removal of us nuclear weapon from europe and the withdrawal of multinational nato battalion from poland and from the baltic state of estonia latvia and lithuania that would have be completely and utterly unacceptable and we can only surmise why he might have want nato to act in this way it be because once ground be take it be that much hard to take back offence be so much more costly than defence it be to the issue of cost that we must now turn the purpose of the bill be to support the billion initiative launch in june which represent co ordinate effort by the and the eu to support ukraine however with hungary potentially block concerted eu action welcome the provision in the bill that will ensure that future financial assistance extend to any change in subsequent arrangement in case we can reach broad consensus later it be crucial that we collaborate with our eu partner to swiftly advance the agreement the minister talk about the uk be first mover in this space which be very welcome although state such as estonia finland and czechia work on it prior to we and canada have be driver of it too the uk billion contribution to the arrangement reflect our gdp share but as leader in support ukraine feel we need to go beyond simply proportional share after all do so could provide support for ukraine in place of some taxpayer money it be welcome that the uk be contribute billion annually and the government have pledge to maintain that for as long as it take but as zelensky say why should western taxpayer foot the bill when frozen russian asset could be confiscate and give for use by ukraine the bill be positive step but we should talk about not just future profit generate from frozen russian asset but the principle the asset themselves the approach set out today use only fraction of the billion available much of which be hold at euroclear central security depository to support ukraine effectively we must go far we should repurpose all these asset not just the profit but the principle some critic argue that confiscate the fund would pose legal risk they talk about sovereign immunity an argument that be also use by some who oppose the prosecution of leader for the crime of aggression but sovereign immunity should also apply when think about the sovereignty of state legally we have to think about how russia violate international law it violate the un charter and blatantly breach the charter principle of state sovereignty it be estimate that russia have already cause billion worth of damage that be what will be require to rebuild ukraine and russia will ultimately have to pay to make good that damage but what use will the frozen asset be to ukraine if ukraine no long exist the goal can not be only to rebuild ukraine from the rubble but to help ukrainians prevent their country from turn to ash some argue that confiscate the asset could destabilise global market or deter other nation from hold reserve in western financial institution in the future but those fear be overstate and need to be weigh against the risk of do nothing the dominance of western financial system remain robust alternative such as china renminbi lack the stability and scale of the us dollar cryptocurrencie be too volatile to be viable alternative so the risk of inaction should be think of in term of what have happen in global market since the full scale invasion of ukraine in there be very wobbly period include here in the uk with the liz truss mini budget which be partly about support people with their energy bill at the time the government feel that they have to provide such support because of the rise in the price of gas cause by russia illegal invasion of ukraine again we can not just suppose that do nothing will have no consequence there be concern that confiscation could reduce our leverage in future peace negotiation but this war first need to be win this be not the gulf war in when frozen asset be use to compensate kuwait this war be still not determined other state consider invest in western institution have nothing to fear if they have no intention of invade their neighbour as thing stand russia have show little interest in meaningful dialogue to simply wait and keep the asset as negotiating tool be naive and defeatist by repurpose the asset now we not only support ukraine immediate need but reinforce the principle that aggression must not pay and that nuclear sabre rattle be completely unacceptable as the liberal democrat spokesperson my hon friend the member for lewes james maccleary say the geopolitical context underscore the urgency of the moment trump comment in march that he see us isolationism as attractive when talk to the hon member for clacton nigel farage on gb news he say we have an ocean in between some problem nice big beautiful ocean with the united states face question about whether its support for ukraine could be reduce or even diminish we need to think far about what more we can do with our european ally act now to unlock the full potential of russian asset would provide ukraine with financial lifeline insulate it from shift in political will elsewhere in the world the bill highlight the importance of collaboration with our european partner as the shadow chief secretary to the treasury the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller point out uk taxpayer have already contribute over billion in aid to ukraine since february but our absence from eu defence framework limit our ability to co ordinate effectively with those european ally we could use some of the confiscate frozen asset to support joint procurement perhaps associate with some of the framework such as the european defence agency shared management of those confiscate fund would ensure transparency accountability and maximum impact the future profit fund suggest as base for the bill be schedule to be disburse between december and that timeline do not match the urgency of ukraine need just last weekend we see russia large attack on ukrainian infrastructure in month russia launch missile and drone three week ago the finnish government take bold step by confiscate billion in russian asset make finland one of the first country to take decisive action the finnish confiscation must surely be hit russia where it hurt and we should follow the example set by finland czechia and estonia work together to confiscate those russian asset include the principal not just the interest the stake could not be high ukraine fight be fight for eastern europe and the west more broadly it be fight for the principle of democracy sovereignty and international law that underpin global peace and security welcome the bill but it be vital that the provision align with the goal of confiscate all russian asset to support ukraine financially let we rise to the challenge demonstrate solidarity with ukraine and show leadership on the global stage and unwavere friendship to our european ally by collaborate with those european ally to confiscate russian asset we can help pave the way for an outcome that make it plain to any government who be watch that aggression do not pay it be pleasure to have hear the beautiful maiden speech of my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth whose father must be really proud it be excellent to hear the detail of the bill but russia continue assault on ukraine be absolutely terrifying we must not buy into narrative of peace on russia term that would be tantamount to appeasement sovereign democratic country cede territory to an aggressive imperial country basically take we back to world war two an idea that find absolutely terrifying it would completely embolden putin and eastern europe and the baltic would be next on his target list it be completely right to say that defence of the uk start in ukraine we be do everything we can to support ukraine it be great to hear about the ukrainian troop who have be train by the uk through operation interflex and be glad that that policy be be extend it be excellent to hear about the military support that we be provide to ukraine include the storm shadow missile that we be hear about in the medium at the moment train on those weapon and hope that they can help to take the fight to the russians it be also excellent to hear that we be provide financial support of billion as well as an additional billion from interest on seized russian asset unfortunately day since the invasion of ukraine the russian economy be despite sanction do well than many of we expect at the start of the conflict however the russians do face challenge include the high casualty rate since the conflict begin high interest rate and now labour shortage in the russian economy we must sustain our support for ukraine and increase the pressure on russia which can not be allow to succeed the bill be an important step in sustain our support for ukraine the billion will help ukraine to invest in air defence artillery and other military equipment fully support the bill but have couple of question for the minister what more can be do to seize frozen russian asset think in particular of the billion from the sale of chelsea football club and other asset that must be hold in the city of london we must use everything in our arsenal and would like the uk government to do more to seize and use such asset rather than use just the interest as we be committed to do at the moment will she confirm whether this be non recourse or recourse loan it be important that if the interest from russian asset be not what we expect it to be there be no expectation on the ukrainians give all the difficulty that they be face to repay the bill add my congratulation to the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth on her maiden speech it be so lovely to hear about her family be encourage to hear about her revolutionary constituent who be keen on parliamentary reform they will certainly have plenty of support from scottish national party member in those ambition thank the minister for bring the bill to the chamber we be now day on from the full scale invasion but it have be well over year since russia initial invasion of ukraine reassert first minister john swinney acknowledgment of that anniversary yesterday and the continue commitment to ukraine of my party and the scottish government this issue cut across the chamber and it be good to see so much unanimity on it why be that important because the ukrainians be fight for each and every one of we who value democracy liberty and independence across europe they be the frontline defend we and those we represent as well as our friend and colleague around europe sometimes it be easy to lose sight of that the bill be about aid ukraine but it be also about invest in our own security this be national security issue and it be good investment for we let we think for moment about the consequence of not supply arm and provide finance to ukraine it would mean collapse and one of the bad refugee crisis that europe have ever experience it would mean hit to the rule base system which suspect those of we who believe in that system would see as difficult to recover from bluntly it would mean broadening of the war vladimir putin be not stop in ukraine in the same way that he do not stop in georgia chechnya syria libya you name it although we be absolutely supportive of the bill which certainly have my party support will pick up on couple of point that have be raise on which clarification would be helpful agree with the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for lewes james maccleary who say that this bill do not go far enough from an arm and security perspective we often provide supply to ukraine that allow it to fight and not lose the war but not to win it that go for the arm and the finance be supply will pick up on point make quite rightly by the hon member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord there be billion worth of frozen asset know that the minister will not be able to pick up on this today and it be not part of the bill but encourage she to come back to the chamber at some point and provide we with an update she will find that she have support across the chamber know that this issue be not easy and be about build link with other partner and there will be some resistance to that but the amount of money in the bill which acknowledge be an important contribution be dwarf in scale by the amount of finance that it could provide by unfreeze those asset the hon member for honiton and sidmouth also make point about sovereign immunity russia give up its sovereign immunity when it launch the full scale invasion and therefore force this war on the sovereignty of ukraine we also have the principle of the universality of certain crime and we have see allegation about universal crime commit in ukraine with very substantial evidence that be obviously matter for the international criminal court but encourage lawyer to look into the principle of universality on some of the issue in that area know that the minister be sympathetic and that this be not entirely as simple as many of we would like it to be but from the comment we have hear from across the chamber there appear to be great deal of support for the unfreezing of those asset it would be fantastic to see the uk government provide leadership in that area also point to the fact that we have see fantastic leadership from the czechs estonians and finns what make their leadership so compelling be that they know what happen if we give in to russian aggression they know at first hand and have generational knowledge within live memory of what happen when we give in to this kind of aggression encourage the minister to look into that and endorse the point make about the sale of the proceed from chelsea football club which be also very significant that billion would be transformative in help ukraine to fight this war for all of we also ask the minister about the broad finance issue of the effectiveness of sanction we know that russia have be able to get around sanction but we must redouble our effort make reference to report that be involve in writing when sit on the foreign affairs committee which be on moscow gold and dirty money there be allegation about some of that money be go through london refer the minister treasury colleague to have look at that it be very good bit of work undertake on cross party basis this issue be crucial my final point be that our time be limited we have new administration come in in the united states in january and we know that the sign be not entirely promising in term of the support that we have see from the united states in recent year this war should actually have be wake up call to all of we in europe year ago give the fact that we have have this election in the united states we be very late to the party on this issue but we have huge responsibility to pull together as europeans the ukrainians be on the frontline and deserve our support this be an investment in our own security absolutely support the bill but we need to go that little bit far congratulate my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth on her fantastic maiden speech she be really powerful advocate for her constituent she talk movingly about her father lose his voice but she have certainly find hers in this place be with she on that visit to ukraine in september and still find it incredible that in this day and age in it be possible to visit the capital city of fellow democracy on the european continent and hear air raid siren and see civilian woman and child head for air raid shelter that be the dystopian future that vladimir putin have set out for ukraine in this terrible war but also potentially for the rest of the continent if we do not get our act together several time this afternoon hon member have make the powerful point that this be an existential war for the people of ukraine they be not fight for some unforeseeable future but to ensure their national independence and preserve their sovereignty some million ukrainians be live under occupation at the moment and the people of ukraine know what the full occupation of their country would entail the destruction of their national life and of their liberty we know this because despite vladimir putin mendaciousness he have set out time and again his historical worldview his perverted sense of world history and russian revanchism there be the essay that he publish just before the invasion and the strange speech he give on the eve of the invasion itself in which he basically posit the idea that ukraine be not real country well it have very much prove to be real country and it have defeat he in his evil ambition for the past two year because this war be existential and because it be crucial for the defence of this country we have duty to be realistic do not expect ministers to comment on this today but we in this chamber be all very much aware that there have be sea change in american politic and that the comment from people who will either be part of the future administration or be likely to be part of it suggest that the united states support for ukraine might not be what it have be that bring to the issue that the hon member for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins mention which be that we be run up against the clock we have limit time we have to be realistic there be new administration come in so europe have to pick up the slack and provide great leadership however we be also see massive change in europe on the day that president trump be elect the german government begin to fall apart and in france we be see presidency stumble towards the end of its term the united kingdom be the country that have to provide the leadership in europe on these matter as it have do since the start of the war but we need to go even far the support that ukraine get at the moment be already subject to so many restriction it have be drip feed to they over the past two year rather than give they what they need right away which have potentially make the war long we have not give the ukrainians the tool they have need when they have ask for they ukrainian talk about the long yes where european partner say yes of course and promise delivery of arm but those arm take month or even year to arrive and make difference on the battlefield wonder whether we would be in different place if all the system that have eventually be give to ukraine have be give at the start of the war this bill be absolutely crucial as various member have say and support it think it be extremely important but member have also talk about go far with russian asset can completely understand why year or month ago it might have be rational to think that those asset could be use during the peace negotiation that they could potentially be the source of funding for rebuild ukraine however as member have point out several time there may not be ukraine if this war be not win that be why we have to give serious consideration to unlock those fund and use they now for the defence of ukraine the last time this country be fight for its life in there be also presidential election we be much lucky back then because both the democratic and republican candidate be stalwart ally of the uk in its fight against fascism this election have change thing but go back to that time when president roosevelt announce lend lease he say that when your neighbour house be on fire you do not haggle over the cost of the hose you give they the hose you give they what they need to put out the fire and then you go back to the detail later that be the attitude european partner should have towards the defence of ukraine early today mention that one of the defence ministers have say that the world be become dark every day if this war be not win the world will be plunge into darkness because it will send an incredibly dangerous message to other autocracy around the world about the rule base order and might be right and the refugee crisis that we see here in europe at the moment will pale into insignificance as million of ukrainians flee the prospect of live under vladimir putin tyranny as such welcome this bill but like many colleague hope to see britain leadership continue to grow and for we to go far seize russian asset and give the ukrainian people what they need too start by congratulate the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth every time hear someone give maiden speech in this chamber be really hearten by the passion and expertise of the new intake as say in my maiden speech it be clear that we be go to have not just good parliament but great parliament look forward to it very much welcome the minister speech and the bill as be usual on ukraine there be agreement across the house be not quite expect this degree of agreement on go far on not just seize interest or make loan but go after asset this bill fulfil the uk part of an agreement that the make in june and we of course want to fulfil our commitment however the commitment in that agreement be make before the recent election in the us as many member across the house have say include most recently the hon member for macclesfield tim roca the security calculus that europe have apply for the last year have now change we can no long rely on an american security umbrella nato be the cornerstone of our defence there be no disagreement about that in the house the government talk of nato first but nato do not work without an american security guarantee american logistic or the american backbone that run through it it be the same with ukraine since the outbreak of the war in february the united states have provide approximately of the support for ukraine the uk lead that be something that the previous right hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip get absolutely right however we now face world in which that support may be withdraw and that be not just supposition president elect trump have say that the russians can do whatever the hell they want in europe this be huge problem we should have wake up to this five or year ago the fact that we be deal with it now well hope we be should arouse the interest of member in the chamber today want to outline what the consequence may be of withdrawal of us support from ukraine we may end up with grubby little deal that would involve take marker pen and draw through ukraine on map the problem with that be that this war be not about territory those who understand it to be about territory misunderstand it it be about identity russia see ukraine as part of its imperial identity if ukraine exist as an independent country then russia do not exist as an imperial country it be that simple we be try to define the conflict by way of territory but that it be not how vladimir putin see it we may end up with grubby deal in effect the us will withdraw support and ukraine will be force to come to the negotiating table line will be draw on the map through kharkiv donbas and kherson however vladimir putin will not stop there latvia lithuania and estonia be all ally of our that the united kingdom have pledge to defend through nato under article if putin take bite from lithuania and britain and france step forward to defend it as we be pledge to do under article we would have huge problem if we then hear from washington that the us would not follow we even if we do not get grubby deal that empower vladimir putin we could end up with the collapse of the ukrainian frontline if the americans withdraw their support and the ukrainians decide to fight on if be ukrainian would fight on because of what the russians do in bucha and their kidnapping of ukrainian child the ukrainians may fight on but the frontline may collapse the hon member for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins speak about refugee crisis the un in kyiv recently carry out study of the crisis that could follow collapse of the ukrainian domestic power system as we know the russians be target it at the moment the un estimate that between million and million ukrainians would leave and move into western europe and that be just on the collapse of the power system what would occur if the frontline collapse and the murderous genocidal russian army start to rampage through western ukraine if we step outside europe and look at possible consequence of ukrainian defeat we can see that the idea of nuclear proliferation be keep under wrap which we have cherish for the past or year would be under threat the lesson we learn from the conflict be that if state have nuclear weapon it can bully its way into invade other state iran and other country will see this and think that be something we need to get colleague have mention other autocratic state china be watch what be happen in ukraine carefully as well as the western european and american response if we lose in ukraine we can kiss goodbye to taiwan this be an existential conflict for ukraine in which it must succeed the bill go some way to help with that but not far enough the west collectively have billion of russian asset some billion of those be in belgium in euroclear to put that in context the us have to date donate or pledge to donate approximately billion to ukraine so the total amount of russian asset we hold be more than the total spend so far from the united states on the war give that we may well be lose us support for ukraine with all the second order effect that have for our security why be we not consider much more carefully sequestering and use those asset for the defence of ukraine if not now when may start by congratulate my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth on her excellent maiden speech have hear that former crown prosecutor can go far in this place and be sure that she will rise to speak in strong support of the bill and be grateful to colleague for show their support for it because it be essential to the uk continue steadfast support for ukraine as it defend itself against russia illegal and brutal invasion through the bill the labour government will ensure that fund derive from sanctioned russian sovereign asset asset that be once use to fuel putin war machine will help ukraine in its fight for freedom that be not only morally right but in britian national interest as so many hon member have say support ukraine mean support the frontline of our democracy and our share value of liberty and self determination most member of the house recognise that it be critical to stand with ukraine but be deeply disappointed that some question our unwavering support some have suggest that concession should be make on both side in this war as if there be some kind of equivalence between ukraine fight for its freedom and russia criminal and illegal invasion let we be absolutely clear that call for concession send the wrong message to ukraine the world and future generation these call undermine ukraine sovereignty reward putin recklessness and disregard the horrific suffering that have be inflict on the ukrainian people the hon gentleman be right to mention what the future hold we all want peace ukrainians above all but that peace must be base on justice and we in this house must commit to that the message from this house today should not be about the ukrainians under pressure from russian troop but about our commitment in this house to they we can influence the united states president to ensure that thing look more positive for ukraine do the hon member agree that that have to be the message that we send from this house now have parliamentary medal have take an intervention from the hon member for strangford jim shannon be grateful and agree with what he say some of the view that we hear be dangerous form of appeasement that only embolden the aggressor and undermine the cause of peace freedom and democracy that weaken ukraine our position and the value that we in this house should defend we must reject such defeatism and appeasement and we must stand firm in the face of tyranny for ukraine and for the value that we hold dear in this democracy to do anything less be to surrender our ideal and that be not an option the bill demonstrate that this government be commit to do the opposite it build on our already substantial support include billion in annual military aid and billion in additional funding draw from immobilised russian asset it also enable the uk billion contribution to the extraordinary loan scheme this funding will directly support ukraine defence by provide vital air defence system artillery and armoured vehicle that support be vital not only for ukraine but for the security of the uk and the wide world as the chief secretary to the treasury rightly highlight safe and secure ukraine mean safe and secure united kingdom it be testament to our country leadership on the global stage and point of pride that the issue have have cross party support in this parliament the prime minister commitment to continue military aid and the uk role in drive the large sanction package ever impose on major economy reflect our iron clothe determination to hold russia to account putin be now day into war that he think would last just few his miscalculation have drain russia economy of its annual budget be now consume by the war effort his force have suffer their high rate of casualty since the conflict begin this be no time for we to falter pay tribute to the bravery of the ukrainian armed force and the crucial work of the uk armed force in train their ukrainian counterpart let say how proud be of our troop vital contribution to ukraine defence effort pride that be reinforce by my visit to the regiment royal logistic corps and the commando training centre royal marines see their dedication at first hand be reminder of the professionalism and commitment of our armed force who be make tangible difference in ukraine fight for freedom the unity of this house our government and our ally be essential to ensure that ukraine have the resource that it need to prevail let we send clear message today britain will stand with ukraine for as long as it take congratulate my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth on her wonderful maiden speech actually have actually shift up to sit in her spot so that can accept all the plaudit that be come from other yesterday mark day since the start of russia

must be able to move on with their life in peace without fear of be bombard the bill provide the government with the spending authority to provide an additional billion in financial assistance to ukraine pay for not by the british taxpayer but through the extraordinary profit make on immobilised russian sovereign asset many of my rushcliffe constituent will welcome this very serious and sensible proposal which give ukrainians more tool to defend themselves and would join some of the call today to look at way in which we may be able to go still far trust that the house will join in pay tribute to the ukrainian armed force who be fight so valiantly to defend their country and their democracy and to the member of our uk armed force who be involve in train ukrainian armed force in

by those who be willing to say in this house and anywhere else where speech be free that vladimir putin be an illegitimate tyrant it be fight by those inside russia who stand or seek to stand in

be present today be relatively new to the house and do not think will ever forget the first time walk into the chamber with that real sense of awe that we have when we walk in here we be face with the history of this place which stretch back for century the idea that have be debate discuss and decide in this room but we be on the next page this debate and the debate that we will have over the come month and year be the next step on that journey the next page of that history and as we move forward we must continue to remember our place in the story story of the importance of democracy and the importance of ordinary people stand up have their say and ensure that idea such as democracy justice and self determination be never forget and be always close to the forefront of what happen in this place in this country and around the world we should be proud of the history of this place in defend those ideal as be proud of this country support for ukraine be also proud of the support from

write what do we want it to say know that when play my part in that want it to say that be on the right side of history on the side of our value justice and democracy that be why support the bill so that we can provide support to ukraine more than that want to be part of send message message nato message european message to washington about the importance of support ukraine and part of send very strong message to moscow and its supporter in tehran pyongyang and anywhere else that support this illegal war in ukraine that it have to stop but it can only stop with ukrainian victory slava ukraini we now come to the front benchers start with the shadow minister will respond briefly to the debate for the opposition first commend all the speaker and particularly the hon member for amber valley linsey farnsworth it be rare for so many in this house to congratulate member on their maiden speech but it be warrant because she speak so nicely and kindly about her constituency as well as with great generosity about her predecessor and very movingly about her father she should take away the great support from all member across the house and we wish she the good of luck in her future here the minister will be aware have listen to the debate of the comprehensive support for the bill she will have hear call from some quarter to extend the provision of the bill to include seize not only proceed from the profit but the asset such move would be very large step for the uk to take and do not think the official opposition would support that without very strong convincing from the government but on all the other aspect she will have see the comprehensive support on the seizure of asset and the billion we be try to make the point that this need to be explore very seriously it would be transformative for the ukrainian war effort and would therefore be transformative for our security take on board the hon gentleman point that this be not easy and about the impact that it might have however will he join in encourage the treasury to look at this and come back to we with further detail about the possible implication and how it might take this forward so that we can all as house examine it in great detail think can assure the hon gentleman that the treasury look at these option on continue basis but consistently the point of view hold by the previous government and would assume by the current government be that that be not the right step to take but perhaps the minister will update the house on her view on that in moment give the support there be the opportunity for the government to move forward with all stage of the bill so that it could proceed and be complete in this house today will the minister say why that decision be not make and perhaps provide some sense of the timetable for when the bill will be bring to the house for its concluding stage but the opposition general message be that we fully support the intention of the bill and we will support it on second reading it be pleasure to close this debate on what remain very important and press issue as ukraine enter yet another difficult winter be proud of the consistent support that this government have show through not just our billion era contribution but the long term commitment we have make to support ukraine capacity for self defence join the opposition spokesperson the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller and my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury along with my hon friend the member for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier and for gateshead central and whickham mark ferguson in say how proud be that there be unity across the house in stand shoulder to shoulder with ukraine at this very difficult time this be complex issue and will try to answer the question pose by the opposition and my hon friend if have miss out anything be happy to write to member before get into the nitty gritty of the bill pay tribute to my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for make such powerful maiden speech think be right in say that her late mother margaret david martin and all her child would be extremely proud of their extraordinary daughter mother stepmother and wife very much welcome this vicious dictator to the house we need more of they in the woman parliamentary labour party so be pleased to have she here the hon member for north bedfordshire ask about the timing of the release of the fund we intend to begin spend the fund early next year to ensure that the funding support our ukrainian ally as soon as possible we intend to do so in three equal tranche over three financial year start in and the have agree that all era fund will be give out by the end of he also ask about how the uk will be repay we be provide the funding as part of the wide extraordinary revenue acceleration loan initiative which mean that the uk will be repay via the extraordinary profit generate from immobilised russian sovereign asset in the eu the eu have already enact the necessary regulation to operationalise the ukraine loan co operation mechanism which will distribute the profit that come into effect on october as he be probably aware the hon member ask about what will happen to the uk if the loan be not repay the repayment will rely on profit continue to flow from immobilised rsa into the eu over multiple year the uk and the wide have commit to ensure that russian sovereign asset remain immobilised across our jurisdiction until russia cease its war of aggression and pay for the damage that it have cause to ukraine and lender have work closely together to design the era in way that allow for repayment in scenario in which profit cease and russia pay ukraine hope that answer his question but can write to he if he want more detail on nato spending target there be clear commitment from the government to spend of our gdp on defence which have categorically not change the hon member will have see in our manifesto that we will set up path towards spend of gdp on defence and this will be do at future fiscal event the hon member ask about the total value of asset and private asset between february and october billion worth of russian asset be freeze due to uk financial sanction regulation marked increase on the figure of billion that be provide in the office of financial sanctions implementation annual report in ofsi be currently analyse datum on immobilised asset and on the type and value of the asset like many member the hon member for lewes james maccleary ask about the involvement of the era in asset seizure have to make it clear that the era scheme do not represent the seizure of russian sovereign asset in any way it be about use the extraordinary profit that the eu have set aside to pay series of loan to ukraine he and the hon member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord ask about seize russian sovereign asset in the uk russia obligation under international law be clear it must pay for the damage it have cause to ukraine the agreement to use the profit from immobilised russian sovereign asset for the loan be an important step towards ensure that russia pay although we continue to consider all lawful avenue by which russia be make to meet its obligation to ukraine under international law it be important that the uk and the remain focused on deliver the era and the benefit that it will give to ukraine right now because we be very conscious of the situation in which the country find itself few other member include my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel ask about the proceed from the sale of chelsea fc the government be work hard to ensure that the proceed from the sale of chelsea reach humanitarian cause in ukraine as quickly as possible my hon friend might know that the proceed be currently freeze in uk bank account while new independent foundation be establish to manage and distribute the money but this be something that we be work on and we be try to move it along as quickly as possible my hon friend the member for halesowen alex ballinger ask whether this be an unlimited resource loan the negotiation remain ongoing on the detail of the loan term but be focused on ensure that there be limited impact on ukraine balance sheet my hon friend the member for macclesfield tim roca talk about

my inbox the nhs and healthcare service be by long way the single big worry that people talk about after year of conservative mismanagement of both the economy and the nhs have hear from many people about how they be struggle to access nhs service not only for themselves but for their child which cause huge stress for the family and friend of those involve in boris johnson announce that hampshire would have one of new hospital in the sit conservative mp stand against repeat once again that there would be new hospital in hampshire it be frustrating although possibly not surprising to find out after the general election that not only have there never be any money assign to the new hospital in hampshire but that there be billion deficit that we have not previously know about hospital manager along with the chief executive of hospital trust and integrate care board be try to plan the future of healthcare in hampshire which become difficult when the goalpost keep move and when they do not know whether there will be new hospital it be also cause huge stress for the resident around winchester especially those south of winchester who have be tell that they might lose their accident and emergency department and their consultant lead maternity service as part of the new hospital plan have hear from thousand of people include up to who sign petition about the importance of keep our and consultant lead maternity service in and around winchester have hear from many people whose life be save at winchester and who be worried that they might have to travel far there have be public consultation on the location of new hospital and it be currently be review winchester resident be very concerned that none of the suitable potential site in winchester be include as an option people have to choose between north or south of basingstoke this be not only concern for people in winchester who will have to travel far for emergency healthcare it be also concern for the management of southampton hospital who be concerned that the further north new hospital be build the more that people will go to southampton because it be close at the moment southampton hospital be operate at capacity and would need significant new resource if the hospital be build too far north when we look at the future of healthcare in hampshire we should seriously consider why we would build new hospital so close to frimley park which be go to be rebuild because it have reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and be only minute away along the why would we have two new hospital so close to each other would appreciate have meeting with minister to discuss the potential location of any new hospital so that we can ensure everyone in winchester can access healthcare in an appropriate place the location of any new hospital be key to the future of healthcare in hampshire because it will provide healthcare for decade to come however we be aware that the propose new hospital may not be include in the new hospital programme after the review so we need to focus on our current hospital the nhs staff at that hospital be fantastic but we need to look at how we can support it now and in the decade to come apologise for intervene on the hon gentleman without notice appreciate he give way he outline the case for new hospital at junction of the but he be slightly muddle the argument clinical professional recommend location for that hospital with replacement service that be be take from winchester hospital while maintain winchester hospital with certain service blue light time show that there would be no significant difference in access healthcare for someone live in the north half of my old constituency of eastleigh and someone live the part of his constituency that he mention the hon gentleman and his hon friend the new hon member for eastleigh liz jarvis oppose the new hospital so be it not little bit awkward for he to say that the government have no funding plan when he oppose the location and that hospital be create that mean there be muddling of decision making because he and his colleague oppose that hospital be create in the first place we never oppose new hospital that be something the conservatives be say about we we support new hospital we want new hospital and we want modern healthcare service in hampshire however we be very concerned that the propose location of the new hospital be not suitable when we look at how healthcare be deliver throughout hampshire site just north of winchester be identify as suitable when we look at map of hampshire it be clear that those propose location would be much more suitable for people throughout hampshire include those in the hon gentleman constituency to reach emergency service our current department like other department be hugely busy especially as we head into winter we know that many people attend because they can not get the primary care they need up to of people who turn up at be there because they can not get doctor appointment people who be in mental health crisis many be often already on waiting list be go to they take up huge amount of time and staff resource often need to hour of constant monitoring before they can be take to place of safety we also have people turn up with dental issue because they can not access an nhs dentist thank the hon gentleman for secure the debate while there be other hon member in the chamber know the issue well do he agree that the ability to bring healthcare into community be vital particularly for people in isolated community who can not hop on bus every or minute or even every hour to get to their appointment some area simply can not have centralise care or new hospital they do need localise facility if the hon gentleman be ask for that then he be ask for the right thing completely agree with the hon gentleman as vet who have work in public health programme around the world know that it have be prove time and again that it be always more cost effective to treat people in their community and keep they healthy than to treat they in hospital when they get sick we need to focus on that know the government have say that they want to move treatment from hospital into the community suspect the hon member understand that probably will not agree with he on the thrust of his argument about basingstoke hospital however on the point about local community service in my seat in whitehill and bordon there be debate about whether we should keep the old chase community hospital or build new health hub there be argument on both side but the one thing that unite the two be the lack of communication from the hampshire and isle of wight integrate care board do the hon gentleman find it as frustrating as do that that icb seem to not want to communicate with resident across the county agree with the hon gentleman when there be lack of communication with resident decision maker and any other interested stakeholder that be when there be difficulty such as rumour and unnecessary anxiety improved communication whether in healthcare or in any government department solve huge number of problem on the point make by the hon member for strangford jim shannon about access healthcare when people live in rural area have story about margaret who live just south of winchester and who write to say that she have be give an appointment at basingstoke for particular type of ray her journey to basingstoke hospital take well over an hour and involve multiple bus and train plus considerable walking time margaret have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and get exhausted walking long distance and she can not easily afford taxi all the way from basingstoke back to winchester she ask whether people without car be to become second class citizen and be deny access to decent healthcare option we have to look at individual situation and that can include need really good public transport the more community care we have in people town and village the quick they can get there from their home the other side of emergency care and department be social care we have say many time that we can not fix the nhs without fix social care we know that in the hampshire hospital nhs foundation trust there be between and people at any give point who be well enough to be discharge and more appropriately care for in the community with social care package but who be currently stick in hospital bed and can not be discharge that mean that patient can not be move out of and people can not be remove from ambulance as quickly as they could be which mean that ambulance wait time be long when speak to the ceo of winchester hospital he say that the single big help they could get from government would be another social care package although people ask where the money will come from we know it be more expensive to keep someone in hospital bed than to give they social care package we have winter pressure come up indeed winter have already start and the ceo have tell on more than one occasion that to help with those winter pressure more social care package would probably be the single big intervention that would make huge difference local authority struggle to afford social care package and the nhs trust have to fund some of those package out of their nhs budget which be primarily mean for treat people in hospital one of the big concern raise by winchester resident be the potential removal of consultant lead maternity service at winchester hospital that mean that if woman be to haemorrhage or require an emergency section during labour she would need to be transfer to put that into perspective in april of birth be perform via emergency section at winchester hospital it be clear that surgical intervention be not an unusual eventuality but something that will affect more than one in five mother an emergency transfer in such situation would inevitably put the life of some woman and baby at serious risk and tragically some could be lose constituent write to about her daughter who have recently haemorrhage badly after give birth to baby who be in breech position the blood transfusion and lifesave surgery to remove her placenta need to happen within minute and it be unthinkable what would have happen have there be no consultant on hand as someone who have perform many emergency caesarean on animal rather than on human know that time be of the essence and anything that delay surgical intervention can make huge difference not just to whether the person and the baby survive but to whether the baby have potential brain damage and other life change complication as the liberal democrat mental health spokesperson see this debate as chance to highlight how desperately we need more resource put into mental health alongside more holistic approach to treatment when speak to resident in winchester one of the most common concern be the difficulty in access mental healthcare and that be especially true for parent who be struggle to access mental healthcare for their child speak to constituent near swanmore who be struggle to access the mental healthcare and support they need for their child who be anorexic and have an eat disorder they have be inform that their child have to reach low bmi to qualify for the threshold to get treatment because resource be so stretch that would not be consider even remotely acceptable for any other disease person with cancer would never be tell that they need to reach stage before they qualify for treatment we know that outcome with delay treatment for mental and physical health disorder of which eat disorder be combination of both will be much less successful and much less cost effective require long and less successful treatment the long that the condition be leave urge the minister to look with particular concern at the mental health of young people and child delay in mental health treatment for anyone can be catastrophic but three year delay for someone who be only or be huge chunk of their life as part of that we urgently need to invest in primary care fail to address this will only place great pressure on our already overstretch hospital have speak to people who have spend extended amount of time in hospital bed because they can not get the mental healthcare that they need similarly the lack of nhs dentist often force patient to turn up to hospital sometimes need general anaesthetic to sort out tooth root abscess which cost more than provide nhs dental care it seem as though all the dentist speak to say that their current contract for perform nhs care be not fit for purpose urge the minister to look at this as an urgent priority because so many people be not receive the dental care that they need it seem as though this whole issue will not be resolve until the nhs contract be look at the other issue that affect people get healthcare in their community especially around hampshire winchester and the meon valley relate to struggle pharmacy the situation for pharmacy seem to be very similar to that of the dentist in that their arrangement with the government for provide prescription service do not seem to be fit for purpose it seem to be cost pharmacy money to provide prescription drug and they be tell that their business be no long viable the more pharmacy that we lose the further people will have to travel to not only collect drug but get medical advice and vaccine in conclusion wish to pay tribute to nhs staff imagine that they dread the winter come up every year it be stress for they every year they be overwork and every year we know that both clinical and non clinical staff will work long hour than they be contract to do know that they will be brace themselves right now they will be busy and they will be put themselves at risk from get thing such as flu covid and the other respiratory disease that we see in the winter one thing that we can all do both as the public and the government be to encourage everyone to get vaccinate ahead of these winter pressure anything we can do to prevent trip to hospital will make their job easy and make it less likely that they will get sick the hon gentleman speak eloquently on wide range of healthcare challenge in hampshire do he agree that our share integrate care board for hampshire and the isle of wight must do all that it can to make the good of the situation particularly in relation to nhs dentistry and funding for hospice across hampshire and the isle of wight the hon member make good point about hospice in particular only about third of hospice funding be provide by the government it be hugely emotive subject which affect not only the people in the hospice but the whole family who be try to care for love one who often have only week or month leave to go we have two hospice in winchester one of which be child hospice naomi house some of the most moving visit have ever do have be to hospice where the staff and patient be incredibly brave we have debate come up on assist dying we will really have to look at palliative and hospice care and how it be fund and how we make it sustainable and fit for purpose thank he for that important intervention many constituent write to tell about the excellent care that they receive in hospital and how much they appreciate the hard work of nhs staff winchester resident call owen write to tell that he honestly do not believe that he would be alive today be it not for winchester hospital owen sadly suffer from brain tumour in the pituitary gland and have need many emergency treatment owen live five minute from the hospital and have manage to have lifesave treatment there on multiple occasion we need to avoid the trap of cut short term cost such as by not invest in social care which have end up cost the state so much more money in the long run we need comprehensive plan to give people adequate local healthcare throughout their life and escape the endless cycle of crisis after crisis we know that winter be come this year and come next year what be we do to ensure that we will not have an nhs crisis in hampshire next winter as well congratulate the hon member for winchester dr chambers on secure the debate and echo his thank to all health and social care staff who do incredible work in very difficult circumstance we know that our nhs be break whenever mp from across the house come to with issue affect their constituency repeat the same mantra this government will be honest about the issue face our nhs and serious about tackle they lord darzi have already complete his review of the current state of the nhs and his report lay bare the true scale of the challenge face our health service we will not sugarcoat the problem face by the health service in each and every part of the country because colleague from across the house be right to raise issue with and we will fix they together we have already launch our national conversation on the future of the nhs and we want patient family and staff to join that conversation and make their voice hear if member have not already be to the website the address be please let we have some sensible suggestion not fire the secretary of state out of cannon in her spring budget the chancellor of the exchequer announce an extra billion to protect nhs day to day spending every penny of that investment will come alongside vital health reform they be two side of the same coin as the secretary of state outline last week this government intend to publish league table of provider allocate the good talent to the most challenging area and ensure that there be no reward for failure where necessary we will remove fail manager and we will reward senior leader who successfully improve performance on fail organisation just before the general election cross party group of mps include labour mp have meeting with the then secretary of state my right hon friend the member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins about the performance and management of hampshire and isle of wight icb member of parliament from across the political divide have serious concern about its leadership communication and funding not government funding and welcome the increase funding but the way that it be distribute to service in hampshire frankly do not think the leadership be up to run that icb will the minister agree to meet and other member from across the house to discuss the urgency of the situation will he find out from his civil servant where the request for two week action plan go and come back to hampshire mp be sure the official in the box will have note the concern the hon gentleman rightly raise about his icb will ensure that that be communicate back to the minister for secondary care my hon friend the member for bristol south karin smyth so she can look in more detail at those concern and communicate with the hampshire mps if meeting be necessary at the end of that be sure she will be more than willing to meet he and his colleague we want to ensure that every part of our nhs be work as well as it can and as say good performance will be reward as part of our reform alongside college of executive and clinical leadership that will ensure the nhs continue to develop and attract the good talent to top position bring the good outcome for patient and taxpayer alike let turn to some of the specific issue that the hon member for winchester raise on local hospital provision patient deserve to have safe compassionate and personalised care in fit for purpose environment that be why this government have commit to build and refurbishing hospital across the country the new hospital programme include new hospital for north and mid hampshire and major refurbishment at winchester to provide specialist and emergency care as part of the proposal be aware that the local trust explore change to the current obstetrician lead maternity service at the winchester site know the hon member have be strong champion of that have raise it with the prime minister in october as announce in the chancellor autumn budget my right hon friend the secretary of state will set out further detail of the review of the new hospital programme in the come month alongside new and realistic schedule for delivery the hampshire hospital scheme be in scope of the review and acknowledge the local concern over the proposal and the impact on the winchester site and on maternity service my constituent use both winchester hospital and basingstoke hospital as well as other such as frimley park the queen alexandra and guildford understand that clinical assessment be make about urgent treatment and service at winchester but there be need for new hospital in or near basingstoke in what the minister say about review of the new hospital programme accept he say statement be come soon but will he confirm that it be about timing and that he or colleague will come forward to the house soon with the certainty that people in hampshire need absolutely will try to be as unpartisan as can but the hospital programme that we inherit from the right hon member government do not have anything like the money it need to back it up conservative members can shake their head but it be true it have nothing like the money need to bring forward those hospital as have say we will review that our intention be to bring forward those scheme but that have to be do in an achievable programme with the finance to back it up when we announce to the house how we will schedule the hospital programme expect that all the answer he want will be there we intend to introduce the hospital building programme but it must be do with money we can not build they with fresh air any potential new hospital be decade away while the hospital we have need to be maintain and improve the quick way forward be to provide new social care package for winchester hospital will the minister meet and the chief executive officer of winchester hospital to work out how we can deliver those package as quickly as possible and provide good hospital and social care service for everyone in and around winchester it be crucial that we have the good possible health and care service in place for today need while we plan for the future understand the hon gentleman concern and will ensure that they be communicate back to the minister for secondary care so that she can consider they will ask she to report back to he on that ultimately all decision be well make locally so that they can cater to local interest and be clinically lead this be no exception know that the hon gentleman trust will consider all feedback from the public consultation hold early this year include from those who will access the new facility as well as wide body of evidence the result of the public consultation on location and service will be put to the local integrate care board and we look forward to hear the outcome of that apologise for intervene again so soon one of my main concern about the public consultation be that the nhs have assess site in winchester as suitable but they be not then include in the consultation the people of winchester want to know why those suitable site be not include in the consultation can the minister assure that that will be address by the icb and anyone else publish the consultation as say before the hon gentleman intervention ultimately these be local decision and they must be clinically lead if the trust have decide that certain outcome that he would like to see be out of scope of the consultation we must take it as read that there be sound clinical reason for that if he think otherwise be sure that he can bring that up with my hon friend the minister for secondary care but ultimately we must be guide by the clinician they know more than we ministers in whitehall will ever know what the well outcome for their area be the hon gentleman mention primary and community care we know that patient nationally and in hampshire find it increasingly difficult to see gp we be commit as government to fix the front door to the nhs to ensure that patient receive the care that they deserve if patient can not get gp appointment they end up at accident and emergency which be bad for they and more expensive for the taxpayer that be why we will shift the focus of the nhs out of hospital and into community one of our three big shift be from hospital to community the other be from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention those three thing take as whole could be quite transformative in how we deliver primary care agree entirely with the minister on the shift from hospital to community do not want to labour the point that make when intervene on the hon member for winchester dr chambers but in the hampshire part of my seat we have debate about whether we will still have chase community hospital or new health hub there they be both essentially local service the icb be drag its foot and will not make decision on which it will be local people do not know what will happen and decision be be kick down the road by the icb as my hon friend the member for hamble valley paul holmes say the leadership of the hampshire and isle of wight icb be not fit for purpose will the minister meet we and they to ensure that we can get this moving hear loud and clear what conservative member say about the leadership of their icb hope that the icb management will obtain copy of today hansard and read not only those comment but the minister reply expect they to make decision in timely fashion so that there be some certainty for the local population about the new make up of health and care service in that area not just for the sake of patient and the local population but staff as we redesign service and change towards more preventive community focus care some part may become obsolete and it be absolutely crucial that we take the workforce as well as the population on that journey of change in service very much hope that the hon gentleman icb leadership will have hear the message from the minister at the dispatch box which be that they really need to crack on make decision communicate it and work with member of parliament the public and staff on whichever change they propose return to primary and community care as say our manifesto commit to move towards neighbourhood health service with more care deliver in local community so that problem be spot early we will bring back the family doctor by incentivise gps to see the same patient so that ongoing or complex condition be deal with effectively in do so we will improve continuity of care which be associate with well health outcome for patient and our plan will guarantee face to face appointment for all those who want one we will deliver modern booking system that will end the am scramble that be crucial in improve access to general practice the hon member for winchester rightly raise the huge problem with dentistry in his area which be not that uncommon across the whole country do not believe that the previous government dentistry recovery plan go far enough too many people be still struggle to find an nhs appointment we be work to ensure that patient can start to access additional urgent dental appointment as soon as possible and we will target the area that need the most the so call dental desert integrated care board have start to advertise post through the golden hello scheme this recruitment incentive will see up to dentist receive payment of to work in the area that need they most for three year the common reason why child age five to nine be admit to hospital this be absolutely shocking in the year be tooth decay we will work with local authority to introduce supervised toothbrushing for three to five year old in the most deprived community these programme be prove to reduce tooth decay and boost good practice at home to rebuild dentistry in the long term we will reform the dental contract with the sector with shift to focus on prevention and the retention of nhs dentist to be fair this have be an issue for all government go back to the labour government who introduce the dental contract they do so for the right reason but in we recognise that the dental contract be not work in the way we envisage and that it have to change it be shocking that year have pass since then with no real action have be take we be determined to fix that at the same time we will not wait to make improvement to the system to increase access and incentivise the workforce to deliver more nhs care we be continue to meet the british dental association and other representative of the dental sector to discuss how we can well deliver our share ambition of improve access for nhs dental patient have to say that the statistic for hampshire and isle of wight integrate care board make sorry reading only of adult be see by an nhs dentist in the month to june compare with across england and of child be see by an nhs dentist in the month to june compare with across england in there be dentist for every people in the hon gentleman trust whereas the national average across all icb in the same year be just under dentist and in the general practice patient survey success rate for get an nhs dental appointment in the past two year in the hampshire and isle of wight icb area be compare with nationally they be not great statistic nationwide but they be certainly not brilliant in the icb of hon member present and we look for real improvement there turn to the pharmacy sector we want to take pressure off gps by increase the service offer in community pharmacy there be so much more that our pharmacist could and should be do to deliver basic healthcare service on the high street and in the community as part of the shift from hospital to community that would free up thousand of gp appointment in case where people do not really need to see general practitioner for their condition we be committed to look at how we can far expand the role of pharmacy and well use the clinical skill of pharmacist as more become independent prescriber that be where the potential get really exciting now that the budget for government have be set we will resume our consultation with community pharmacy england shortly hope members will understand that be unable to say more until that consultation have conclude suffice it to say that pharmacy first and community pharmacy have huge role to play in improve health outcome in the community in my former role as an assembly member back home we have very close relationship with pharmacy the consultation process that the minister be outline for england would be very much welcome in northern ireland so can ask the minister favour when that consultation conclude will he share his finding with the northern ireland assembly and particularly with the minister in northern ireland what the minister be hop to achieve be what we would also like to achieve the hon gentleman raise an important point no part of the united kingdom hold monopoly on wisdom and if we be do something good or if there be innovation in one part of the united kingdom it be incumbent on health ministers across the devolved administration and here in whitehall to share good practice to work together and where possible take four nation approach hope can reassure the hon gentleman that since this new labour government come into power we have really try to reset our relationship with the devolved administrations and with the various ministers have have several meeting with mike nesbitt on range of health issue that appertain to the whole united kingdom on which we want to ensure there be consistency of approach be more than happy to communicate far with mike nesbitt and colleague in the northern ireland executive on how we reform our health and social care service in england to see whether thing can be take by they in northern ireland vice versa if there be good idea from northern ireland be more than happy to consider they in how we transform nhs service in england the hon member for winchester mention social care and he be right to raise winter resilience have speak about fix the front door to the nhs through primary care reform we also have serious job to do to fix the back door and ensure that patient flow through the system be not hold up because of lack of social care on winter resilience hope he will understand that we be work to ensure that there be no crisis and that we tackle the issue of social care get bed in appropriate place be key part of our plan in the long term there be no quick fix the dilnot reform be announce by the previous government but it be fair to say that when we come into office we find that the money apparently set aside for the dilnot reform have already be spend on other nhs pressure laudable though it may have be to spend that money to try to get waiting time and waiting list down and to fix some of the problem that that government have create it leave we with bit of social care issue give that the reform money have go have disappear and be no long there to be spend over the next decade this government be commit to build consensus on the long term reform need to create national care service base on consistent national standard include engage across the party it be good to see the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar in his place and be sure he will be very willing to work with we as indeed will the liberal democrats we genuinely want to make sure that we get cross party consensus on the future of our adult social care so that we can finally grasp this nettle once and for all and to fix it without it become such contentious issue as it become sadly in and neither of the two main party have good story to tell on this because we have both shamefully use it as political football from time to time it be now appropriate that we set aside those politic and get on with fix social care hope that in due course we will be able to move forward on that agenda assure the hon member for winchester that we be acutely aware of the problem with mental health service we both agree that waiting list be unacceptably high indeed the people of hampshire and most of england be not get the mental health care they deserve he have speak previously about lord darzi report which have shine sear spotlight on the waiting list that young people face in particular be immensely proud that this government be intent on tackle the issue head on with specialist mental health professional in every school in england that be our aim these nhs fund mental health support team in school and college will work with young people and parent to manage mental health difficulty and to develop whole school approach to positive mental health and wellbeing can just check whether hear the minister correctly do he say there would be mental health specialist in every school in england yes that be our manifesto commitment there will be mental health specialist for every school in england in hampshire there be mental health support team assign across the area include school in winchester eastleigh andover and havant in addition we will introduce young future hub in every community and recruit an additional mental health worker across child and adult service we have also set aside million in capital investment for new mental health crisis centre and we be expand nhs talk therapy alongside individual placement and support scheme this government be commit to fix the nhs so that patient include those in hampshire can access excellent care when they need it it be true to say that every labour government have inherit an nhs in far poor state than that which they bequeath to their successor it turn to this labour government to fix our nhs once more question put and agree to house adjourn
