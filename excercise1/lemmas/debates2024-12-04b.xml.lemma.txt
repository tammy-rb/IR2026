rise on our most successful industry put at risk the future of family farm and the rural economy as secretary of state he would rather make performative gesture such as refuse to cross picket line

scotland really do have in his government and in the proven ineptitude of the snp the very bad of all world will be correct if be wrong but think the hon gentleman back former prime minister liz truss

the secretary of state for energy security and net zero be develop guidance on community benefit which will be publish in due course some scot be on zero hour contract with no guarantee of secure hour labour employment rights bill will address that do the secretary of state agree that scot be in insecure work be damn indictment of the state the tories leave our economy in and show that we need new

previous government but an industrial one too we need more high quality job in scotland between our industrial strategy our plan to get scotland work and the employment right legislation we will help to deliver that do not forget that the snp government say that zero hour contract be positive destination for work our plan to make work pay will have big positive benefit in scotland than in the rest of the uk that be the difference in have scottish labour mps on the government benches join the secretary of state for scotland in welcome the shadow secretary of state for scotland to his place congratulate he on his appointment it do make it difficult sometimes to tell the two of they apart that be say especially on day like today today the scottish government will continue to protect the most vulnerable in society from the excess of westminster cut instead of tory cut it will be labour cut to winter fuel payment do the secretary of state agree with the cut to the winter fuel allowance mr speaker be sorry for such short response to the hon gentleman but there be billion reason why that question be rubbish have to say be not surprised there be huge confusion in the labour party about the winter fuel allowance the scottish government be do something about it the uk government be not the secretary of state do not even know the number of pensioner who would be affect by the winter fuel cut labour be now distance itself from labour vote labour to stop labour be that the message his party be send out or should voter just vote for the party that be actually do something about it think what the hon gentleman be tend to forget be that the winter fuel payment in scotland be devolve it be the snp scottish government who decide to mean test it as well if it be not for the billion extra deliver by our labour chancellor at this dispatch box to end austerity which the scottish government will spend today they would not be able to make any decision whatsoever town centre regeneration what step he be take to support the regeneration of scottish town centre commend the hon lady for her work with the chancellor to help to deliver record budget settlement for scotland the large scottish government budget settlement in the history of devolution it be now up to the scottish government to ensure that our town feel the benefit of it there can be no more excuse from the scottish national party the budget also confirm nearly billion of funding for local growth project and we be deliver growth deal in all part of scotland many of which be improve town centre and other community asset hamilton be brilliant place in which to live and work but the board up shop in quarry street tell story of their own what can this government do to support business across hamilton and clyde valley and across scotland which have suffer so badly under the chaos and neglect of two government conservative and snp my hon friend be entirely correct and commend she for stand up for her town in england this labour government have already deliver low business rate for leisure hospitality and retail business which can help high street and be sure that every scottish mp want to see that policy replicate in scotland as we be discuss brilliant town it be timely to mention brilliant retail worker too especially at this time of year be support the christmas campaign organise by the scottish retail consortium and the union of shop distributive and allied workers to encourage everyone to respect our shop worker at this particularly busy time of year for far too long ullapool in my constituency do not have post office which cause great inconvenience to local people recently however tesco step into the breach and we now have highly successful post office in branch in the middle of ullapool may recommend this approach to regenerate town centre to the ministers we be delighted to receive representation of all kind on how to improve our town centre we know that they have suffer neglect for far too long hope that all scottish mps will have be lobby for the kind of support for our leisure hospitality and retail sector that this government have already give south of the border transport connectivity what step he be take to improve transport connectivity between scotland and england may first pay tribute to the hon gentleman my predecessor know that he will continue to represent his constituent assiduously from the back benches both the secretary of state and will be work closely with the department for transport and the scottish government to ensure that cross border connectivity remain top priority for this government extend the borders railway line to hawick and newcastleton and then on to carlisle will boost job help the local economy and improve social mobility the funding for the feasibility study be agree by the last conservative government with the snp administration in edinburgh but the new labour government seem to have push this into the railway siding will the minister ensure that the funding for the feasibility study be release as soon as possible the uk government be fully commit to the borderlands growth deal it will deliver economic growth for the south of scotland and beyond which be one of our key mission the scotland office continue to work with the department for transport the scottish government and borderlands partner on the next stage of business case development for the tweedbank carlisle corridor and on feasibility option for the extension of the borders railway line unfortunately it be ultimately up to transport scotland and the scottish government to follow through on the delivery of this important project call the shadow secretary of state may echo the minister word about her predecessor and indeed my own predecessor as shadow secretary of state and the work that he have do one of the last government decision of which be most proud be the halving of air passenger duty which lead to cheap flight and increase route across the uk however with airline already cut back on route as result of this government decision to hike apd people who do not live within few hour of london on the train such as those in aberdeen face high fare and few option for travel how can the government credibly claim to support well transport connectivity across the united kingdom when those live outside the central belt know that labour member need to be remind that it exist be be punish as the hon gentleman will know we face climate emergency and indeed an economic emergency of his government own making we be face in our first few month in government with billion black hole with treasury reserve spend three time over we have take tough choice to try to deal with the economic inheritance that we receive autumn budget discussion with scottish government what discussion he have have with the scottish government on the autumn budget what discussion he have have with the scottish government on the autumn budget we have reset the relationship with the scottish government and have meet the deputy first minister numerous time to discuss the autumn budget and other issue between the moment when my right hon friend the chancellor stand up and the moment when she sit down scotland be well off to the tune of billion in barnett consequential alone again money that the snp vote against but will spend today encourage the scottish government to use that money to strengthen frontline service bring down nhs waiting time and lift attainment in our school there can be no more excuse we end austerity and it be time that they follow thank my right hon friend for his answer thrive retail hospitality and leisure sector be critical to brand scotland follow the welcome decision in the budget to ensure rate relief for rhl business in england what guarantee if any have my right hon friend have from the scottish government that the extra barnett consequential link to non domestic rate will be pass on in today scottish budget do he agree that any failure to do so would be deeply damaging to the sector thank my hon friend for his question he be absolutely correct the uk budget choose investment over decline include investment directly in my hon friend constituency as part of the million town fund as well as the big budget settlement in the history of devolution he be also right to say that our hospitality business need the rate relief more than ever the scottish government should use their budget to deliver growth and investment to help our high street and pass on the relief should be the bare minimum we have deliver the big budget settlement for the scottish government in the history of devolution with as the house have hear today more than billion of extra funding that can go towards public service do the secretary of state agree that there be no more excuse for the snp and that scot expect and deserve delivery and improvement of our public service of course could not agree more it be not just the billion but all the other investment that the uk government make outside the barnett consequential the labour government have deliver billion of pound more for school and hospital in scotland it be more money than ever before but the snp mps vote against it they vote to deny holyrood its big ever budget settlement by vote against the finance bill last week but of course they will happily spend it in their budget today they also vote against great british energy which will be base in the snp leader own constituency give what we have read about the snp selection process guess the snp mp be keener to send themselves to holyrood than billion of pound of extra funding be sure that pensioner in the secretary of state constituency be as relieve as those in argyll bute and south lochaber that the scottish government budget will introduce pension age winter heating payment for all scottish pensioner the snp government be do the right thing by scottish pensioner will he join in urge the labour government here in westminster to do the right thing by pensioner in england and wales and give they back their winter fuel allowance as well what the hon gentleman have just prove be that the winter fuel payment in scotland be actually devolve one of the consequence of the budget be to remove million of regeneration funding for perth city centre we get practically nothing from the levelling up fund save for that paltry million which the secretary of state be take away just what be it that the uk government have against the city of perth no project have be cancel the perth deal be under consideration by the ministry of housing communities and local government and the treasury it have not be cancel it have merely be pause the hon gentleman should speak to his colleague in the scottish government who have billion extra in barnett consequential to spend today perhaps he could even have chat with some of his colleague sit next to he who seem happy in holyrood than they be here employer national insurance hospices what discussion he have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on the potential impact of propose change to employer national insurance contribution on hospice in scotland know there be consensus right across this house on the enormous value of the hospice sector and the extraordinary work that it do work that sadly have be undervalue for far too long support for additional employer national insurance contribution will be allocate to departments with the barnett formula apply in the usual way for the devolved government the rise do not begin until april and we will set out further detail on the allocation of funding in due course there be hospice in scotland can not be certain of that figure because so many of they be in dire financial circumstance think of roxburghe house in aberdeen which provide service to my constituent and those of other mp in this chamber another organisation that provide vital hospice care be the marie curie charity which provide service in edinburgh and glasgow it also provide hospice at home care the charity be face bill close to million as result of decision make by this government what do the minister have to say about the help that can be provide to marie curie and other organisation as the hon gentleman will know the pressure on hospice funding long predate the budget and relate to the decline in real term fund from the scottish government note that nearly member of the public have write to the scottish government recently to support call from the scottish hospice leadership for fair funding those call might be answer this afternoon when the snp government will have an extra billion to spend this be secure by scottish labour mps but vote against by snp mps it will be spend this afternoon by snp ministers make it make sense prime minister the prime minister be ask engagements if he will list his official engagement for wednesday december order what be those two member play at that be absolutely disgraceful we have start pmq either come in early or at least wait please start read the room it be pleasure to welcome his highness the amir of the state of qatar to the uk look forward to discussion this afternoon on how we be strengthen our relationship and boost trade and investment include an announcement today of billion investment in our new clean energy partnership sunday mark world aids day and we stand with all those we have lose and those live with hiv today we will seek to end new case of hiv in england by also note that we be join in the gallery today by mandy damari the mother of emily british citizen still be hold hostage in gaza have meet mandy number of time and in my view what she be go through be nothing short of torture this morning have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house shall have further such meeting later today would like to concur with the comment the prime minister have just make north devon district hospital be the most remote hospital in mainland england its intensive care unit have only six bed it be almost year old and it serve population of people can the prime minister assure my constituent that their hospital will receive the urgent funding that be need under the new hospital programme so that they will not face more than two hour drive to the near trauma unit the new hospital programme that we inherit be emblematic of the failure of the previous government make promise with no plan to deliver on they we be commit to delivery include the north devon hospital we be review the programme to place it on sustainable footing and the health secretary will set out further detail of the new delivery soon in the meantime we continue to support trust to develop their scheme welcome the swift and decisive action this government be take to secure our border after the conservatives lose control in particular welcome the world first deal strike with iraq last week to tackle smuggling gang do the prime minister agree that international co operation shared intelligence and joint law enforcement be the good way to end the vile smuggling trade thank my hon friend she be superb champion for her constituent and she be absolutely right the previous government leave broken asylum system we have put plan in place the border security command back by million more national crime agency officer and we be introduce counter terror style power my hon friend be right to say that our new international co ordination include the landmark iraq agreement the hard graft be already begin to pay off because people who have no right to be here have be return that be increase on the number of last year the conservatives promise to get the flight off the ground we have get they off the ground call the leader of the opposition pay tribute to mandy damari and her family for the strength they have show we on this side of the house and be sure the whole house continue to seek the speedy release of emily damari and the other hostage the prime minister talk about immigration so it be probably good time to remind he that he be the one write letter ask we not to deport foreign criminal he and his party vote against every single measure we put in place to try to limit immigration the question today be what have be on the lip of all labour mps include believe the health secretary yesterday the prime minister knowingly appoint convict fraudster to be his transport secretary what be he think the previous transport secretary be right to resign when further information come forward what marked contrast to the behaviour of the last year the leader of the opposition talk about immigration there be record level of immigration under the previous government with net migration of nearly million and she be the cheerleader she be the one urge the removal of the cap on work visa she thank the previous home secretary for the work that be do she champion it she advocate it record level of immigration he be obfuscate but be go to keep he on the topic he owe the house an explanation he say that the former transport secretary be ask to resign only after further information come to light what be that further information be not go to disclose private conversation further information come to light and the transport secretary resign what marked contrast while the right hon lady be obsess with westminster issue we be get on with fix the mess and fix the foundation with that billion black hole our prison burst and as we find out last week net migration of nearly million because of the tory open border policy be not ask about migration be ask about the former transport secretary he never answer any question and it look like he do not ask his transport secretary any question either the truth be that he appoint person convict of fraud to the cabinet and the first thing she do be bung hundred of million of pound in pay rise to her trade union friend be this not fraud on the british people no she say she be not talk about immigration and be not surprised advise she not to talk about the economy or immigration for another five year he can try to change the topic as much as he like but the public be watch he owe they an explanation the country need conviction politician not politician with conviction now on to an even big fraud the budget last week the prime minister fail to repeat the chancellor pledge of no more borrowing and no more taxis it be obvious that they be come back for more in his manifesto he commit to make britain the fast grow economy in the do he stand by his own pledge gently remind the right hon lady that two of her predecessor have conviction for break the covid rule also invite she to look at this morning oecd report which have upgrade growth for next year and the year after put we on target to be the fast grow major economy in europe in the next two year she should welcome that have see the oecd report and what it say be that they will be come back for more taxis the whole house will have hear he fail to repeat his own pledge he can not even repeat the pledge he make just few week ago we be here to stop he damage the economy and that be order want to hear the question they be laugh the same way they all laugh during the budget when they talk about raise national insurance they have no idea what people out there be deal with that be why yesterday we vote against his damaging job tax even former supporter such as the chef tom kerridge who endorse labour at the election say that the budget be catastrophic he build real business employ young people unlike this cabinet of trade union stooge cv embellisher and an actual fraudster none of they have ever run business why will the prime minister not listen to business who be say his budget be catastrophic think the scripted joke be over but we have another one and then lecture about the economy from the conservative party that break the economy send mortgage through the roof and leave billion black hole the right hon lady talk about national insurance she complain about the rise in national insurance week after week but then two week ago she say that she would not reverse it she sign trade deal that have farmer protest in whitehall but now she pretend that she be their champion she campaign to remove the cap on migrant worker visa but now she pretend she be furious about the open border policy of the last government the fact be that the prime minister have discard his own labour leadership promise he have drop the five mission he say would define his government he have ditch his pledge to make britain the fast grow economy in the we leave office with the uk as the fast grow economy in the and business be say he have damage the economy with his budget tomorrow he be go to have an emergency reset just five month into his premiership but why should anyone believe word he say the only relaunch on the conservative benches be the leadership bid of the right hon lady rival she obviously have not read the oecd report publish this morning the fast growth in the next two year of any major economy in europe we be proud of that opposition members should never be allow to forget the damage they do to our country they use britain like some sort of mad scientist experiment open border unfunded tax cut neglect health service and now all the madness be still come out but they say they should be back in office they have not listen they have not learn and they certainly have not change there be only one party that be drive this country forward and that be this labour government today it be question but who know next week could be no in the chart as the first mp this year to bring out christmas single will the prime minister join in thank my musical collaborator the hugely talented mal pope and everyone involve with this year everyone deserve hamper campaign which will deliver festive food to home across five constituency in south wales like our song say there reason for the season and everyone deserve christmas thank my hon friend for her christmas single there be obviously go to be some rivalry in the race for no by christmas will not be join that particular race thank she and mal pope for their campaigning remember join she few summer ago in the work involve the hamper which be much need by her constituent know how much it mean to they christmas be time to think of other and pay tribute to she and all those support those in need this government will always support the most vulnerable in our society call the leader of the liberal democrats for one will be download the song by the hon member for neath and swansea east carolyn harris and join the prime minister in his delight about it also join he in support for mandy damari and our joint hope that we will see emily and other hostage release as soon as possible the prime minister have rightly speak about the need to restore and rebuild the public trust in british politic we believe crucial part of that be reform our electoral system to make it fair and more proportional and so do majority of the british public this house vote yesterday in favour of bill for electoral reform put forward by my hon friend the member for richmond park sarah olney will the prime minister make government time available so we can consider that bill about electoral reform and restore the public trust in our politic thank the right hon gentleman for reference emily it be important that we all remember she and the awful torture that her mother be go through as be the case for all the other hostage it be hard to imagine what it must be like for anybody with friend or family who be still be hold hostage after all this time proportional representation be not our policy and we will not be make time for it will just gently say to the right hon gentleman that he do not do too badly under the system as it be be disappoint in that reply and hope that the prime minister will reflect on labour policy move on to another press subject more than million people have be stick on nhs waiting list for more than week that be probably the bad most appalling legacy of the last conservative government and it need to be fix do the prime minister accept that we will only get waiting list down and keep they down if it be easy for everyone to see gp when they need it when he publish his milestone tomorrow will he include guarantee with timetable so that people will be able to see gp within at least seven day or hour if it be urgent the right hon gentleman be right to draw attention to the record of the last government on the nhs record waiting list and record low confidence in the nhs in addition to the economy and immigration they have well not be talk about that for the last five year either we will be drive that down we have already begin that work to make sure that we get those waiting list down and yes of course that include make sure there be well access to gps and other measure that need to be take that be central drive mission of this government give that significant number of member of this place be regardless of class woman of certain age do the prime minister agree that when woman of certain age or indeed any woman of any age and from any background say that they have experience sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour they should be listen to and support and the perpetrator deal with certainly agree with that and think everybody across the house would my hon friend be right because one of the great barrier that woman face when come forward to report unacceptable behaviour in the workplace be have confidence that they will be take seriously that require all of we to put in place mechanism and arrangement to make that possible everybody should be treat with dignity and respect and be proud of the fact that our employment rights bill will strengthen protection from sexual harassment at work friday the be date associate with bad thing happen next friday the european union general product safety regulation will apply in northern ireland create more cost and bureaucracy for english scottish and welsh company that want to do business in northern ireland and northern ireland consumer buy from they many business have already stop supply northern ireland haulage company be unsure of what be require of they online sale platform be divide on the advice they give previous prime minister promise northern ireland business that if they be ask to complete additional paperwork they should phone he and he would direct they to throw that form in the bin what direct tangible advice can the prime minister give to those business that want to continue supply northern ireland that be serious issue and the government be work closely with business to ensure that they be ready for the change that the hon gentleman have identify we publish more guidance yesterday as he know to support they far we will be keep close eye on the issue to help business trade freely across the whole of the united kingdom in stoke on trent and kidsgrove we be proud of our beautiful historic building however many of they lie dormant and blight our proud town will the prime minister outline what step the government be take to bring historic building back into use and will he make time to visit my constituency to see for himself our untapped potential thank my hon friend for raise that issue and will certainly consider his kind invitation we will invest in heritage building restore pride and ensure that they serve the need of local community the national lottery heritage fund have award stoke on trent to help preserve the city heritage historic england be also fund emergency repair at the iconic wedgewood institute and support re form heritage whose office think be base in my hon friend constituency to employ staff dedicate to deliver heritage project today be the scottish budget which contain provision to reinstate the winter fuel payment for all scottish pensioner something that the prime minister famously take away from nearly all uk pensioner support by scottish labour members of parliament but apparently scottish labour be now in favour of the winter fuel payment so what be his advice to labour msp be it to vote for the budget to ensure that scottish pensioner get that single fuel payment or be to stick with his view and vote that budget down my advice to my team be to ensure that the snp be absolutely clear

the scottish pensioner who be leave in the cold by labour cut work very closely with scottish labour in harmonious way we run fantastic campaign early this year which be why the hon lady be sit on the

birthday present ever and meet she to discuss this issue be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise this issue think he will well know and understand that our position be continuation of the position under the last government do the prime minister share my concern at report by audit scotland which have find that the scottish government have no clear plan for the nhs in scotland as scottish labour mp be delighted that this government be provide billion extra for public service in scotland be it not time for snp ministers to get grip and do well for patient in my constituency who face some of the long waiting time for surgery in scotland be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue because waiting list in scotland be appal that be why we make the argument that now that the scottish government have the money and the resource there be no more excuse for poor delivery point of order on point of order mr speaker seek your advice on yesterday debate about job tax on work people who be not work people it depend on the definition of work people the exchequer secretary to the treasury claim that the office for budget responsibility state there be cover up by the previous government in column of hansard we see the word use by the minister he say that the obr use the word cover up not once but twice have since check with the obr it have not say this believe it be creative use of word to suit political narrative could you advise on how could bring the minister to the house to correct the record if no one on the government front bench want to will deal with this first be grateful to the hon member for give notice of the point of order understand that he have notify the exchequer secretary that he intend to refer to this matter in the chamber and thank he for do that the chair be not responsible for what minister say in the chamber that have historically be the case however he certainly have put the record straight in his view and be sure that those on the treasury bench will have note his remark and will reflect on they let put it that way public body ethnicity data inclusion of jewish and sikh categories motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to provide that where public body collect datum about ethnicity for the purpose of deliver public service it must include specific sikh and jewish category as option for person ethnic group and for connected purpose jews and sikhs be in the unique position of be consider both ethnic and religious group under the equality act sikhs and jews have be legally recognise as ethnic group for over year since the mandla dowell lee case in the bill would address fundamental absurdity in the fight against discrimination and inequality which be that we have not collect ethnicity datum on sikhs and jews since law on racial discrimination be first introduce nearly year ago the women and equalities committee be tell in february that the government race disparity audit have identify around dataset across government but find no datum on sikhs the only datum collect on sikhs and jews in more recent year be religious datum however the quality of datum collect by public body on religion as oppose to ethnicity be poor patchy and incomplete religion datum be never use by public body to make decision for the purpose of deliver public service this make both jews and sikhs invisible to policymaker ignore the inequality and discrimination that both group face that be why specific jewish and sikh ethnic category be need and that be what this bill will create this be campaign to end the discrimination that both community face campaign for sikh and jewish ethnicity tick box to be include in the census because we know that for over year public body have be instruct to use the census ethnic group question to design and deliver service in compliance with equality legislation give that we be talk about protect characteristic we would expect public body to be instruct to routinely collect information on sikhs and jews but they be not the then minister with responsibility for equality the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew write this to last year public body and decision maker who think that their decision may affect discrimination harassment or victimisation of sikhs should ensure that their compliance with the duty include consideration of sikh ethnicity however they do not because people incorrectly argue and assume that datum collect on religion be suitable substitute those people do not understand exist practice religion datum be rarely collect to good standard it exclude non practise sikhs and jews and it be not use by public body to monitor and reduce inequality or provide public service the latter be key to this argument because sikhs and jews be miss from whole swathe of public datum on education housing crime health criminal justice the public sector workforce and the ethnicity pay gap the bill would allow public body to start systematically collect datum on sikhs and jews to address the discrimination and inequality that they face which be especially relevant as the government have make commitment to require ethnicity pay gap reporting in present this bill have the support of wide range of community organisation include the sikh council uk gurdwara and organisation the board of deputies of british jews the antisemitism policy trust and the community security trust would like to provide the house with few example of why this bill be so important the pandemic shine harsh light on the inequality between different ethnic group many expert in public health now accept that we be too slow to recognise that some ethnic group be die at far high rate than other the office for national statistics belatedly start analyse covid relate death datum by religious group where datum be available short term exercise that have since be discontinue it find that sikhs die disproportionately from covid even after adjust for region population density area deprivation household composition socioeconomic status and range of other economic indicator not only that but it show that sikhs be affect at very different rate from other predominantly south asian group mean that analysis use the exist ethnic minority category would fail to capture any of these inequality the board of deputies of british jews have also recognise these argument british jews die at almost twice the rate of the rest of the population as there be high prevalence of certain genetic condition among jewish people for example of breast cancer in ashkenazi jewish woman collect well datum will help public service to profile and respond to the community well to address health inequality we need to learn from the pandemic and we need to collect accurate datum to ensure well outcome for both these community base on evidence to give just one example that highlight the absurdity of this system nhs blood and transplant do not collect datum on sikh organ donor or sikhs require an organ transplant despite the fact that for more than decade there have be policy of encourage more sikhs to become donor nhs blood and transplant do not gather the single most important datum point that would allow we to improve sign up rate among this under represent group it be shocking as amanda bowman vice president of the board of deputies of british jews write last year imagine you sit in hospital waiting room and have be ask to fill out form which among other question ask for your ethnicity so which box do tick as david baddiel the author of jews do count have say it be othere and alienate that jews do not have distinct ethnic box to reflect their race since october the british jewish community have face an appalling rise in antisemitic hate attack while the home office collect datum on religiously motivate antisemitic hate crime it do not do so on racially aggravate antisemitism that be despite instance of racial hate crime outnumbering instance of religiously aggravate hate crime by to one there be serious risk that jewish hate crime be be undercounte by the home office because it do not have its own jewish ethnic category in the first half of this year the community security trust find that the majority of antisemitic incident that it record consist of anti jewish discourse link the victim to israel palestine the hamas terror attack or the subsequent war accord to crown prosecution service prosecution guidance hate target someone real or perceive nationality or national origin such as link to israel would indicate racially not religiously aggravate offence the same go for sikhs as be document in the all party group on british sikhs report on anti sikh hate sikh be the most visible minority in britain yet we do not collect datum on racist anti sikh hate the last government hate crime action plan effectively ignore sikh hate or the need to define anti sikh hate herein lie the fundamental problem with focus on datum relate to religion rather than ethnicity when it come to sikhs and jews religion be not mandatory field in crime reporting standard that the home office set for police force apart from in religiously aggravate hate crime case however police force be require to record ethnicity or use ethnic appearance code that relate to census category that do not include sikhs and jews despite their recognition in the equality act his majesty inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service have produce at least report since criticise police force for the poor recording of datum on the ethnicity of victim of crime let give final example in october the chief executive of the uk jewish film festival warn of the erasure of british jewish culture from national cultural life by art body which be of course largely publicly fund benjamin till composer who have be nominate for british academy of film and television arts award tell the jewish chronicle that arts council england do allow jewish people to identify as anything other than religion he insist that arts council england must accept that jewishness be cultural and an ethnic identity as the all party group on british sikhs and the board of deputies of british jews have warn even on its own merit use religious question to capture datum on our community will increasingly become irrelevant the percentage of sikhs and jews who identify with their ethnic group but do not practise their religion be grow as britain become increasingly secular we be fail to recognise the other way in which british sikhs and jews face discrimination ethnicity datum can capture that in way that religion datum do not as the board of deputies of british jews have say we be concerned that until this situation be rectify many jewish citizen will not feel fully count former cabinet member for public health and protection on sandwell council say that sikhs and jews be forget when it come to the design of service because there be no ethnicity datum on jews and sikhs to inform those decision in the rare case where we do have some datum it expose glare inequality in of death of homeless people in london be of sikhs who be of london general population and of sikhs in the uk report that someone in their family have an alcohol addiction good quality datum save life in the past few year the office for national statistics have come to acknowledge the need to ensure that the ethnicity standard reflect the diversity of the uk population that surely mean it be time to address the injustice face sikh and jewish people whatever the future of ethnicity datum collection we must routinely be include in our own right if we consider our legal status as ethnic group we should be include if we consider the size of our population we should be include if we consider our contribution to great britain and society we should be include if we consider the specific form of discrimination and the inequality we face we should be include our community be ask for fairness and justice and to be count as ethnic group give that we have be recognise as such in law for more than year as david baddiel have argue identify antisemitism as religious intolerance rather than racism downgrade its importance which be what lead to jews not count the same go for sikhs and it be not just rhetorical point it be literally the case that regard sikhs and jews as religious category mean we be not count we be not count when we fill in form in an nhs waiting room we be not count in the census and local council do not count we in the datum they use to monitor and deliver service it be high time that change so urge member across the house to allow this bill to progress today it be high time that public body end this injustice and as legislator we must put right this wrong and support they in do that question put and agree to order that preet kaur gill ben coleman jas athwal jon pearce david pinto duschinsky joani reid and alex sobel present the bill preet kaur gill accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday march and to be print bill opposition day allotted dayopposition day farming and inheritance tax inform the house that have select amendment in the name of the prime minister beg to move that this house regret that the government have undo its promise to farmer and be seek to punish they with inheritance tax bill of hundred of thousand or even million of pound by cut agricultural property relief and business property relief far regret that the government have provide conflict information on the number of farm that will be affect and have not conduct an impact assessment of this approach note that figure from the national farmers union suggest that some three quarter of farm will be affect further note that farmer tend to be asset rich but cash poor and that figure from the country land and business association suggest the average arable farm will have to sell of its land to pay the inheritance tax bill that this policy will cause note that the central association of agricultural valuers anticipate that this will affect owner of farming business over generation note also that this land be not guarantee to be use for food production if sell and call on the government not to impose the cut to agricultural property relief and business property relief set out in the budget that will lead to the end of family farming as it have be know for many generation in the uk this government have drive farmer to despair the hike in national insurance the acceleration of delinked payment the fertiliser tax the double cab tax the stalling of capital grant the scrapping of the rural service delivery grant and the slowing down of application to farming scheme be all conspire against our rural economy and the survival of british farm yet the government have add death tax to that the family farm tax which be see family across the united kingdom worry about whether they will be able to hand on their farm to their child as generation before they have do in the day since labour budget the chancellor the secretary of state and ministers have try to justify their family farm tax which will break up family farm by claim that only farm will be affect each year awkwardly the figure use by the chancellor be contradict by figure produce by the department for environment food and rural affairs the left hand do not know what the far left hand be do when the figure be query by the national farmers union the country land and business association the tenant farmers association farmer across the united kingdom and we conservatives ministers tell we all rather patronisingly that we do not understand and that farmer should seek professional advice well farmer have seek professional advice which have reveal just how badly wrong the non economist chancellor have get her number will the shadow minister give way in moment since the budget the central association of agricultural valuers have analyse the family farm tax and apply tax law and the reality of modern day farming to it its analysis have reveal that up to individual owner of farming business could be affect over the come generation even before inflation which be the equivalent of five time the government figure of farm affect in how could they have get this so wrong it be because this city dwell chancellor secretary of state and exchequer secretary do not understand modern farming or the countryside that they have overlook major area of tax policy and forget to consider thousand of farmer as the exchequer secretary have confirm the government forget to include one of the three route to the relief in their calculation they have not include business property relief only claim in their figure which mean that as many as tenant farmer who can not claim agricultural property relief because they do not own the land on which they farm be absent from their calculation what be bad be that minister do not know how many farmer be affect by that the city dwell chancellor and secretary of state have also forget about the farmer who in year go by follow professional advice and transfer their farm into company or partnership those farmer will claim only bpr so they have be leave out of the calculation again minister do not know how many farmer be in that position will the right hon member give way will in minute be tell by adviser that some farmer choose to use bpr only because it be easy in probate guess what yet again minister do not know how many farm be in that position and they have not be include will give way first to the hon member for strangford jim shannon and then to the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume have so much more to say commend the shadow minister for bring forward the debate the collective decision to have this debate in the house be one that my farmer and constituent very much support professional legal advice seek through the ulster farmers union must declare an interest as member of the union indicate that somewhere in the region of of small farmer and family farm in northern ireland will be affect when it come to understand that have labour really get no idea what be go on thank the hon gentleman for intervene the evidence be build again and again against the assurance that the chancellor the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs the exchequer secretary and the farming minister have give the house frankly the farmer outside deserve well and so do we as member of parliament will give way to the hon lady and then carry on with the calculation that the government have get so wrong the right hon member leave trail of destruction across the government she be the health secretary who break the nhs the prisons minister who run out of prison place and the treasury minister who crash the economy no wonder her constituency majority crash from to interruption do she not think it be time to apologise and for once to support the government who be bring back stability to the british economy and farmer profitability order know that member be jeer about reading know that when come to the house it be rule that you should not read but both side be do it remember that rise on point of order mr speaker have point of order from the shadow minister good friend of course this point of order be spontaneous unlike that intervention interruption be mr spontaneity mr speaker you be entirely right that many right hon and hon member read their speech almost verbatim but surely it be just rude and discourteous to the house for the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume to read supposedly spontaneous intervention as if it have just come into her mind she manage to find typewriter and printer in order to write down two page of intervention as expect spontaneity do not make it point of order as the first female prime minister say if they be go after you personally it mean you be win the argument let help the hon member for scarborough and whitby with the second set of calculation that her chancellor have get so wrong because the chancellor cockeye accounting extend to the claim that farmer will be able to transfer million tax free that be wrong only few in specific set of circumstance will be able to claim that magic figure interruption there be jeer from government members but that amount be not available to widow it be not available to people who be single and it be not available to people who own farm with another relative labour magic million figure assume that the surviving spouse live some sort of monastic existence where they have no personal effect to pass on to their love one as farmer from sussex have ask why be widow family be target family write to about their mother who be widow they have calculate that they face an additional tax bill from labour because their father die before the budget and so do not know to transfer his allowance we know that some labour members of parliament have concern the hon member for south west norfolk terry jermy who represent over farm do not know whether he be in his place have ask for assurance on the accuracy of figure use by the government give the demolition of the chancellor figure by the caav and many other will he vote for the family farm in his constituency or will he toe the party line the caav concern about the figure be peddle by the government be share by the institute for fiscal studies cbi economics and even the office for budget responsibility but it be not just about the number labour member need to understand the emotional toll of this terrible tax it be the worry the distress and the sense of betrayal feel by family that should stop ambitious labour mp in their track before they parrot without question the figure give to they by their ministers rise will give way to the hon lady hope that she do not fall into the category that just describe the right hon lady talk about the figure do she accept that her government record be one of leave million of the farming budget unspent in the treasury coffer not help farmer thank the hon lady sincerely for raise that point because she have perhaps unwittingly identify contradiction in defra own claim it talk about million underspend but last week it be cancel the very capital grant that farmer around the country have be invest in say that it have run out of money well it can not be both perhaps that be yet another example of the cockeyed accounting of the chancellor and the environment secretary do my right hon friend agree that what be quite frightening about this policy be that perhaps the government know exactly what they be do and that bit like animal farm they think everything should be collectivise my right hon friend who have wonderful way with word ask question that many member of rural community up and down the united kingdom be ask themselves in fact when the prime minister do regional medium couple of week ago sean dunderdale the wonderful presenter on bbc radio lincolnshire ask he what he have get against the people of lincolnshire might ask what have this labour government get against the countryside rise will give way to my right hon friend and neighbour and then will make some progress as my right hon friend have say the word betrayal be fitting because long before the election pledge be give by both the secretary of state and the prime minister that these change would not be make order the right hon member be very experienced member of this house and he know that he be mean to address the chair not the front bench mr speaker know that you as man of integrity and honour will be as disappointed as be that the government should promise one thing and then do the exact opposite it be great pleasure to have the right hon gentleman not just as friend but as my lincolnshire neighbour he have put his finger on the point genuinely it be the next paragraph in my speech some labour mp must be haunt by the phrasing from the secretary of state during the general election campaign because suspect that they repeat it up and down the market town and village in their constituency when he describe fear that labour would impose this family farm tax as desperate nonsense labour candidate will have repeat that line and assure the farming family in their constituency that labour would never treat rural community in that way yet within week the chancellor be plan to do exactly that since then family across the country have be try to work out how to pick up the piece after labour family farm tax bomb they will not forget farmer from derbyshire email this week to say our hard work and investment as family have be wipe away in the stroke of pen they go on to say my year old husband have bleed on the brain in june and thankfully have make full recovery but ve never see he so stressed he do know what to do hon member represent seat in derbyshire may wish to reflect on how they will respond to that farmer from northumberland have write to as follow we have to talk about which one of my parent be go to die first in front of they he say that labour be destroy people live with this policy many of we be worried about the mental state of many within agriculture and be concerned that it may be the final straw for some in fairness the hon member for hexham joe morris who be in his place have voice concern about whether his government be listen to ordinary people about this will he vote for his farmer or will he toe the party line as farmer wife understand the emotional impact that my right hon friend set out so clearly this be about not only the farmer who will be affect but all the farmer who know that they might be affect this be tax on tragedy and no one know if it will befall they my hon friend and lincolnshire neighbour set out exactly the personal impact of the tax know how treasury ministers look at spreadsheet and those terribly impressive pack of information from civil servant interruption remind government members that this be deeply serious it be not joke also know that chancellor after chancellor have look at the figure and come to the conclusion that this be political decision the current chancellor have get it wrong the shadow secretary of state make an important point about the health and wellbeing of our farmer as operation waiting time be almost three time high when she be health secretary than they be in do she not welcome the investment that this government be put into our nhs interruption do not worry will deal with that thank the hon gentleman for raise the important issue of mental health in farm across the national health service be proud to work as member of parliament and as secretary of state for health to massively increase investment in mental health service if he be rural mp be sure that he will know how isolated farmer can be and the pressure on their emotion at the good of time they have the weather disease and crop cycle to contend with this pressure merely add to that as we have already hear from farmer who have contact also gently remind the hon gentleman that the family farm tax or tax on tragedy as my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson call it so bleakly will raise million in accord to the king fund that be equivalent to about day worth of service in the nhs in england it will not be quite the game changer that some in the hon gentleman party believe it to be what about the family in the south west whose beloved father die decade ago in tragic circumstance leave three young child who be now in their teen the mother have run the farm and bring up their child in the midst of their grief she have now be diagnose with life threaten illness at the age of two of the child want to carry on the farm when they reach but should the unthinkable happen and they lose their mum they will be saddle with labour family farm tax of what empathetic and meaningful response do the secretary of state who be not in his place where be the treasury minister have for that family they will be watch and listen we take the unusual step of give lot of notice to labour mp that we would debate labour family farm tax today we do that because we want to give labour mps in rural seat time to reflect and consider whether they can continue to support this vindictive tax for example welsh landowner tell that he will have to sell six tenant farm to pay labour family farm tax that be six farming family who we on the opposition benches would describe as work people who will lose their business their family home and their child farming future those six farming family have be forget by this government the hon member for montgomeryshire and glyndŵr steve witherden have call on the treasury to produce its modelling on the impact on family farm will the treasury do that at the back bencher request how will he vote today the hon member for south east cornwall anna gelderd meet farmer early this month and claim that she would take their concern back to westminster will she raise those today and vote against this tax have consult widely with farming community and farmer in my constituency have not be able to identify single farmer who feel that there be anything good in this policy whatsoever do my right hon friend know whether there be single labour member of parliament represent rural community who genuinely believe that they will be vote in their constituent interest tonight sincerely thank my right hon friend for set out clearly the choice ahead of member across the house we on the opposition benches know who we be stand up for we back our farmer we understand how difficult farming be as way of life it will be for individual member of parliament to decide how they vote the right hon lady talk about choice and back farmer the current leader of the opposition do trade deal with australia and new zealand that sell farmer down the river be that her version of back british farmer be pretty sure that the hon gentleman have his fact wrong about the then trade secretary the conservative party be in favour of trade deal but we want trade deal that well support our farming industry interruption before labour member start shout at he will know that the fear and concern about those trade deal have not come to fruition what be more we as conservative be proud of the fact that we would not enter trade deal that require the flooding to these shore of chlorinate chicken or hormone treat beef also gently remind the hon gentleman that as back bencher talk about foreign territory give the context of the debate about the chagos island be bit brave we do not have much trade with the chagos island my right hon friend be right to highlight the devastating effect of this policy and to highlight the incredible rounding up exercise on the treasury account book of the contribution that it will make to nhs expenditure with the labour party have serious foothold in rural constituency for the first time since do she not find this rather inept politic which be perhaps not surprising from such london centric front bench the policy show wilful ignorance of rural life and deliberate attempt not to understand the pressure and be in essence sell those rural labour mp down the river thank my hon friend for that point there be some interesting polling come out today which will deal with of course mr speaker very much accept your point about trade but we be genuinely concerned about the national security implication of the chagos island deal can assure the right hon lady that so be very much so mr speaker will give way to the hon member for hexham joe morris be he go to speak up for his farmer commend the right hon lady commitment to honesty she talk about give labour members advance sight of the opposition day motion but when do the labour whips office receive the title of the opposition day debate may invite she to correct the record perhaps be so sorry in fairness the hon gentleman be obviously speak to farmer in his constituency on sunday do hear that there be protest go on in his constituency at the moment in any event actually make the announcement on national television on sunday perhaps he be not watch farmer at home will be wonder what on earth we be argue over one word that the right hon lady have not mention be brexit the great tory disaster of the last parliament how much do she estimate that brexit cost farmer and the rural community the hon gentleman and unusually can join force on this matter while be go to resist the temptation to revisit brexit what will do be point he to paragraph of the caav report order you be face totally the wrong way can not pick up anything please turn around my apology mr speaker be remind of paragraph of the caav report which set out the peculiar legal problem pose by the family farm tax in the context of scottish farming tenant it be incredibly complicated but that be real concern and trust that the snp will be explore it alongside conservative members of parliament in conclusion before ambitious back benchers or indeed the exchequer secretary get to their foot and accuse these farmer and we of scaremongere something they have be happy to do in the past they should think on discover some humility and compassion and ask why ten of thousand of decent hard work and sensible people across the united kingdom know that the chancellor have get it so wrong polling by the country land and business association today show what the public think they do not think farmer should be whack with the family farm tax they think that labour have break its promise to end countryside decline they think the government should be cut taxis on rural business and be not confident that the labour government can deliver growth to rural community say to every hon member on the government benches do the right thing and stand up for our farmer who be the good in the world and whose produce be renowne globally they feed we and now they need we labour mps need to join we and axe the family farm tax beg to move an amendment to leave out from house to the end of the question and add thank farmer for their immense contribution to the uk economy and the nation food security welcome the government commitment of billion to the farming budget over the next two year the big budget for sustainable food production and nature recovery in uk history acknowledge that the government be have to make difficult decision to protect farm and farmer in the context of the billion fiscal blackhole leave by the previous government recognise that the government be seek to target agricultural property relief and business property relief to make they fair whilst also fix the public service that everyone rely on and note that under the change announce in the budget around three quarter of claim for agricultural property relief include those that also claim business property relief be expect to not pay more inheritance tax welcome the chance to open the debate on behalf of the government the government commitment to farmer be steadfast as our amendment make clear farmer make an immense contribution to the uk economy and to the nation food security we recognise and respect the crucial contribution that farmer make to our country way of life we must also recognise however the state of our public service and the mess in which we find the public finance when we come into power there be no way we could have leave thing as they be unlike the conservatives there be never any question of labour ignore the billion black hole that we uncover in the public finance we have to bring the previous administration fiscal irresponsibility to an end we have to ensure that our country live within its mean we have to get public service back on their foot while meet our tough new fiscal rule which end borrow for day to day spending that be what we as responsible government have to do that be why at the autumn budget the chancellor set out number of difficult but necessary decision on tax welfare and spending these decision be to restore economic stability fix the public finance and rebuild our public service one of the decision we take be to reform agricultural and business property relief we choose to do so in way that maintain significant tax relief for family farm while fix the public finance as fairly as possible the hon gentleman will want to explain this mr speaker the government have argue that only of farm will be affect by this measure while the national farmers union say it be will he at least give we an indication from the dispatch box perhaps support by note in the library of the house show the modelling that contradict the nfu figure point the right hon gentleman to the letter the chancellor recently send to the treasury committee which set out some of these figure in detail some of the confusion that he and other hon member have encounter might come from the fact that there be different set of datum the set of datum he may be refer to relate to the total value of farm across the country but if we be think about inheritance tax claim it be right to look at his majesty revenue and customs claim datum on inheritance tax look simply at the value of farm do not tell we what the inheritance tax liability for that farm may be give that we would have to look at the ownership structure at who own what and at any liability and so on that might be where some of the right hon gentleman confusion be come from at treasury question yesterday raise with the hon gentleman the case of upper peppershill farm in long crendon small acre arable farm in my constituency which the shadow secretary of state and the leader of the opposition visit few week ago the family have calculate that if they borrow the money to pay this new tax it will take they year to pay it back what do the minister say to the seed family in long crendon about the tax bill they face it be not appropriate for as minister to give specific tax advice to one family but will talk about the general principle behind our reform in fact be about to begin set out some of the detail of our policy on the general principle be the minister seriously say that all the tax adviser advise all the farmer across the country and all the land valuer who be qualified in way that he be not be wrong and that he be right what be explain be that the datum for claim through hmrc which show the claim make under agricultural property relief and business property relief be the correct set of datum to work out future liability on that basis that be what the projection that we have put out be base on that be set out in the chancellor letter to the treasury committee that mention urge the right hon gentleman and his colleague to review that letter to understand the datum be talk about in more detail rise would like to make bit of progress to explain some of the detail behind our policy which may answer some of the question that hon member be jump to their foot to ask we know that inheritance tax be always an emotive issue and understandably so it be natural desire for people to want to pass on their asset to the people they love when they pass away the standard single rate of inheritance tax have be since and asset have generally long be entitle to nil rate band relief and exemption form of relief for agricultural property be introduce on estate duty in the finance act mean that this duty be charge at of the rate that would normally have apply new agricultural property relief and business property relief be create in the with the introduction of the capital transfer tax the rate of relief increase over time to maximum of relief that maximum rate be then increase to in this mean that agricultural landowner and farmer do not receive relief for almost all of the century and yet farm pass down between the generation be grateful to the minister for give way that be why the law be change to introduce relief family farm be not be pass down because the value of land be increase will he consider that before bring in these change to address the right hon gentleman point we recognise that agricultural and business property relief play an important role in support family farm but the full unlimited exemption from inheritance tax have simply become unsustainable the four most recent year worth of datum make clear why the data show that very small number of agricultural property relief claimant include those who claim business property relief too benefit from very significant amount of relief in total of the exchequer cost of the relief go to the top of claim to be clear what that mean will put it another way for every or so estate the top one among they claim half the total relief let tell the minister what concern most there have not be an impact assessment but if the major driver for the government whether we accept it or not be to raise some money from this source why be other more effective mechanism not use such as business roll over relief where business could be sell in another context and roll over into buy the land defer capital gain tax if that mechanism have be use the money would have be take from much wealthy people who be not actually produce food in the first place now we be capture massive proportion of small family farm completely unnecessarily because due consideration of well alternative be not do by the minister reassure the right hon gentleman for whom have lot of respect personally that we carefully consider how to calibrate the policy to ensure that significant relief from inheritance tax be still available to family farm while at the same time fix the public finance in as fair way as possible be very grateful to the minister for give way he have just refer to his analysis of four year of datum which lead he and the government to this position that be an incredible thing to ask the house to believe because just few month ago his right hon friend the now prime minister and secretary of state be specifically rule out these policy to audience of farmer and landowner if the datum of four year standing tell he that this be the right policy why be those now minister economical with the actualité when they speak to the farmer themselves the datum we do not have before the general election be the billion black hole that the hon gentleman party leave in the public finance he know that because it be acknowledge by the office for budget responsibility that the full information be not share with it it have say that its forecast would have be materially different have it know that that be the case we have have to take number of difficult decision this talk of datum remind that over farmer and agribusiness have go out of business since will the minister reassure about what we be do to improve profitability in british farming my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the decimation of business during the conservatives time in office business across the economy need stability public finance on firm footing and investment in our public service that be what business across the country need to invest for the future and grow be very grateful to the hon gentleman for give way he be treasury minister may suggest that some of the disparity between the treasury figure and those of other reputable body represent agricultural interest be because of land value average value for ordinary land in the cotswolds be now an acre will he accede to the request of my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen former chief secretary to the treasury and publish an up to date impact assessment on how many farm this tax will affect lot of datum have already be publish mention the chancellor letter to the treasury committee and further detail on the impact will be publish alongside the draft legislation in the normal way suggest that the hon gentleman read the letter to the select committee as he and the his right hon friend will know the impact be typically publish at the time of draft legislation that be the normal process indeed it be the norm under the previous government rise will take one more intervention and then will make progress some of the correspondence have receive on this issue talk about the fact that the measure inflate land value do my hon friend agree with that assessment and what will the change do to help farmer across the country in that respect my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the fact that some of the feature of the current inheritance tax relief system mean that it be an attractive vehicle for tax planning to reduce inheritance tax liability people who have wealth who have never be farmer and do not intend to become farmer have be use it as way to avoid inheritance tax in fact reduce that should take some of the pressure out of agricultural land value and would hope help to make more sustainable farming sector in the future it be important to get the fact right and to get the right number of farm in frame the minister must know that the caav have say that the government estimate be down by factor of five accord to its impartial independent review farm will be in frame for this tax not the figure the minister be rely on my response to the right hon gentleman be the same as that to the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes believe he be look at the datum for the total value of farm rather than for inheritance tax claim the two be different thing for instance farm worth million own in equal share by five individual would have no inheritance tax liability because of the way claim work that be where think some of the confusion have come from there be different datum around the value of farm and around the value of inheritance tax claim for the purpose of today debate it be the inheritance tax claim that be the right datum to focus on on the point about fact be fascinate by the end of the shadow secretary of state contribution she opine on whether labour be stick to its promise to end the decline in the countryside wonder who be in government for the last year while the countryside be decline the conservative government sell out british farmer through trade deal and farming business go out of business do my hon friend agree very much agree with my hon friend he point out repeat pattern of the opposition their total refusal to take any responsibility for the damage they cause over the past year they may wish it never happen the british people disagree rise be go to make some progress just set out some statistic that show how this tax relief be very concentrated in small number of claim in the context of the dire fiscal situation we inherit and the critical need to fix the public finance and get public service back on their foot it can not be right to maintain such significant level of relief for very small number of claimant that be why from april the full relief from inheritance tax will be restrict to the first million of combine agricultural and business property above that amount there will be an unlimited relief so inheritance tax will be pay at reduce effective rate of up to rather than the standard the new system it should be note remain more generous than in the past as mention the rate of relief prior to be maximum of on all agricultural and business asset include the first million the relief we be provide will be on top of all the other exemption and nil rate band that people can access for inheritance tax take in combination this mean that couple with farmland will typically be able to pass on up to million worth of asset to their descendant without pay any inheritance tax thank the minister for give way the caav call the million figure unrealistic and unreasonable do he not agree the million figure be what typical couple could expect to pass on to their direct descendant use the various nil rate band and inheritance tax relief would advise any specific family to get advice from an accountant or financial adviser in term of the scale of relief when we combine the inheritance tax relief to agricultural and business property relief along with the nil rate band nil rate residence band and the transferability between spouse that be how we come to the figure of million give that he appear to be lead for the government on this issue rather than the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs can the minister tell how many farmer he have meet personally over the last three month he seem very confident about how this will affect they the exact number please of the farmer you have meet personally over that period order the hon lady should ask how many farmer the minister have meet rather than how many have meet have meet member of the national farmers union represent the farming industry number of time since the budget for detailed discussion that have help we to understand the impact that this policy will have and to ask for their support in communicate how it will work rise be go to make some progress be go to continue to explain how some of the other exemption within the inheritance tax system will benefit people affect by this policy can the minister confirm that in the case of farm worth several million pound any mortgageable value be not include for the purpose of inheritance tax might that explain the discrepancy in some of the figure that be be bandy around in which believe mortgage have not be take into account that be an important point look at the pure asset value of farm do not tell we what their inheritance tax liability might be as my hon friend rightly point out any liability must be net off against the value of any estate and the ownership structure the various nil rate band previous spousal transfer gifting and so on need to be consider will the minister give way no be go to make some progress as my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire louise jones have point out range of exemption need to be take into account full exemption for transfer between spouse and civil partner will continue to apply any transfer to individual more than seven year before death as gift will continue to fall fully outside the scope of inheritance tax and taper relief will apply in certain circumstance within that time furthermore any tax that be due in relation to these asset can be pay in instalment over year interest free those payment term be more generous than in any other part of the tax system as have mention several time during the debate these decision have be base on understanding that draw on datum from both defra and hmrc note that there have be some confusion on the opposition benches whether wilful or not about what the data show the hon gentleman have make an important point but analysis will show that over year period of the profit from the average acre arable farm own by couple will go back towards pay inheritance tax that do not leave enough money for they either to invest or to live wonder how the hon gentleman think they can deal with that have confidence in the way in which we have calibrate the policy as say to the right hon member for salisbury john glen it have balance the need to retain significant generous provision of inheritance tax relief for family farm with ensure that at the same time we fix the public finance in the fairest way possible the hon gentleman be be very generous with his time in view of the point that have just be make by my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson will he not consider at the very least look at some dispensation for farmer above certain age give the lack of time that they will have to plan for this intervention the truth be that someone who be near retirement age will be face with the prospect of year of all their project profit be eat up by this tax which will mean that the farm can not go to the next generation the hon gentleman must surely look at some mitigation to deal with that reality for so many farmer who be concentrate in that old age group we know that individual circumstance will vary any individual who be concerned about their specific tax liability should obviously consult an accountant or financial adviser we would not know from thumbnail sketch whether that person have any inherit nil rate band what their liability be what decision they have make about gift and so on huge number of factor will play into this and it be right for individual to seek specific advice thing that be say in this chamber may be create undue anxiety when people should be look into the detail the minister seem to be try to suggest that not much farmland will have to be sell off as result of this policy however on november follow an urgent question when ask his colleague the minister for food security and rural affairs the hon member for cambridge daniel zeichner how food security would be preserve if farm have to be break up and sell off possibly for development he reply of course there be trade off there be range of pressure on our land in respect of housing food energy and so many other thing that seem to constitute an acceptance that we will lose farming land and people will be build on it instead that be not how interpret the comment but make no apology for the fact that we want to support farmer as well as make our energy transition and building home for people across the country we need to ensure that we be achieve all the goal that the people of this country elect we to achieve want to say more about datum because several member have raise the subject as have explain few time now the defra datum show the asset value of farm in england but it be not possible to accurately infer future inheritance tax liability from datum on farm asset value any inheritance tax liability that farming asset may face will be affect by who the owner be the nature of the ownership how many owner there be any borrowing that they have and how they plan their affair the minister talk about datum give the massive discrepancy involve and the impact of this policy if the datum show in month and month that the government have get this catastrophically wrong will they revisit the policy and do turn when we approach policy in government we test they thoroughly and consider the detail and the datum and we ensure that any conclusion we draw be base on the correct set of datum which be part of the conversation that we be have today do not know whether it be due to mischief or misunderstanding but there be certain focus on the total value of farm rather than on inheritance tax liability the datum on inheritance tax liability be the correct datum to look at when evaluate the impact that the policy may have will the minister give way be go to make some progress as say early farm worth million but own by five relative in equal share could have no inheritance tax liability will the minister give way will give way to the liz truss cheerleader on the back benches the cla have point out that of farm be own by individual the datum produce in the letter do not take that into account it concentrate on couple who will receive the relief note that the hon gentleman grasp of economic be about as good as liz truss be as have say the importance of the claim datum be that it tell we what the inheritance tax liability will be understand that member be refer to many other source and set of datum but when we be look at the impact of change in inheritance tax relief it be claim datum that tell we what that be likely to be will the minister give way be go to make some progress have give way many time already look at the hmrc datum which relate to estate make claim for agricultural and business property relief be the correct way to understand inheritance tax liability that datum show that our reform be expect to result in up to estate claim agricultural property relief include those that also claim business property relief pay some more inheritance tax in let put that in context it mean that nearly three quarter of estate claim agricultural property relief include those that also claim business property relief will not pay any more tax as result of these measure as this change be introduce we expect people to respond in number of way to reduce their inheritance tax liability and the costing by the office for budget responsibility assume that that will be the case people may change ownership structure plan for their succession differently and make great use of gift provision and insurance thank the minister for give way he be be generous he have mention claim for agricultural property relief and business property relief but what about claim for business property relief alone have they be include in his figure thank the hon lady for her intervention as we know any farmer who be rent out land or farm it themselves will typically have an estate that include an element that be eligible for agricultural property relief the figure set out include those who claim for business property relief as well and those figure be set out in the chancellor letter to the treasury committee despite attempt by the opposition to hijack this debate can honestly if they want to champion our agricultural community they might have start around year ago the conversation that have have with farmer in my constituency have be balance and productive in their scope with an understanding of why the provision have be bring in give that two third of the land buy in england in be buy by non farmer do the minister agree that it be right that this government be take the opportunity to close what be essentially tax loophole for non farmer thank my hon friend very much for her intervention it be tell that when she make such an important and sensible point the opposition do not want to hear it and try to shout she down as she rightly point out our change to the relief will make buy land less attractive as means of inheritance tax planning this mean that land price be likely to become more affordable for farmer thank to reduction in tax motivate investment in agricultural land will the minister give way have give way already so be go to make some progress the reform should be see in the context of the significant exist support for the farming industry in the wide tax system include the exemption from business rate for agricultural land and building the ongoing entitlement for vehicle and machinery use in agriculture to use rebated diesel and biofuel and the exemption from the plastic packaging tax for the plastic film use to produce silage bale on top of that farmer be able to add together their profit from farm over two to five year and be taxable on the average of those profit build flexibility into their tax arrangement for difficult year and unexpected challenge do the minister agree that in the government haste to target tax avoider such as jeremy clarkson and other as have be mention they have actually catch lot of small and medium sized farmer in their sight in completely irresponsible way although our policy should discourage the kind of tax planning to which think the hon gentleman refer the policy be broad than that it be necessary to balance significant relief from inheritance tax on family farm with the need to fix the public finance and that be the balanced decision that we have take with this policy of course the decision on this tax policy sit alongside the government wide decision at budget there be billion over two year for farming and land management in england which will help restore stability and confidence in the sector that include the large ever budget direct at sustainable food production and nature recovery in our country history despite the difficult fiscal inheritance million of funding have also be prioritise for the farm recovery fund to support farmer impact by severe wet weather over the last year the minister rightly mention the need for more sustainable land management but be it not the case that the change to apr will actually undermine the sustainable land management initiative that farmer in mid sussex be try to deliver every day no that be not the case the minister for food security and rural affairs my hon friend the member for cambridge daniel zeichner who will be respond at the end of this debate can set out more about what the government be do to support farmer in their work on land management across the country back british farming ahead of the general election and back the farmer in my constituency be proud to sit on these benches with labour government who be back british farmer with an investment of billion in the recent budget do my hon friend agree that it be absolutely essential that we make sure that the money get into the pocket of our farmer my farmer complain about the delay that they experience when the conservative party be in power my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to the mismanagement under the previous government and to how important it be that through the commitment we make in the budget on the farming budget over the next two year we support farmer across the country as evidence of our steadfast support recognise that the reform we be make to agricultural and business property relief will have an impact on some individual recognise that some of the large estate particularly those worth over million may be affect by the change but the reform to the relief will maintain significant level of relief from inheritance tax at total exchequer cost of over billion in the year that the reform take effect before rise far they offer support for family farm and business across the country we could not justify leave the situation unchanged with full unlimited tax relief benefit very small number of estate by very significant amount do my hon friend agree that perhaps unsurprisingly give the name of their political party conservative member seek to preserve the status quo which include the top of claimant the wealthy accounting for of the overall apr budget do he agree that the conservatives need to set out how they would make the situation fair and provide well deal for our agricultural sector my hon friend be absolutely right to point out that the conservative party have no idea about how the country need to change no idea about how to get the public finance back in order and no idea about how to get public service back on their foot or how to deliver economic stability farmer in my constituency tell how much they be struggle to see gp and to get public transport the bus just be not there the rural economy have be ruin by year of conservative government can the minister reassure we that the necessary action that we be take in the budget will get our public service work again for our farming and rural community order intervention should relate to the debate in hand will not try your patience madam deputy speaker but feel that my hon friend intervention relate to the debate in hand as we have have to take tough decision on taxation policy in order to fund our public service those public service be of course enjoy by people across the country include farmer and those in rural community will the minister give way on that point will make some progress as be say we could not justify leave the situation unchanged with full unlimited tax relief benefit very small number of estate by very significant amount give that there be such an urgent need to repair the public finance and to improve the hospital school and road on which people across the country depend include those in rural community there be lot of talk from the opposition who be get very excited by this debate about farm but we have to remember that farm rely on farm worker in the name of accuracy could my hon friend put on the record reminder of which opposition party include the lib dems vote for the abolition of the agricultural wages board under the last government that actually drive down rural wage and we should be talk about farm worker be it not true to say that when the opposition refer to exemption the only thing they want to talk about be exemption from their own record be under scrutiny my hon friend make powerful point about the record of the opposition party in our budget we make sure to protect the payslip of work people by not increase income tax employee national insurance or vat our approach to reform strike the right balance between provide significant tax relief for family farm and fix the public finance in fair way as such commend the government amendment to the motion before we today call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be my utter privilege to speak on behalf of my party and farmer in westmorland and lonsdale represent people all the way from the yorkshire dale and the north pennines to the lake district and the cartmel peninsula we be proud of our farmer not just because they feed we and care for our environment but because they be the steward of our heritage when unesco award the lake district world heritage site status it give as much credit to the farmer as it do to the glacier that form the landscape in which we live which drive tourism economy with more than million visitor year we seriously value our farmer and they need to hear that because the tone of the debate not just today but over the last few month have suggest that politician do not value farmer however word be cheap have no doubt about the hon gentleman personal commitment but do not the liberal democrats have credibility problem for all the rhetoric in this chamber and outside when they actually get their hand on power in local government such as in oxfordshire they brutally attack their farmer by ban all meat and dairy that be nonsense wherever liberal democrats be in control we back and support our farmer and be proud to do so talk be cheap and most people in this house will at some time quite rightly have utter the sentiment that british farmer be the good in the world without actually understand why it be true that they really be the good in the world and that be because the way in which our farming economy be structure be base on the family farm family farming make difference because it have close husbandry high environmental standard high welfare standard and well quality produce it be not an accident that british farming be the good in the world do the hon gentleman think that the difficulty with the labour party be that it just do not understand farmer because they do not fit neatly into its clumsy definition of what work person be these be people who work hour day outside in the tough environment and who work into their old age but they do not get into the labour club there be something in that and will come to that in moment when talk about poverty in our countryside when it just do not look the way people in urban community think it ought to look there be no doubt that family farm be under attack but this do not start on july and want to go through why we have end up where we be now the botched transition from the old farm payment scheme to the new one be the principal source of hardship among our farmer let we start with the fact that the environmental land management scheme elms budget see million underspend under the last government and that be not an accident it be blindingly obvious that that be go to happen one hill farmer speak to just last month tell that as consequence of the transition he will lose year in basic payment to replace it he will gain under the sustainable farming incentive by the way it cost he to go through land agent in order to get in in the first place the hon gentleman be make profoundly important point not for the first time he be speak as liberal democrat but also in way that belie the fact that he be liberal democrat because he be genuinely committed to the countryside he have make point about family farm the important thing about they be not only the argument that he have already advance but the sense that they represent continuum an investment for the future the reason this policy be so detrimental be because it impact on that sense that farmer be invest now for generation to come be go to get to that but the right hon gentleman will have to tolerate accurately pin blame on his side before do so we be tell by the last government that they would maintain the amount of funding that we use to spend when we be in the european union in england that be billion in one sense and one sense only they kind of keep that promise because it be billion throughout that five year however they do not spend it because they phase out the old scheme very rapidly cause great hardship particularly to small family farm and they bring in the new scheme far too slowly and make it very difficult for people to get into they by the way the people who be able to get into the new scheme be the big farmer they be the landowner who have land agent to help they get into the scheme so the large landowner with the big estate manage to get into those scheme they be all right broadly speak it be the small family farm the farmer who own their own farm and the tenant who have struggle it be also worth bear in mind that there have be little bit of inflation since the cost of run farm have go through the roof when it come to feed energy fuel and all sort of input cost so the fact that we be at just billion now as we be five and bit year ago be absolute nonsense it be important also to recognise that the grant that be available under the last government and now be in reality often only available to those who have the cash flow to be able to get they in the first place if land price be to go down as have be describe by the minister be not sure believe that and farmer have borrow heavily from the bank the bank might look at the value of their asset and could possibly call in the loan which would put the farmer out of business right away have hear that from land agent in my own constituency and my hon friend make really interesting point we obviously do not know what will happen unless and until it happen but that could be exactly what happen in which case there would be no money to invest in business and people would end up not be able to pay back their loan also the government would not make anything like the amount of money that they think they be go to so whatever the outcome it be bad news for farmer and also for the exchequer it be also worth bear in mind where the money that the last government spend have go it have go on landscape recovery and other scheme mostly take up by very very large estate where either small farmer get nothing or tenant farmer have to do exactly be they be tell in my part of the world we have see something akin to lakeland clearance over the last three or four year as result of all this so let we not forget that before july the farming economy be under enormous threat and in enormous danger either by accident or design due to the failure of the previous government and the conservatives need to take that on the chin the hon gentleman mention tenant farmer and know that he will have some in his constituency as do in mine in shipley nationwide third of all farmland be manage by tenant farmer last month the department announce the appointment of new commissioner for the tenant farming sector in england which hope that the hon gentleman will welcome do he agree that the last government be operate much more in the interest of large landowner than of tenant farmer the hon lady make good reference to the outcome of the rock review which take place under the last government although they take too long to put those thing into practice be pleased that this government have say that they will implement the recommendation of the rock review baroness rock deserve enormous thank and praise from all of we for her work defend tenant farmer and the fact that she have not be replace be very regrettable we be talk today about farming and the consequence of the inheritance tax issue it would have make so much more sense give the impact on tenant if the commissioner and their framework have be put in place before this policy be bring into practice this feel like put it the wrong way around rise be go to crack on now and not take any more intervention because with help from member on either side have already take up nine minute of this place time want to give the house final run through of some of the consequence of the terrible failure of the conservative government on farming in the last five year alone livestock farm income have drop by year on year there have be drop in sheep number of over and annual drop in the number of dairy farm we lose dairy farm last year alone so that be where we be and that be before we get into trade deal or the attack on rural service healthcare and dentistry be also go to quickly make reference to brexit because without doubt our leave the european union and the terrible deal that the conservative government sign we up to have have the big impact of all on agriculture madam deputy speaker you would think that the new labour government have massive open goal in front of they give what they inherit from the conservatives they have massive open goal with no goalkeeper between the post but somehow the ball end up in row find it almost impossible to countenance how they have manage to fluff that opportunity want to talk about two people in my constituency who give really useful insight into the family farm tax in the last couple of day both of they give four separate case study the first be land adviser who talk to about four farm their story be about shrink business as result of the family farm tax and about the potential reduction in the value of land which would mean that they would not be able to invest in their business and there would not be the tax yield that the government be bank on another local accountant give four anonymise case study of local family farm in my community of those family farm only one be earn above the minimum wage and three be earn significantly below the minimum wage in those four case two would have to sell part of their farm and two would have to sell their entire farm to pay the inheritance tax the next question be who would those farm be sell to the hon member for shipley anna dixon speak moment or two ago about the proportion of farmland be sell into private hand into private equity and so on farm will go into those hand even more as if neighbouring farmer be go to buy that land when they be in the same predicament we be see hard work farmer on less than the minimum wage have to sell off their land to private equity be that very labour thing to do the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart speak about labour not get the work class in the countryside and this be perfect example it be not too late for labour to learn it seem clear that as with the winter fuel allowance change the government have miss their target here as my hon friend rightly say it seem obvious that large landowner will have the way and mean to avoid this tax do he agree that there should be some form of work farm test yes and the government should have be think about these thing we hear from the minister that lot of planning and diligence go into this before it come out of the chancellor mouth on budget day but it do not feel like it because there be whole range of issue that could have be consider in advance there be something that will do more immediate harm to farming than even the inheritance tax change and that be the government decision to summarily reduce basic payment by in single year this will have direct impact in particular on tenant farmer who rely on that money and will end up miss their rent payment we will see eviction as consequence the government have trumpet the billion over two year which my basic math tell be billion year be always careful or nervous about make confident prediction particularly in this place but my confident prediction be that they will not spend that budget if the basic payment be cut by without the new scheme be up and run to replace they the government will not spend that money by underspend this government will end up in the same mess as the last one have huge respect for the hon gentleman my constituency neighbour but have question think the hon member for north cornwall ben maguire suggest work farm tax and it be not clear to whether the hon gentleman accept or reject that suggestion we have hear liberal democrats talk in recent week about land taxis and wealth taxis as alternative to raise the revenue to fund their many many spending commitment could the hon gentleman clarify that point to clarify my response to my hon friend the member for north cornwall ben maguire the government could have look at work farm exemption so that these people will never have to pay this inheritance tax who know the government might consider put people who be not active farmer under the hmrc microscope instead that would be far preferable to what we have grant payment be significant issue with the cut to basic payment and the government failure to be as quick as they should have be on the new payment be pretty confident that we will see an underspend from this government just as we do from the last one in recent day we have see the government decision to pause capital grant payment which will be huge blow to our farmer the area that will end up be cut or pause include hedge wall and fencing countryside stewardship grant to allow nature friendly farming work to prevent pollution of waterway slurry storage cover yard to clean up our river peatland restoration carbon storage and be the cornerstone of natural flood management my constituent matthew who farm in eden valley explain yesterday that he have just finish instal metre of fencing for nature friendly farming project the pause in the grant funding mean that he will not be able to buy any hedge plant to finish the work and nor will he get the mid tier countryside stewardship annual payment he say some say it could be pause until june this be business break issue on top of that the high level payment have not increase since enter this house in it be per hectare for moorland restoration in and it be per hectare today that be brutal attack on hill farmer and those who farm our common land again some of the sustainable farming incentive option on common land be good and they should be applaud because do more for nature be good thing but the sfi moorland option be currently close to all common land because of technical issue online we can see those consequence very clearly among all this farmer be struggle often with their mental health the isolation that people feel when their family have farm valley for generation and they might be the one who end up lose the family farm be utterly devastating however farmer just crack on with the job so our job be to be their voice farming be glorious vocation farmer work to protect our town and village from flooding to promote biodiversity to back the tourism economy to tackle climate change to underpin landscape heritage and to produce our food the fundamental failure of both the last government and this one be that they have bring together agricultural policy that actively disincentivise the production of food that be criminal and it be foolish the first thing the liberal democrats would put right be food strategy and an additional billion year for elm to back our family farmer it be time we listen to farmer such as liz and matthew staley from near kirkby stephen and their son luke and lewis regularly talk to liz and she say there be so much anguish out there for farmer on the new scheme she say they be work and there be that crossover just yet they just make it hard to make living want to encourage people on all side especially in government to listen to liz it be the vocation of farmer to save our planet and to feed our country the least we can do be give they the value and the future they deserve rise this debate be already oversubscribed to point out simple fact if you be not here for the shadow minister opening speech you will not be call that be basic etiquette represent ribble valley in lancashire one of the most beautiful constituency in the country and one of the most rural there be farm on my patch include dairy farm single out dairy farmer as probably the most passionate and dedicated farmer have encounter the problem with this motion be that it ignore the wide context of what be happen in our rural economy and will briefly talk about how remarkable those rural community be not only be our farmer vital to our food security but they often do the intangible work that we do not see on local authority balance sheet include grit and clear small road that council can not get to in winter and maintain all those beautiful countryside walking route that we all enjoy for much need rest there be endless example of how farmer be the good example of the community spirit that we be rightly so proud of in this country will share quick story about farm company in my constituency call butlers farmhouse cheese butler produce the famous blacksticks blue cheese and believe be the second large producer of cheese in the uk last year it suffer devastating fire that completely destroy its packing and logistic hub remarkably the company rebuild whole building in few week by use all of its supplier network and that be base on the faith and goodwill that farm community engender butler be able to retain the staff it have as well as support job in to local supplier these be the kind of farm we be support and we must ensure that our strategy work for they in the long term butler be fourth generation farm that would not be back on its foot today without the relationship and trust that be so embed in our rural community be excited for what westminster can do and be do for farmer we can provide clarity on the mission one of the good thing about this new labour government be our focus on overall mission for this country to be able to be clear to farmer and farming community about exactly what this labour government plan to achieve over this decade of national renewal with clear ask for farmer on how they can contribute to that mission and how they can benefit hear about the need for such clarity time and again while campaign for year farmer lack clarity under the conservative party and they desperately need it fully recognise how much the hon lady want to serve her new constituent and hope she be right do she recognise how difficult it will be for farmer in her constituency as it will be in mine to pay the inheritance tax land value be very high and the abstract capital value can be in the ten of thousand but the income that an acre of land generate can be in the hundred so there be an enormous disjunct between the value of the land in the abstract as far as his majesty revenue and customs be organise and the actual money that the farm will generate how do she think that farmer in her constituency be go to pay the inheritance tax will come on to opportunity to increase the prosperity of farmer which should be our mission the second opportunity for farmer be around procurement and trade and use the government own purchasing power to back british produce so that of food bring into hospital army basis and prison be locally produce we can protect farmer from be undercut by low welfare and low standard in trade deal and we be seek new veterinary agreement with the eu to get our export move want to touch on devolution and its ability to empower local understanding anyone who live in rural community know that part of its strength be deep generational knowledge of the land and local area nowhere be that more evident than in generational farming indeed it be that knowledge pass down through generation and train into child from the time they can walk that ensure some of the efficiency that keep our farm go be huge advocate for devolution especially for area such as lancashire where ribble valley be locate that include vast rural area because it bring democracy and understanding close to community that be huge issue that the government be progress at pace in order to do right by rural community be grateful to all the farmer who have be have open conversation with about how past and future policy have and could affect they any new government will take some time to unpick how relationship have work in the past and how they might want to change they come to westminster as someone who be passionate about local leadership and devolution and there be much that this government can do to help farmer by take decision the hon lady be make an eloquent speech about farming and the importance of farmer to our community they undertake role such as grit the road and cut our hedge as well as feed the nation we live in she talk about devolution do she agree that the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs of northern ireland have say that one third of farmer will be impact by the agricultural property tax with of our dairy farmer be the hard hit the policy be not work stop the family farm tax grab if the hon lady will allow will come to how we can help the farmer who will be affect by the measure to finish my point about devolution as an mp in an area with huge extent of rural economy it be critical to that devolution reflect our rural area as much as our metropolitan one look forward to see how the upcoming devolution white paper address that challenge town and parish council really understand our rural community and can play big role in local democracy the hon lady be make an interesting speech and be grateful for it she be right that we should import less food and use government procurement to help with that and she be right about the inter generational quality of family farm will she acknowledge that in deliver the kind of food security that her speech imply we can not have the most productive farmland eat up by large scale solar development and housing we need to protect our grade and land for the very reason she give because that allow we to deliver the food security that she and both want as the minister point out many farm will not be affect by the measure and it will not have the impact that opposition member be lead people to believe we have an opportunity to support our farmer as touch on in my response to the hon member for upper bann carla lockhart have sit down with farmer in my community and work through the issue they have take their own tax advice for example there be farm in my constituency that be worth around million so it will be liable for around year in inheritance tax over year however if we be able to increase that farmer profit by year by reduce energy price increase british supply procurement so that of public sector food come from those farm and provide well health service that ensure all member of the family can be strong and well to work that be the opportunity yes we need to make our tax structure work well that be fix the foundation but the real aim and prize be increase the opportunity for farmer so that they have the stability investment and real sense of purpose and mission that allow they not just to survive but to thrive on that point will the hon lady give way be sorry but will not speak early about the strength and efficiency in family farming from everything that have see and hear from farmer so far it be clear that while value embed way of work and learning be important there be also much appetite for innovation and do thing well will the hon lady give way will not as want to make progress just look at how farmer have lead the way in restore biodiversity and be diversify into all sort of new business venture the industry be not scared of change or opportunity but much of it rely on and be drive by what government determine be important through subsidy and trade agreement after year of uncertainty about what government want from farmer we must and will do well our farm be the lifeblood of this country along with nurse teacher and yes train driver know that farmer in my constituency of ribble valley be ready to do their bit to tackle the dire situation in which we find this country do not know group more ready to pull up their sleeve and muck in than that lot we as government be meet that energy and have similar level of ambition vision and commitment we be look at how these pillar of our community can work with we to achieve what we all strive for great prosperity for every person in this country on that point will the hon lady give way be sorry but will not the motion table by the conservatives today be not clear or specific on what they would do differently to fix the economy that along with the continual lack of clarity and consistency on rural and farming policy when they be in power suggest that they never have vision of how they would support these community well it be easy to criticise it be far hard to come up with long term vision and do the hard graft to make it reality will be vote with the government today but not because we do not need to push for more understanding of rural community in westminster generally in the uk we need well understanding of the role that farm and rural community play in our culture and potential prosperity across all party and among those who work for we be vote with the government today because we can well push for that change with labour government as part of wide plan to improve thing for everyone plan that be truly ambitious for this country and make the brave call to take the hard unpopular decision now so that in year something have actually get well for everyone would far rather have that than government who go for popular headline today but to find that in year time we be still face the same challenge that we always do and that they be get bad have lot of faith that tomorrow and over coming month this labour government will set out an exceptionally clear and visionary plan for what our rural economy mean to britain we will respect they and make the most of they by provide long term stability and clear route for farmer to contribute to our national mission and to benefit from they anyone who have wait year for labour government to come in and start to tackle the fact that quarter of our child be live in poverty know that get the result they want take time and hard work we have be in desperate need of grown up to tackle what be come down the line trust this labour government to do that and will work hard with they to get it right finally pay tribute to all the incredible farmer across ribble valley for continue the conversation with so that we can build the strong possible vision for farming and the rural economy in the uk declare my interest as work farmer and charter surveyor when drive through my constituency be always remind that farmer be the most underrated and essential worker in the rural cotswolds and many other rural area many have work the land for generation and think in particular of my constituent nigel will avoid his surname to avoid press intrusion who be still farm at the age of this government forget that farming be not hobby it be farmer who wake up at the crack of dawn to ensure that the rest of the population have food on their table who clear the road when tree fall on they or they be block by snow and who plant tree and wild flower to ensure that our biodiversity be protect for future generation the hard work farming community be deal massive blow by this labour government budget in october as my right hon friend the member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins on the front bench say this be about not only the iht change but the national insurance contribution the change in minimum wage the tax on fertiliser and an up to tax hike for double cab pick up all those extra cost take money out of business know that the chancellor and the prime minister have both state from the dispatch box that the iht change will not affect the vast majority of farm and the treasury have forecast that only of all farm will be affect however as the minister for food security and rural affairs know defra own forecast suggest that two third of farm will be affect by this destructive policy and the national farmers union have recently publish an analysis of the figure which find that it materially underestimate the true proportion with around of commercial farm to be affect that be due to the treasury use figure that be base on the agricultural property relief datum which be not representative of the current situation will the hon gentleman give way we have already have an exchange in intervention so ask the hon gentleman to first let say this about land price disagree with the point about land price be inflate we can not buck the market it be not the policy that inflate land price it be people come in from outside agriculture who be put up the price the nfu say that farm may be affect by the policy that be the language that it use take no account of estate planning or any other mitigation that people might use as the secretary of state say people take action in the event of change the nfu have ignore that in quote its statistic if the hon gentleman will just listen to my speech and the example that be about to give with an open mind he might change his mind the treasury do not include in its figure the impact of business property relief claim that also fit under the same million ceiling accord to the nfu of farmer also claim bpr on machinery and livestock which make the million ceiling even more restrictive as show in an early exchange the government have fail to complete proper impact assessment of the change to apr and bpr on the rural economy the hon member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae might be interested to hear that the cla modelling have show that the change will lead to of rural business close with up to job lose from the rural economy some in very remote area and it will be difficult to replace they will the hon gentleman give way do not want to give way to too many people but will to the hon gentleman the hon gentleman mention of agricultural business be at risk be it not true that under the last government between and there be an reduction in agricultural business in his constituency of north cotswolds thank to the policy of his party when they be in government that be over much long period but these change will take effect much quick can assure the hon gentleman that once the tax start to bite those job will be lose quite quickly to put that into perspective the obr have predict that only million year be due to be raise from this destructive policy this budget give the department for work and pensions whopping billion year the revenue raise from this tax would be mere of that total amount over the past few week have have countless email from worried farmer about their future and be lucky enough to meet some of they when they come up to london to protest recently they vary in age from their late to their early and it be valuable meeting many have never protest in their life but they have choose to use their voice now when their livelihood be under threat again to avoid press intrusion want to cite the case of david and his young son whose farm in the north cotswolds have acre suckler herd of and small flock of pedigree poll dorset sheep they have range of modern and traditional building and have already diversify those when they include their house they estimate that their business be worth million david would be entitle to about million in relief and after the relief from inheritance tax with an effective rate that the exchequer secretary go through that would leave he with taxable amount of on his death the minister might like to listen to this that farmer only earn in total on average about year how on earth be he expect to pay the tax and live on that he will not the farmer will have to sell up and the farm will not be available to future generation will the hon gentleman give way it be the last time would the tories not have lot more credibility on this issue if they own up to the disaster that be brexit it open we up to cheap import increase cost for farmer and put up barrier and obstacle to trading would they not have much more credibility in attack the government on this if they admit that that be an absolute disaster for farming community if the hon gentleman want to call an adjournment debate on brexit he be entitle to do so be talk about the serious issue of how this farmer and many other up and down the country will be able to afford the tax they will not understand that the government have suggest that farmer should be forward plan and gift their farm to their child now which would mean that they could avoid the tax in future however for many farmer that be not an option will take another constituent of mine who farm near fosse way he be still work on his farm at he do not retire at like many of we but have keep work the long hard day as he do during the second world war to ensure that we have enough food on our table he have spend year plan to ensure that his grandchild could inherit and take over the farming business instead under this government his plan have go completely out of the window because he will have to live until he be if he be to avoid the tax altogether the only option face many farmer across the country be to sell off their land and stop farm those farmer have work the land for generation their child will have see their parent take over and will have expect to take over when they can but now face future of uncertainty the government fail to answer the question of what kind of person will buy the land when it go on the market it will not be the one who have farm the land all their life it will likely be foreign investor and hedge fund manager they will not have generation of knowledge of how to work the land and will likely take prime arable land out of production as they could possibly make more money from alternative when work on the previous public accounts committee urge the minister to listen and to pledge that he will do this manage to obtain commitment from the last government that the food security index would be publish in parliament every year will the minister give that pledge so we can continue do that that way we can see what effect the tax the selling off of farm and take land out of production be have and whether our food production be drop end with plea to the government to go back to the drawing board understand that technical tax consultation on the change be due to be publish early in urge the government to use this time to talk to farmer and professional across the country and find way that will ensure that farmer such as nigel do not lose their life work to the taxman some obvious alleviation and change to apr and bpr would be to raise the threshold so that more small farm owner and rental farmer would be exempt and to have long transition period that will help farmer like year old nigel however the good outcome would be to reverse the policy altogether farming be under threat do not want to see the fabric of our countryside destroy for future generation rise at some point speak limit will be introduce so please think about edit your speech before then call andrew pakes that be quick than expect madam deputy speaker so thank you it be privilege to speak in the debate nothing go to the heart of the health wellbeing and prosperity of nation more than be able to feed and look after ourselves britain farmer and our farming workforce be part of the essential infrastructure that keep this country go be proud to represent constituency with such rich food and farming heritage farming be in our dna pay tribute to our farmer and farming workforce when we talk about any other industry we recognise the skilled worker that deliver for britain the steelworker the miner the nurse and the doctor we should start every debate on food and farm with the same recognition for farmer food security begin with the incredible work of our farmer and thank they we talk about people go the extra mile to look out for each other and care for our community farmer do that every day this should therefore be welcome debate on the future of farming it should mention farming profitability and allow the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman to talk about agri technology and how we increase profitability hope that he do so shortly instead what do we get it be political opportunism from party that should know well be proud to be part of the large contingent of rural labour mps in britain history labour members be elect to protect and support our rural community and we will do just that after year it be bit rich of conservative members now to claim that they be back britain farmer entirely endorse what the hon gentleman my constituency neighbour say about recognise and celebrate the work of farmer and indeed farm worker but do he understand be sure that most conservative members understand this well that asset and income be entirely different thing farmer asset be our landscape their wealth be our common wealth something that the government have seemingly fail to appreciate by impose tax on farmer that confuse their ability to make living with the asset that be essential for they to feed the nation thank the right hon member for be champion in this house of skill and trade union which be sadly too rarely champion by conservative members recognise his point on our common wealth and the work that go into look after and protect our land but also recognise the impact of the last government on land and our farming community let we look at the conservatives record year of run down the defra budget decade of austerity which become decade of insecurity brexit turkey half cooked flood funding cut trade deal that sell out british farmer farming budget million underspent if conservative member want to discuss food security and the future of our rural community bring it on the conservative party see more than farmer and agribusiness force out of business since farming have the low profitability of any sector in the economy conservative abolish the agricultural wages board and see rural wage stagnate as do many liberal democrat colleague who vote in the same lobby now the conservatives be defend the status quo when it come to big business big landowner and rise land price at the start of this debate think that they be literally the last people on earth defend the status quo but some of they seem to be talk about accept some kind of policy while those on the front bench seem to be say that there should be no change whatsoever so the merry go round continue the opposition want all the spending but none of the responsibility we talk about change we know the change that this country vote for in our rural and farm community people vote for change because public service be break with rural school crumble nhs waiting list soar and rural gps and nhs dentist hard to find the government be rightly focus on the cost of live crisis and improve access to gps in our rural community what be the opposition focus on they be defend tax break for estate worth up to million while attack pay rise for the low pay worker in our rural community that say everything that we need to know about today tory party as fellow cambridgeshire mp will the hon member give we some example of farm in his constituency that support the measure certainly recognise from door knock in rural community and talk to rural worker that food poverty have go up in my constituency people have find it hard to get bus to go and work on farm and people work on farm be struggle with the result of liz truss mini budget which crash our economy the reality of the debate that we should be have be that profitability for british farmer go back generation not to july that be why the government be pledge to put billion into the farming budget and be commit to work with farmer and the sector to get that money into productive food production it be why we will use the heft of public procurement to buy british farming produce food security go to the heart of the challenge face our country fix our public service go to the heart of rebuild our rural community if the house want to do both it will start by reject the opposition motion rise after the next contribution will impose time limit of five minute on speech call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee remind the house of my entry in the register of members financial interests it be pleasure to follow the hon member for peterborough andrew pakes who be fellow member of the select committee and the hon member for ribble valley maya ellis they both in their own way make an important contribution to the debate by give bit more context to it will vote for the motion in the name of the leader of the opposition not because it be the most elegant piece of draft that have see in year in the house but because there be nothing in it with which really disagree it do feel though like bit of miss opportunity to move the debate onwards say that not as any real criticism because it be response to government measure in the budget which be also bit of miss opportunity it be worth take minute or two to pause and reflect on how thing might have be do differently we could have go through the process that multiple government and departments have go through over the year by start with green paper or white paper and look at the way in which inheritance tax have work and some of the unintended consequence that it have generate we have all hear of the super rich buy up land and inflate the price as some sort of tax avoidance measure have not meet single work farmer who want to defend that so there be real opportunity to do thing differently we could have build consensus about the proper value of land and about some stuff that be not really be speak about in this debate speak as former solicitor thankfully never do any executory practice but some of those who be still in practice and with whom be in contact tell candidly that because there be relief on agricultural land they do not really give great deal of thought to the valuation that go into the application for confirmation that be bind to have have an impact on the figure on which the government rely have we do thing in proper and reflective way we would have be able to build consensus on value and threshold for example and do thing very differently welcome the contribution of my former ministerial colleague have the tax be levy on exactly the people he describe the super rich and non work farmer few would have complain but it have be set at the wrong level that be why ask for detailed modelling to be make available to the house think just say more or less exactly that debate of the sort that be talk about would have allow for wide debate about farming finance we have have year of very direct government intervention in the agricultural economy through farm subsidy take step back critical though those farm subsidy be their net effect have ultimately be to keep farmer poor there be now such an enormous mismatch between the capital value of the asset be farm and the derisory return on they defra tell we that there be return on capital farmer in my constituency tell that million farm will give they an income of about year that be pretty much in line with defra figure we hear about farmer work into their it be slightly patronising and very romantic view of doughty farmer work on into their because they be seize with sense of vocation there absolutely be sense of vocation among farmer but let we not forget that lot of they work into their and because they have be run business that have have no spare money to put into pension so that they can look after themselves in their old age the right hon gentleman make an important point about just how little farmer earn and yet they be consistently be describe by labour members as asset rich should farmer not fall into their definition of work people and therefore labour should be on their side rather than what they be do to they work people hardly do justice to farmer some of my young constituent tell they be work for return of about an hour there be reason choose not to become farmer at and why think law be more attractive career opportunity to pursue but bow to no one in my admiration for those who make that choice of course there be the question of those who have make their estate planning decision on the basis of apr be available other have point to that but it be absolutely critical and it go beyond estate planning wonder how many farmer over the year decide in divorce settlement to take the farm as their part of the capital because they have familial and emotional connection to the land and be now find that what look like an equitable settlement few year ago risk be much more inequitable the particular opportunity fear we have miss be that in relation to tenant farmer the tenant farmers association come up with an excellent proposal which would reward landlord who grant lease in excess of year with exemption from inheritance tax liability that would be good for the very people who everybody on both side of the house say they want to help the small family farmer there be multiple reason why people might buy up agricultural land do not know anybody who take an agricultural tenancy thinking that it will make they member of the super rich as result the idea that be be moot of clawback something on which we could see bit of sensible discussion and consensus between the front benches or the idea of suspend inheritance tax liability which would crystallise only at the point of the land sale after the death of the owner would both work to keep land in active food production the irony of the way in which the government have structure the measure be that by allow relief on farmland above million the purchase of agricultural land will probably remain an attractive proposition for the super rich we have reach point in the debate where we need to broaden it out beyond just inheritance tax and look at the wide question of farming finance and ask ourselves how we can build consensus that put farming and food production at the heart of the countryside where it truly belong now with speak limit of five minute call matt bishop my constituency be very rural one with farm it be an extremely important issue to my constituent and hear their concern and deeply empathise with their worry and fear while it be difficult decision for the government to introduce an inheritance tax it be one that be unfortunately necessary welcome the opportunity from the opposition to debate the matter largely because it allow we the time to discuss the reason why inheritance tax have to be introduce there be crucial need to understand the unique challenge face by rural community and the immense value they add to society farmer across the country and most definitely in my constituency be not just farmer they help in number of different situation include recently with the flood in the forest of dean they be vital to all of we in the community however the economic turmoil of the past year have leave the government with the difficult task of balance the need of the british people with the economic reality of run the country the failure of the previous government to secure brexit deal that protect the interest of farmer leave many in vulnerable position struggle with increase cost trade barrier and uncertainty this government new deal for farm aim to safeguard farmer interest and we will do all we can to support they we be use the government purchase power to ensure that of food consume in hospital army basis and prison be from british farmer put more money in their pocket we be introduce grid reform allow farmer to plug their renewable energy into the national grid we be also seek new veterinary agreement with the eu to ensure that our friend on the continent can enjoy the incredible produce that britain have to offer this government be actively work to improve the life of farmer in way that will benefit the agricultural sector and the broad economy will the hon member accept that the change to inheritance tax damage the economic reality in the uk because farmer will be disincentivise from invest in their land and increase its productivity although empathise with the hon member comment that be not exactly what hear from the farmer in my constituency which will get on to shortly the impact of brexit include trade barrier labour shortage and disruption in supply chain have undeniably place significant pressure on our farmer it be somewhat ironic that the opposition choose to complain about this government action when it be their failure that create this mess the nfu even criticise defra as recently as september for significant underspending amount to million over the past three year my constituent and more importantly today farmer in the forest of dean have feel the impact of the challenge first hand small business and family be all face tough time and the opposition must acknowledge the broad context the new initiative that the government be introduce from the support for british farmer to green energy reform be vital step forward and do not underestimate the difficulty that lie ahead for all of we there be no quick fix for the challenge we face and fully recognise the pain and frustration feel by those who be struggle especially in rural area such as mine but the government focus be on long term growth sustainability and provide the tool that our farmer need to thrive it be inaccurate to say as have be raise that no farmer agree with this policy some farmer agree with it they want well service and they be happy to accept that reform need to take place some might be surprised to hear that agree with the leader of the opposition recent comment to the medium remind we of the profound impact of the rise cost of live on individual across the uk and farmer she be correct that the impact be feel deeply and intensely by all in the country include my constituent and farmer in the forest of dean but let we not forget one important factor it be under the previous conservative government that the cost of living crisis begin for farmer it be under this government that it will end the government have make many claim about this policy that be not credible but wish to address only four first they outrageously claim that they would not do it the secretary of state the right hon member for streatham and croydon north steve reed say last year we have no intention of change apr he say that give the situation that farmer be in government can not possibly go to people and demand more taxis be sorry he be not here today to hear his own word secondly the government claim the change be unavoidable as they desperately need the million they claim that it will raise the million that they give to farm overseas and the billion that they be all too happy to hand over to public sector union say otherwise thirdly the government claim that these people be rich that completely misunderstand agriculture and the countryside farm be not an asset on balance sheet our farmer be steward of their land hold it for the next generation and the generation after that it be not the fault of farmer especially those in place such as my constituency in kent with its astronomical house price that their land be so valuable in way that do not at all reflect their farm profitability be the hon member like slightly irate when she hear uk government ministers talk about how the term of the propose agricultural property relief be much more favourable than the rate that other people have to pay inherit the family farm be not like inherit your mother house you do not liquidate the asset and then live the high life you just get on with the job that you be do the day before and the day before that there be no enrichment involve make the government policy utterly baseless could not agree more with the hon gentleman my farmer tell that these inheritance tax bill will take decade of profit to pay off so they will keep do the job that they be do yesterday but with fraction of the cash that they have before which be not lot to begin with finally want to address the idea that farmer can simply give farm away and live another seven year it be incredible that the government should introduce tax in one breath and encourage people to avoid it in the next and it make mockery of the whole policy if it be true then the tax will not raise any money for the government but instead increase bureaucracy and advisory fee for farmer mostly though for many people it be not an option or it will not work people have not be give enough time to plan for these change my constituent ross grow hop in tenterden as he watch the budget his father who be in his be suffer from sepsis and fight for his life in hospital especially in farming our most dangerous industry people can not guarantee that they will live another seven year after have hand over the farm another of my constituent be in remission have recently recover from cancer if the cancer return it be likely to be terminal this constituent be in their early be the government seriously suggest that my constituent should hand over not just the farm but the home that they live in to their teenage child many of my farmer live in their farmhouse and be plan to work the rest of their day they do not have pension they do not have plan that would allow they to spend the last decade of their life of course it may be much more no long farm the land that they have farm for the whole of their life up until this point finally to raise point that seem to have be almost entirely ignore do this will incur eye water capital gain tax bill for some of my farmer it will mean hundred of year worth of land revaluation that they similarly can not afford to pay be the hon lady aware that the capital gain tax start from the moment of person decease not from when they buy that land what have be tell by my farmer base on the tax advice that they have be give be that the bill and not just the inheritance tax on decade of profit will be completely unaffordable farming be hard it be not like any other industry it be culture and way of life it be lonely revenue be uncertain profit be tiny and cash be tight will the hon lady give way will not as be come to the end of my speech it be absurd and shameful that this government look to fund their union pay rise and vanity energy project be put this pressure on those who do the back break work of grow our food farmer already have appal problem with mental health and suicide the royal agricultural benevolent institution tell we that third of farmer may be depressed and half may be suffer from anxiety one of my farmer say that his father be now keep up at night by the thought that he will leave his child crippling debt that will make their life financially impossible another tell that his father say that he just hop that he die before the change come in this policy be illogical inconsistent dishonest and wrong to misquote brian clough would not say that my constituency be the most beautiful in the country but it be certainly in the top one we have generation of farmer to thank for that beauty those who protect the land and nurture nature long before the peak district be designate britain first national park if think for one second that these change to agricultural property relief threaten future generation of farmer in my constituency would not vote for they but do not last month spend very enjoyable afternoon score the senior young farmer at radnor young farmer club these be really admirable young people who spend their afternoon and evening look after youngster often those as young as and try to encourage they into farming be the hon gentleman not concerned about the message that this change send to our young farmer no the message from this government be that we be commit to farming and to make it profitable and sustainable that have to be the message that we send out to those young farmer there be no doubt that farmer in my constituency have be struggle terribly for the past year work seven day week hour day for very little reward the last government promise they the earth but leave they in the sheep dip after all the brexit promise what they get be the leader of the opposition sell they out in trade deal with new zealand and australia boris johnson promise farmer that subsidy would stay at but then the government phase out the basic farm payment the opposition incompetence see farmer miss out on million that could have be in their back pocket when they desperately need it and then come liz truss her mini budget and all those unfunded tax cut point that will return to crash the economy cause interest rate to rise and drive many farmer to the brink over farmer and agricultural business be lose under the last government so we will not take any lecture from the opposition about the farming industry the hon gentleman have farm in his constituency how many of those farmer will thank he for support the government today live in one of the rural village and speak to the farmer in my village all the time the fact be that those farmer vote for because they be so let down by the last government rise will not take any more intervention at the moment before the budget sit down with farmer in my constituency they want to talk about two thing first they be concern about the effect of the change to apr on family farm will the hon gentleman give way no will not secondly they be concern about cut to the farming budget the chancellor deliver billion for the farming budget the large ever investment in sustainable food production and nature recovery and she deliver in term of protect family farm in my constituency will the hon gentleman give way no will not give way at this stage let we be clear only of estate in this country pay inheritance tax as we have repeatedly hear these change will mean that couple will be able to leave million worth of estate to their child without pay penny in inheritance tax to put that in context if couple own million mansion they would be pay in inheritance tax rise will not give way at this stage those estate over the threshold will have reduction in the amount they pay we have already hear that the seven year rule will continue to apply so farming family will be able to make plan for the future will the hon gentleman give way sorry will not give way at this stage this debate have however shine an important light on one issue which be grateful to the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for raise the fact that our farmer be work day in day out for very little profit the question be how we support they to be profitable again energy bill be one of the big cost farm business face this government will help bring down those cost through gb energy and by introduce grid reform to allow farmer to plug renewable into the national grid we must protect they from be undercut by foreign import will the hon gentleman give way be sorry but will not we must create great marketplace for farming business by use the government purchase power to ensure that of the food buy for our hospital prison and army basis be produce by local farmer here be the most important point we have to provide farming business with economic stability the leader of the opposition have already fail to learn the lesson of the liz truss budget with billion of unfunded tax cut already announce in matter of week the opposition need to tell we how they be go to pay for that what be they go to cut be they go to cut the farming budget be we go to lose the billion from the farming be they go to borrow and put we right back in the position we be in with liz truss with interest rate rise and farm go out of business will not be vote for the opposition motion will be support farmer in my constituency and provide the economic stability they need share the frustration of my right hon friend shadow secretary of state that the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs can not be with we today want to offer he some sympathy because do not believe that either he or the farming minister cook up this terrible plan it be thrust on they by the treasury because as have be say before the treasury know the price of everything and the value of nothing it clearly do not know the value of family farm or the value of our farmer to this country the purpose of this policy as be outline by the chancellor in her budget statement be to stop wealthy individual avoid inheritance tax but to protect family farm as my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson say the cla have highlight that the average acre arable farm own by couple would have to spend of its yearly profit over decade to afford an inheritance tax bill more starkly single farmer with acre would have to pay of their yearly profit to cover the bill clearly that be unaffordable real life example be send to by constituent he be farmer whose elderly father be still alive but no long work and whose son be at local agricultural college and hop one day to follow in his footstep such an inheritance tax bill make his farm unviable and put his son future in doubt his father be distraught he say to his wife that morning what be the point of even go to work have have correspondence from an agricultural accountant in my constituency who say that since the budget his job have change from be an accountant to be counsellor as more and more farmer contact he with serious concern about their mental health because of the fear that have be introduce by this policy and the fact that their child be now tell they that they do not want to go into the family farm my right hon friend be absolutely correct farming be lonely existence at time and farmer have traditionally suffer from mental health difficulty this policy be make thing far bad and for small family farm it really be devastating as other in the house have say tenant have not be take into account in any of this the impact of business property relief be far great than any of we have discuss so far because it do not just relate to farm it relate to any unquoted business which could be local haulier an abattoir or feed merchant all of these the tapestry of our agricultural economy be impact by these measure it really be devastating attack on our way of life if we take the treasury figure which show that million will be take each year by these taxis that be million that will no long be spend in the rural economy for example farmer who want to expand his livestock herd need to build new shed and that mean pay planning consultant construction firm mechanic and an electrician it mean great feed bill for his new livestock and he have to buy the livestock all of those thing be part of the wide economy it be not just the farmer who will be hit by this policy it be everyone in rural community the secretary of state tell we at the environment food and rural affairs committee that it will all be fine because farm under his tutelage will become more profitable the only way to make farm profitable that quickly be by greatly increase food price if we be to go down the route of food inflation and of inflation more widely then fine but the government be go to have to explain that to consumer in the supermarket do my hon friend agree that as part of labour members total failure to understand the countryside they probably do not get that farmer be one of the very few sector that have to buy retail but sell wholesale my hon friend be absolutely correct farmer be of course price taker not price setter and they have always be under great pressure from the retail chain to keep their price to minimum so that we can all enjoy cheap food that be fact of life and very difficult challenge my colleague on the select committee have great expertise on the farming industry he will therefore know that for the last year the record of his party in government have be one of failure for our farming industry with farm close since and energy bill skyrocket because the conservative party fail to invest in energy independence hit our farmer and reduce profitability we be go to have to agree to disagree on that point frankly this be policy dream up by the treasury on spreadsheet there have be no impact assessment and there be no understanding of its impact on rural community this be not just an assault on farmer it be an attack on the entire agricultural economy the end result will be less british food reduce british food security and few british job will the minister please give our farmer some hope this christmas and look at this again must admit that as new member and novice when it come to the fine detail of parliamentary procedure be surprised that we be debate this issue in this way today as the opposition know the agricultural property relief measure announce in the budget be not include in the budget vote last month they also know that the measure will be include in future finance bill alongside other measure that will be subject to the technical consultation in the new year this decision be simply not be make today despite the disingenuous social medium post that imply otherwise this detail matter to because have spend the last few week speak to farmer in penrith and solway to try to understand the full impact of the inheritance tax proposal know that have month leave to engage with defra and the treasury and to seek important amendment let be clear if today be the real vote would vote against the government plan be no rebel be moderate but during the election read what think be assurance from my party that we have no plan to introduce change to apr on that basis reassure farmer in my constituency that we would not and now simply be not prepared to break my word be tell that there be no labour mp in the country with as many farm as have in penrith and solway and hope my colleague will understand my feeling on this today however we be debate frankly irrelevant motion from the conservatives the motion fail to acknowledge how they fail to deliver for my farmer how they fail to deliver on trade deal after brexit and how they set budget for new rural payment scheme but could not make the scheme accessible they make manifesto commitment for the public sector to buy british that never materialise and they fail to spend flood prevention money that be desperately need by my farmer on the solway plain they fail to deliver reform of inheritance tax rule that farmer know be be abuse by non farmer at their expense simply will not walk into lobby with people who talk good game on farming but do not deliver their motion start with the word that this house regret yet year of failure do not even get whisper listen to the member speech very closely paragraph of erskine may state formerly the house strictly observe rule against anticipation that be design to restrict debate on subject to the type of proceeding deem to be the most effective as the word formerly suggest the rule be no long strictly observe and have not be for many year the principal provision in the budget relate to agricultural property relief be not contain in the finance bill currently before the house so the question of anticipation do not arise in any case be firmly of the view that any absolute rule should not prevent member whether act individually or as party from hold the government to account hope that that satisfy the member it be not point for he to respond to right now rise to join conservative colleague in call on the labour government to stop this farm tax it be pleasure to follow the hon member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours and to have hear what he say about those false promise before the general election perhaps he too want his government to think again about what they be do the other week thousand of farmer take the extraordinary step of come to westminster to protest against this misguided policy unfortunately the government have put their head in the sand and be pursue this policy hope this debate will make they think again and make they listen give the exchequer secretary out of for appear in the chamber today even though he be junior minister at the treasury he certainly pull the short straw by be put on the front bench today ask ministers not just to come here but to listen to what be be say and to really listen to the need of our farming community we have hear lot today about what british farmer do they be steward of the land guardian of our food security and the backbone of the rural economy yet the government show fundamental lack of understanding of how their policy will affect the industry they be push ahead with it even though it jeopardise not just farmer livelihood but the very future of our countryside the number speak for themselves while the government claim that only of farm will be affect the national farmers union have warn that of family farm will be affect if be in government and see the discrepancy between those number would go back to the drawing board check the figure and ask why those discrepancy be there not dig in deeply think the curse of this labour government and what they will be remember for be their distinct lack of grasp of detail and of how the economy work rural and otherwise interruption yes this budget have be disaster of budget my right hon friend be make excellent point do she agree that there be not only lack of grasp of detail but an astounding sense of arrogance an inability to listen to those who know what they be do the farmer and who have the experience and the expertise there be just blank inexplicable unwillingness by this government to listen to the voice of expertise and of experience thank my hon friend for bring that point to the house this debate allow those on the labour benches to say actually let go back to the drawing board let look at this discrepancy in the number for all their talk of growth return to the budget this government policy be deliver the exact opposite of growth with the change to employer national insurance contribution and the change to right from day one they be talk down the economy and crush growth in the economy with the forecast be revise to be low than it be even if the government do not want to hear this from and even if they do not want to hear it from the farmer want they to hear it from labour support tax expert dan neidle he have eventually come to the conclusion that labour farm tax be dog dinner of policy originally dan have criticise what he see as over the top coverage of the impact these tax change would have but he say that on close inspection he have reverse his decision remark that these budget change would hit farmer too hard and tax avoider too lightly he argue that the policy need to change dan neidle have say that the treasury should raise the inheritance tax cap dramatically to around million so only the large and most sophisticated farm business become subject to iht those on the labour benches might not want to listen to but hope they will listen to one of their own tax expert moment ago we hear talk from the liberal democrat benches of family farm tax and land taxis it now seem that the right hon lady be suggest we take up dan neidle suggestion will she confirm whether that be the case it would be good if member listen to what say say it be not too late for labour to reverse this policy even their own tax adviser be say on close inspection it need to be reverse that be what be ask those on the government benches to do we have hear today that farmer be asset rich but in reality they be cash poor and that be the crux of the matter before we today in the time have leave will mention couple of farmer from my constituency seventh generation farmer tell she be hop to pass her farm on to the eighth generation but that now do not seem possible because if they have to sell proportion of the land which they will that will make the whole farm be unviable another farmer of mine richard shepherd few year ago build state of the art cow cubicle shed for their dairy herd piece of modern technology he believe would prepare the farm for the challenge of the century invest in method to produce high quality affordable and nutritious food the type of innovation this country will come to rely on for food security in the future however now with this change from the labour government he will owe between and over million in inheritance tax he have say that like any other business we need confidence to invest in our farm that what we want to do we want to grow our farm invest in it and this will destroy this richard barnett an accountant who work with many farmer in my constituency have warn of two immediate consequence of these propose change first there will be an increase in the number of individual seek to acquire farmland up to million to mitigate inheritance tax result in reduction in the amount of tax that the treasury can expect to generate from this policy as well as an increase in land price secondly he expect consequence of these change to be that the financial industry will enter the land market with individual invest up to million in farmland acquire it and then we will see farmland be lose order call callum anderson associate myself with the excellent speech by my hon friend the members for ribble valley maya ellis for peterborough andrew pakes and for forest of dean matt bishop who be all absolutely right to say that this government be commit to stand shoulder to shoulder with british farmer and ensure their voice be hear and their future be secure nowhere be this more vital than in buckinghamshire where farming be not just an industry but an integral part of our local identity it support our economy shape our landscape and be weave into the fabric of our community since be elect in july have engage closely with farmer across north buckinghamshire and have be grateful to meet local agricultural and rural business in my constituency such as boycott farm in stowe and hogshaw farm and wildlife park thank they for welcome to their world these visit have reinforce my commitment to represent their interest and address the challenge they face have be strike this afternoon as listen to speech from across the house by the inability of the conservatives to confront and defend their own record in office time and again the previous government fail to stand up for buckinghamshire farmer as have be say they fail to spend million of the uk agricultural budget and that money should have go straight into the pocket of buckinghamshire farmer instead the conservatives leave it on the table not because it be not need but because they could not be bother to make sure that their policy to replace the basic payment scheme be complete on time that be their attitude when in office the gap and the unanswered question in the scheme leave many farmer in my constituency in limbo undermine their confidence and threaten their livelihood when in government the opposition fail again when they negotiate trade deal with australia and new zealand remove most tariff on beef and lamb even the conservative cabinet member responsible for negotiate the deal say it be bad one these deal have open the floodgate to import that threaten to undercut our domestic producer leave british farmer struggle to compete against low welfare and low cost alternative our farmer deserve well that be why this government be determined to do thing differently we have commit as other have say billion to the farming budget over the next two year that be the large investment in sustainable food production in our history because we know that food security be national security in the come year alone billion will go directly to support british farmer ensure that they can thrive in rapidly change and uncertain world will the hon member give way would be happy to be there not too little time these investment be about more than money they represent vision for resilient and sustainable future on the inheritance tax point the government approach be balanced and fair will the hon member give way will not on this occasion just last night the former conservative chancellor lord clarke agree with our approach say that he be team chancellor he say it be strange exemption which be why so many rich people buy agricultural land he be not wrong as other have say in the top of wealthy claimant account for of the total value of apr at cost of million to the taxpayer as my hon friend the member for rugby john slinger say the majority of claimant will not be affect couple inherit farm can still pass up to million tax free and any additional asset will be tax at half the standard rate with payment spread over year this government be deliver new deal square deal for farmer include measure to ensure that british produce be prioritise in government procurement that farmer be not undercut by low welfare import and that energy cost be reduce through innovative solution our farmer deserve government who listen support and invest in they and this government be commit to do just that rise to speak on behalf of mid norfolk rural agricultural food process constituency that be reel from this surprise and savage attack that be not in the labour manifesto have no direct interest in farming but be the child of farming family my stepbrother run that business work on farm from the age of to be go to go into farm management and think still have place at harper adams agricultural college if this career do not work out my first job be with the nfu work here in parliament be director of elsoms seeds and be proud as minister to lead the agritech industrial strategy be chair of the all party parliamentary group on science and technology in agriculture this be hugely important strategic industry to the uk it be key to our food security now gratifyingly government priority and it be completely key to the world ability to feed billion mouth we be great agricultural research and technology economy and the world be hungry for our innovation agriculture be also completely key to net zero agriculture and transport be the two dirty industry and agriculture be move more quickly than any pioneer regenerative system of agriculture and carbon capture system those innovation be be drive by new generation of young uk farmer who be different from the post war generation they take their responsibility to the broad planet and regenerative agriculture seriously at the same time as agriculture be key strategic industry farmer look after our countryside and keep our rural economy healthy all of those be achieve in the most extraordinary way in an industry not dominate by big company this industry be make up of million of small business moreover they exist in the most extraordinary business climate they operate on incredibly expensive asset the land which they never seek to monetise as colleague have point out in an industry in which their cost be fix they invest in all their cost up front and wait hopefully for price for their product which be subject to the vagary of the weather and of climate change most business people look at that business model would say that be not business want to be in why do our family farmer do it they do it because it be way of life and because it be deeply embed in the value of their family their countryside and their community it be about stewardship and it make it all the more remarkable that this government have decide to attack that very bit of the agricultural economy what be the aim of this policy what be the impact of this policy how should this house and those mp who understand the rural economy respond if the government have say our aim be to close the loophole of land asset speculator enjoy the legitimate family tax relief that the conservatives put in place in probably would have support they if they have say we want to stop international hedge fund enjoy tax relief design to protect family farm suspect many of we would have support they if they have say we want to support new entrant to the industry to promote diversified regenerative agriculture to increase investment and to promote the vibrant rural economy probably would have support they that however be not the aim of this policy the truth be that we do not know its aim because the policy be never in the government manifesto and it be not from defra it be treasury policy that have be land on unwitte ministers who be now have to carry the can we know it be anti small business anti family business and anti the rural economy the former labour adviser john mcternan let the cat out of the bag he say that labour have wait long time to seek revenge for the tory attack on the miner and it be go to attack the farming community that be exactly what he say the impact of the policy be clear we only have to read the cla and nfu briefing have meet gavin lane phil and sophie ellis oliver munday and nigel stangroom most of our average family farm will have to pay tax bill of or where will they get the money when the business do not generate the profit to pay those bill they will all have to sell land but who will buy it it will not be their neighbour because they will be sell land too fear that this policy be design in the treasury with the support of bit of the department for energy security and net zero and defra the people hang over mid norfolk wait to buy the land be the big solar developer and the big mass housing developer will the hon member give way will not as time be short and colleague want to speak this policy be prescription for the industrialisation of the countryside cook up in the treasury in the summer when nobody be look it will lead to family farm be break up and sell farm investment fall and young farmer leave with major economic impact and tertiary impact in my part of the world those industry that support farming be already see the effect the response of rural mps should be to move fast behind the hon member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours and make it clear to the treasury that it need to adjust the mechanism change the threshold and change this policy unless labour want to be the party of rural devastation it be always privilege to speak on behalf of my constituency which be the large in england and one of the most rural start by pay tribute to the farmer have engage with both as labour candidate have my selection meeting at hexham farmer market and since have be elect whether in london on their individual farm through the nfu or otherwise have have genuinely balance and informative conversation about they and have share the outcome of those conversation with ministers and through the appropriate channel what really strike be that this be an unserious motion bring by an unserious party one that fail to understand the countryside and fail to understand why it lose seat that it have hold in the case of hexham for year the conservative party undermine the confidence of young people to remain in the community where they grow up and it cry foul at any attempt to provide housing in my local community spend this morning meeting with hexham community partnership to talk about the appalling overcrowding in hexham and the need for genuinely affordable housing the problem be have devastating effect force people out of the town they grow up in the conservatives have oversight of that in my part of the world for year they need to look in the mirror and genuinely consider why rural community turn against they so much will the hon member give way will the vast expanse of green on the opposition benches remind of the british countryside do the hon member think that perhaps the reason the good people of hexham vote for he be because they be promise explicitly that his government would not do what they be currently do when we start new job and find that the previous person in that job have not pay invoice for the previous year and deliberately withhold financial information we have an honest conversation with the public about what be achievable in any business we have to be honest with people about deliverable interruption well ultimately people in my constituency be sick of the chaos they be sick of see liz truss plaster all over the newspaper when speak to my farmer hear real cry for security and genuine forward planning from defra that listen and be not turn into political football as it be too often by the conservatives know have grow up in rural community alongside the child of farmer that they value road that be not full of pothole stable economy and library that be not fall down exactly the public service that every one of we expect will the hon gentleman set out how many farmer he have speak to since the budget and of those how many support the government policy the hon member be welcome to come and take look at my diary at some point on the saturday after the budget go to farm on the second saturday after the budget go to farm then meet with nfu member at my office in london believe labour member work their constituency lot hard than tory members hope that my hon friend see as fellow labour mp who work his constituency hard and speak to resident farmer tell that they be concerned about rural crime we can all agree that something that defra have get right under the labour government be tackle rural crime and the rural crime strategy in particular do farmer speak to he about that as they do to they absolutely do my hon friend be right what people not just farmer speak to about be the need for that grow stable economy they be infuriate with the conservative party for pretend to jump on bandwagon after take farmer for grant for year while in government before the budget the hon member will remember attend westminster hall debate that organise specifically on agricultural property relief and business property relief will he agree that the conservatives have not jump on that since the budget we have be speak about it for very long time thank the hon member for her intervention she and must have slightly different view of very long time few week ago be not very long time for be talk about year in which local farming community be ignore the botched brexit deal that the conservative party secure do not do any farmer any favour labour be the only party that be genuinely serious about countryside renewal we can not pack community across northumberland in aspic and pretend that they do not need house or service that be why the conservatives lose that be why be here will the hon member give way have take plenty of intervention in short time ultimately the government will be judge on the success of our record and whether we can get the farming budget into the pocket of farmer have every faith that the government and defra will do that do not believe that the conservative party could honestly say that it ever trust its defra ministers to do the same rise to support the many farmer in my constituency and the rural community that farmer be the very heart of want to do something little different in this debate and try to figure out what be behind some of the move that the labour party have put in place when it come to farming hon member what about brexit believe be come to that but want to try to understand little bit about the government motif what think it come down to be clumsy attempt to try to define what work people be it be clear that farmer do not fit that bill even though they work hour day in backbreake condition mainly outdoors right into old age they just do not seem to fit into that particular clique labour have always have an urban centric view of our country everything it do in politic be view mainly through metropolitan lens farmer have never really have chance with this labour government it should come as no surprise know why labour members shout down the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman that someone as thoroughly unpleasant and john mcternan tony blair former aide would say something like farmer should receive the same as what margaret thatcher dish out to the miner think his view that we could do without our farming industry have just little currency in the labour party labour members would do well to be honest about these thing for our comrade on the government benches farmer be simply not one of we the last time we have whole cohort of labour members on the government benches we would mercilessly tease they that there be nae ferm in scottish labour two thing about that quite unjust slight first they do not respond they do not seem to care it be matter of whatevs and secondly it be patently untrue there be lot of farm in scottish labour and there be with the cohort down here great number of scottish labour mps represent rural and farming constituency but the point remain the same they just do not care about what happen to farmer think the general view be that labour mp do not rely on rural farming vote they could just about muddle through their election without the support of the rural community they see farming as just another business that they might find in one of their town or city centre they understand nothing about how it be possible to be asset rich and resource poor land value and the intimate nature of family farm which be dependent on fix asset to generate business and activity the simple fact be that this government do not understand the rural community or how the generational continuity of farm work and now load of new labour mps represent rural constituency in england rural labour members of parliament do not tend to last all that long they may be in for one term or possible two term at most that be generally because they be force to accept and subsume the agenda put forward by their government my bit of advice to they be to start think about the farmer and their community start to think about their own electoral arithmetic and try to be on the side of farmer for change can not believe what be hear be four time member of parliament for semi rural seat have first be elect in the hon member be just talk nonsense have never hear anything like it be bit familiar with the hon gentleman electoral history he be out of parliament for quite long time it be good to see he back in his place obviously but he be boot out which be basically down to his lack of interest concern or care about what be happen in the rural community if be nfu england would be sure to put that in front of the members of parliament who represent rural constituency in england have couple of bit of advice for some of the uk farmer and their representative first of all jeremy clarkson be not their friend he represent the part of the rural community that be so far away from the real struggle that farmer face that he may as well be in an urban labour constituency secondly farmer must be very careful of what the conservative party be offer let we remember that the conservative party oversee the cost of living crisis the ending of thousand of farm and who to come to the point make by hon member bring in the absurd and economically illiterate brexit the tory hard brexit increase farming cost introduce unnecessary barrier to market allow low quality competitor in the marketplace and have take billion of pound out of the rural economy how the tories be able to sell this chaotic brexit pup to so many rural community will go down as one of the bad piece of mis selling in british farming there be different way to do it in scotland we do thing differently we be make sure that there will be constant farm payment to farmer in scotland we have also put food production at the very heart of our farming policy today in the scottish budget as well as introduce winter fuel payment we will abolish the two child benefit cap on top of that million will be go to farmer all the money that be keep for government emergency in the past few budgets will be return in full that be how the government can support farmer it would be good to see this labour government do bit of that in the future welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and be grateful that the conservatives after many year of ignore farmer have finally decide to pay attention to farming and food security farming play vital role in the past present and future of north northumberland there be almost farm across northumberland in my constituency and that of my hon friend the member for hexham joe morris each of they proudly and patiently shape the landscape that we view as quintessentially british and they play crucial role in sustain local community farmer be good for north northumberland since become member of parliament have spend great deal of time meet they and represent their concern in parliament in fact my first non maiden speech be on the virtue and challenge of sheep farming have do that because understand as the government do that farming be central both to the community represent and to our way of life in the uk put simply our country can not flourish without flourish farming sector farming have be batter for year under previous government as be prepare for this debate read recent letter from farming constituent about range of difficulty he face for many year government intervention have always dominate the top of my risk register due to inconsistent policy and its oft re enforce reputation as poor payer it would be convenient for the conservatives if farmer across the uk be to forget about the past year and blame all the current difficulty on government who have be in office for just six month however create reputation for government as poor payer and have inconsistent policy take year not month in july the competition and markets authority find that the squeeze inflict on our food supply chain be combination of significant rise in energy commodity and labour cost make bad in some case by adverse movement in the exchange rate in other word farmer have be squeeze for year by energy price labour cost and depreciation of the pound and the previous government bear some responsibility for all those factor in april the energy and climate intelligence unit find that since russia invasion of ukraine the government have enact only three out of policy necessary to improve energy security and bring price down in the long term which speak to year of failure on energy whether that be sell off gas storage capacity dodge tough decision on nuclear or go cool on the urgency of global warming by ban onshore wind when global energy fluctuate the lack of long term preparation leave our farmer expose to rocket price another matter would like to raise be the issue of large retailer at time let down our farmer they be able to dominate negotiation around own label product and with of farm produce vegetable be sell by supermarket farmer be stick in monopoly position that threaten their business urge the government to do what they can to ensure reliable pricing and supply arrangement can be set between farmer and retailer that benefit our national food security there be also the issue of subsidy we need to get the money out the door to farmer and make sure they can actually get the funding that they do not get under the previous government will finish by mention another of the issue we have talk about today on apr there be need for continue constructive engagement around the recently announce propose reform while every farmer have speak to welcome the proposal to end taxpayer subsidy for the super wealthy buy up land in order to avoid inheritance tax be aware that the government be face two compete responsibility the first manage the national finance and the second be ensure that every community can follow its tradition and dream as farmer recently write to despite all that be throw at my father over the year all he ever want to do be farm and he love it somehow it be in his blood know the government understand this urge the minister to continue to keep that front and centre as we support the contribution of farmer to our national life after many year of ineptitude neglect and the doling out of crumb by the conservatives it must be labour that truly become the party of farming and rural life as many member know be able to speak with some expertise on this subject as be the first female director of the nfu in some year and now represent constituency in which have live for year where there be farm or holding the country land and business association say that of those farm will be affect by the measure be know as somebody who try to reach across the chamber and make friend with hon member on both side do not particularly enjoy confrontation so there be element of the debate that have find unpleasant and disappointing do not like the reference to class come from the labour benches or the suggestion that it have anything to do with class come from hon member on the conservative benches that be an irrelevance please do not play politic with my farmer they be too important my plea to the minister when he be listen be that he look again be not ask he to change the policy understand that it be treasury drive at some thing that need to be look at again it be flawed assumption that ownership be split between spouse that be not the case across exmoor and if it be not the case especially in cross generational farming family where old farmer hold on to the property so as not to burden the young generation with increase capital gain tax on any future sale should they wish then the relief state by the chancellor will not add up to the value state another flawed assumption be that average family farm be worth under million they be not be grateful to my constituent and good friend guy thomas everard who go out of his way to give the bill of sale for perfectly average farm outside winsford in my constituency it be value at million and that be before we count the deadstock and the livestock will the hon lady give way no another flawed assumption be that the residential nil rate band will be applicable if the value of the farm business be worth over million there be no residential nil rate band so that swallow up large number of family farm know that many member be very very unhappy indeed with the proposal the hon member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours say he will vote with the government because of the dire state that the former government leave farmer and agriculture in but he be right when he say that this be flawed piece of legislation it will devastate family farm implore and beg the minister to look at it again and at least to get the fact right all government have to make tough decision face with billion black hole labour have choose to raise taxis on only the very wealthy the conservatives record be instead to choose to place the burden on the poor in society those with disability and those who be very young in fact be see that in real time in derbyshire as the conservative leader of derbyshire county council have choose not to spend his time deal with the disastrous recent ofsted report on the sorry state of special education need and disability provision in derbyshire affect thousand of vulnerable child or try to deal with the terrible county finance which it be try to plug by close much love care home again leave some very vulnerable people with an uncertain future where be he he be march with wealthy landowner down here in london ask the shadow minister what she think first attract various multimillionaire in various industry to suddenly discover passion for farming and buy farm in their late middle age have think that the conservatives would want to discuss the huge challenge face our nhs the cost of living crisis affect so many of my constituent or their fail track record in deliver vital regional infrastructure but no we have have silence on those issue what have get they out literally march on the street be rush to defend multimillionaire my constituent can see what be the no priority and it be not the same as theirs let we be clear retain the status quo for which the conservatives be argue would see of claimant receive of the relief that be million give to just estate why should of the rich get million in tax relief and not ordinary family one would have think that after such profound rejection of their party record in government back in july the conservatives would have take some time to listen to the electorate and learn the electorate see that this labour party be different and vote we in perhaps the conservatives should take close look and here include the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart many of my colleague be deeply rooted in their rural community and myself come from family of farmer in fact spend most of my family sunday lunch listen to an in depth monologue on sfi technical detail which be of course very welcome while the conservatives be rush to defend the wealthy in society we in labour will be focus on what matter to rural community access to rural health facility record billion for farmer new commissioner for tenant farmer which be fantastic new rural crime strategy and protect farmer from bad trade deal come from family of farmer know wolf in sheep clothing when see one however much the conservatives bleat about stand up for farmer their bushy tail and terrible record for farm over the past year tell otherwise will always fight for farmer to improve farming income and to support farming community that be my priority and it be the priority of this government must begin by draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests rise to support the land base and agrifood sector in my constituency sector that stand bewildered at what this government be do to it government who it think have its back and that be go for growth farmer constituent write to shortly after the budget say all these change have mean that our already tight margin be non existent the next few month be go to be spend calculate if it would be well to just sell up and no long farm that be hardly surprising give that the average salary of farmer in this country be little over although farmer be describe by many as be multimillionaire my constituent disappointment be heighten by the government assurance before the election and the specific promise that they make on apr and bpr think that if may say so without damn his career too much see that he be no long in the chamber the hon member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours do we service by remind we of that promise however we should not be surprised my hon friend the member for north norfolk steff aquarone and the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart have already draw attention to john mcternan who very helpfully allow the mask to slip when refer to farmer he say that we should do to they what margaret thatcher do to the miner he go on to say that farming be an industry we can do without we do need small farmer hope that when the minister wind up the debate he will do we service by distance himself completely from those sentiment the government estimate of in scope farmer be either incompetent or tricksy and duplicitous set aside ministers apparent confusion over what constitute an acre and what constitute hectare we be of course indebted to the central association of agricultural valuers which say that farm over single generation will be affect five time the government estimate think the minister should reflect on that because there be no shame in admit that the government and their official have get this wrong there be time to fix it and there be time to look at such independent source to compare and contrast their datum with the datum that the government official have produce and to tack accordingly be the minister to do so appreciate the treasury pressure that he be under his stock among the farming community would rise substantially in these early few month of his tenure have helpful suggestion the government have pick the wrong target think that many member of this house would be perfectly happy for this government or any government to target those who have over year use land to avoid inheritance tax particularly institutional investor hedge fund manager and oversea investor who have artificially put up the price of land in this country which force new entrant out of the market and distort it that be perfectly legitimate thing for any government to do but what this government be do be pick on small and medium sized farm many of which have be in family for generation the government be do the productive sector of our land economy in this country massive disservice and frankly be act in way that be unfair and unworthy implore the minister who know be good man to think again he should talk to the treasury and turn his fire on individual and institution use land to avoid tax which force up land price hand off our family farm bassetlaw have heritage and future in energy production with coalmining and power station once dominate the skyline the workforce and our community although its focus be now shift towards bring world lead fusion energy production to the area we also have proud tradition of food production with farm and rural community cover over half of my constituency the farmer in bassetlaw be deep rooted and proud part of our history it be essential that meet local farmer both before and after be elect in july so that could understand their priority and represent their interest follow my election immediately join the nfu scheme and look forward to visit chicken pack centre at the end of this week want to know at first hand the difficulty the conflict and the change that our farmer be make to meet today challenging need expectation and market force in bassetlaw we have mix of mainly arable farm with some farm combine livestock and arable and small number that focus solely on livestock in recent time they have have to deal with the impact of storms babet and henk with water sit in field for month which have turn they into pond bottom and impact on production plan and opportunity over the last year hike in the cost of live and rise in the price of fuel seed and grain have all have impact get people to work on our farm have prove to be perennial problem which have be make much more difficult in recent year because apprenticeship opportunity remain unfilled and find reliable crop picker be become as rare as hen tooth rural crime be huge issue fly tipping and the theft of livestock and equipment be daily threat that interrupt people work life and impact on production and profit the tories brexit deal ignore the need of farmer we have all see the queuing at the port with rot fruit and vegetable and an inability to safely transport livestock the last government trade deal have allow cheap food to be import due to the low farming standard in overseas nation welcome the billion commitment to british farmer in the recent budget the large ever financial commitment in farming history it will be direct at sustainable food production so that we eat more british produce food there will be an additional million to support farmer affect by the storm last winter alongside the new flood resilience taskforce that will work to protect farmer field from the extreme of the weather and on top of this the government have commit million to rebuild the armoury against disease threat that impact so greatly on the farming industry for the first time ever there will be cross government rural crime strategy focus on crack down on the criminal who blight our countryside want to live in country that put pride into buy british food my challenge be that we lead that campaign in our advertising our supermarket our restaurant and cafe our high street and our market align the union jack with the food we eat be the key to strengthen our commitment to buy british whether it be on our menu or on the shop counter choose british must become the first and good choice we need to adapt to once again buy and eat seasonal food that be way of life and be something that we should be proud to return to forget convenience and buy british that be why welcome the government use their purchasing power across the public sector some of the food eat in hospital prison school and army basis will now have to be locally produce this government will protect farmer from be undercut by the low welfare standard and poor standard in trade deal be proud to sit on the bill committee that be steer through new veterinary agreement with the eu to get our live food export into overseas market be proud of my country and be proud of the farmer in bassetlaw will continue to listen to their concern and be speak to defra and treasury ministers about those concern their voice be my voice commend my near neighbour the hon member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours on his brave contribution it be hard to come to this chamber and tell the truth when the pressure from the whips and the party be to defend the government at all cost he make it absolutely clear that this measure will have devastating effect on farm and the farming industry in his constituency if it go through as currently set out the hon gentleman constituency and mine have something in common in that in the foot and mouth outbreak which devastate the farming industry we see for sure how important farming be to the whole community because farming be shut down business be shut down shop be shut and lot of business include garage and all the service in rural area could not function because farming be not function that show the great importance that farming have ironically however the outcome for my constituency of this measure from labour government will be the further acquisition of land by private equity company this be because thank partly to the scottish government lifting of restriction on land that can be afforest good farming land in my constituency be under huge pressure from private equity fund buy it up to plant tree for carbon capture relief it often seem that it be great thing to plant tree and that we should all be in favour of it but the reality be that these tree be sitka spruce tree that be plant very close together there be no light or environmental content within these forest area no creature can survive in they they be not environmentally friendly or sustainable but they be financially attractive they employ nobody there be no employment once the forest have be plant when farmer come under pressure as they will to sell land to meet the inheritance tax this be who the buyer will be it will be these private equity firm and if it be not they it will in many instance be those who want to develop solar panel in farming scenario as other member have highlight do the right hon gentleman agree that even the most ambitious estimate show we could cover only of agricultural land with solar farm do he agree with tom bradshaw the nfu president who tell journalist day ago what do want to say be that an individual solar farm be not something which risk national food security and do he agree with the cla which say in solar be also valuable diversification and cost reduce land use for farm help to shield exposure to volatile agricultural market no do not agree with the hon gentleman proposition do not think that viable prime agricultural land should be use for solar farm believe there be plenty of other brownfield land or land that be not prime agricultural land that could be use for solar farm be therefore not supportive of some of the huge development propose for my constituency will now touch on one or two other point that have be raise but not expand on first lot of this discussion have be as if the sole structure of family farm be mother father son and daughter brother and sister or cousin be often involve in the farming business and it be quite wrong to suggest that some of the relief that can be apply would work in that situation have constituent who be in exactly that situation family farm be not just mum dad son and daughter it be brother sister cousin and extended family the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael touch on tenant farmer tenant farmer in scotland in particular be in very difficult position because they can not sell couple of field to pay their inheritance tax they will have to give up the whole of their business if they can not find the money in other way to pay these bill we need to understand the issue that face tenant farmer also commend the right hon gentleman suggestion that there should be much wide debate about farming finance the way to secure farming finance and to secure our farmer be not to destroy the family farm be quite astonished because as we sit in pub car park in the run up to the general election farmer in my constituency tell kid you not that they know they do well under labour government but they often vote conservative it feel like the conservatives have take their loyalty for grant the right hon gentleman have be talk about how hard thing be and agree with he farmer talk about their margin and those margin be tight but who cause they to be in that situation we be now in position of power order remind member that intervention need to be intervention they should be brief and ask question that be relevant to the speech be make do not know whether the hon member for south derbyshire samantha niblett be here for the speech of the hon member for penrith and solway but he set out exactly what happen to he as labour mp have give farmer assurance about what labour would do in government and the farmer find that they have be betray now the choice be not final as he say and hopefully this debate have show the passion of both farmer and those who represent rural constituency be glad that the right hon gentleman enjoy my speech do he enjoy the bit at the end where list the abject failure of his government like the honesty of the hon gentleman speech in set out how the labour government have let down his voter by go back on their undertaking in relation to the policy they should listen to what have be say in today debate to farmer and to the hon gentleman and they should change the policy as someone who live on farm which be surround by farm and whose family have farm and diversify for generation add my voice to all those who have pay tribute to farmer for the crucial role they play in our economy many other hon member have say it more eloquently than can but let we all recognise the vital role of farm in our economy in common with colleague meet with farmer in the post budget period frankly be expect pretty hard time and there be some robust discussion but they be also civil constructive informative and understanding pay tribute to the farmer and the nfu representative who take that approach to the discussion what most surprise be how quickly the discussion immediately pivot to the sense of anger abandonment and betrayal that arise from the past year which have decimate the industry fellow member have describe in detail the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron describe the situation particularly well the betrayal of brexit the spiral energy and feed price the spiral land cost and the terrible trade deal that open the door to poor quality import which undermine the very farming market that conservative member claim to value as we have hear already that dire management result in over farm and agribusinesse go out of business since that be terrible shocking shameful legacy for conservative members to now present themselves as the champion of farmer be outrageous they have use the word arrogance but that be what they have display refusal to reference understand or learn from their own history and failing conservative members talk about be friend of the farmer but for the past year they be not it show how little they care that only of their parliamentary party be present for debate that they have only out of conservative members it be amazing one of my colleague talk about the green field opposite in reference to the empty conservative benches give that background it be no surprise that farmer be angry worried and feel vulnerable associate myself with the remark make by the hon member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour who call for calm and sense in the debate emotive language design to sow fear and cause concern be irresponsible at the very least so let we try to keep to the fact and keep thing calm and reasonable the focus of conservative members seem to be family farm but the phrase family farm tax immediately create sense of fear and targeting which be completely wrong with some sensible tax planning million of asset can be exempt many speech have glance over the importance of gift right let we take the scenario of family farm in its true sense that be to be pass between generation surely gift right be massive opportunity to avoid all inheritance tax and remove the sense of fear that conservative members be try to create most of the rest of the country have to do that simple estate planning by default as the hon gentleman will be aware reservation of benefit apply when an asset that be still be use be pass on under the seven year rule be he suggest that farmer who have be on their farm for their whole life should move out of their farmhouse get off the land and pay market rate rent where will they get that money from give that as we know farm profit be so small range of relief benefit and right create an ability in most case to avoid tax let we take the seven year rule it be tapered rule so after four year the liability drop from to also this have not be mention much today inheritance tax insurance be available particularly for young farmer who wish to gift those asset to the next generation inheritance tax insurance effectively mitigate any risk of death inside seven year recognise that for old farmer that can become quite expensive none the less it be mitigation that be open to anybody recognise the issue of gift with reservation but that be my central point it be not just say this the institute for fiscal studies have say that with sensible realistic and relatively straightforward estate planning estate worth considerably more than million will remain exempt from tax there be many measure that can be take however in this context one of the great benefit of have detailed discussion with farmer be the ability to recognise the practicality and the detail by talk to becki who run multi generational farm in darwen come to recognise that there be very good argument for degree of flexibility around gift right and timescale for the it be perfectly good argument for the provision of professional and detailed tax advice to allow genuine family farm to take full advantage of all the relief that be available genuinely believe that well advise true family farm can with plan to pass those farm between the generation mitigate or completely avoid any liability from these taxis will finish by go back to the main point that member have make farm do not make enough money turn thing around get back to we need to get back to situation where farm can succeed as business and where we bring cost down not just raise price as be suggest we need to bring energy cost down and make bill be more stable use the government purchase power to buy locally produce food protect farmer from be undercut through bad trade deal and remove risk through rural crime strategy and the flood resilience taskforce our plan for farm be support by billion which be the big investment in farm in generation let we stop the scaremongering get behind british farming and reverse year of decline staffordshire be the large dairy produce county in the midland and across the county we have people work on farm four hundred and thirty two of those farm be in my constituency and they be an incredibly important part of the fabric of the area so many of my constituent who listen to the budget be genuinely shocked they be shock because they take it at face value when the labour party say that there would not be any change in inheritance tax for agricultural land they listen and they believe know always like to believe the very good of people that the ministers on the front bench from the department for environment food and rural affairs would have fight for that position but this policy be diktat from the treasury in my experience there be tendency for the treasury to do that to many departments that diktat have mean change in position and one that have severe impact on many people life if there be factory in staffordshire employ people and its future viability be in jeopardy ministers would be rally to its support member across the house would be say let we do something to save these job and save these livelihood but that be not the case here will the right hon member give way will of course give the hon gentleman the opportunity to burnish his potential to be that parliamentary private secretary in defra that know he be so desperate for on any occasion why be the right hon member so dismissive of defra which be fine department whose work those of we who believe in the countryside value wonder why he be not so loud when agribusinesse in his region close in the last year all the while have be member of parliament have fight for my farmer and will continue to do so invite the minister for food security and rural affairs to the next staffordshire agricultural show as my guest will happily take he around and he can look for farmer who be in favour of the government policy he can talk to my farmer there be farmer in the stafford constituency which neighbour my own who imagine will have very similar view to that of farmer in my constituency that this policy will put they out of business if take the minister around the staffordshire agricultural show he might meet some of the farmer from the neighbour lichfield constituency let he see how many of they believe that his policy will help they to grow their business family business whether it be farm or manufacturing business invest not just for five year but for generation and more the government policy will drive large financial institution to own much more of our land not local farmer who be invest in the community and care about the village and town that serve they this policy be already have an impact many business that supply farmer be already see significant drop off in order whether it be people who supply agricultural machinery people who supply seed or many more urge the minister who believe come to this house with good heart to look at the wide impact that the policy will have on our countryside and at how it can be change and improve the labour party say that it want to capture the large landowner the james dysons have great deal of confidence that such people will be able to find different arrangement that mean that their wealth will never be touch but many small farmer who have work hard all their life to build something that they can hand on to their child will be impact fear for they and urge the government to put the dogma of party politic to one side and really think of the impact that the policy will have on the life of so many farmer who be try to do the right thing for this country and our countryside thank the farmer who visit in the house for the good and respectful conversation that we have reflect their concern to ministers and will continue to do so the conservative government trash our economy mortgage rate go up interest rate go up price go up and taxis on work people include farm worker go up the conservative party smash public service with unprecedented and often unnecessary cut to the service that our country rely on include farmer our road pothole gp surgery under resource lack of mental health provision school struggle sometimes crumble housing unaffordable especially in rural area could go on the conservatives dash the hope of farmer when they be in government they try to sell out farmer with their trade deal often gleeful about cheap import or hint at support for chemically treat or hormone inject meat they give farmer the chaos of delayed stop start support scheme cut to the police include rural policing neglect of flooding in rural area and the incompetence of not even manage to spend million that they have not manage to cut now the conservatives speak perhaps exaggeratedly about the impact of this government plan where be their outrage when farmer and agribusiness be force out of business from onwards or when service be be cut by their government they be unabashed in their defence of the status quo on inheritance tax which mean that they be content to see the top of the wealthy claimant account for of the total value of apr cost the taxpayer million they be unashamed in their overall position on budget that as result of the tough decision take by my right hon friend the chancellor have provide billion to the farming budget over two year the large ever budget for sustainable food production million for farmer affect by last winter wet weather and million to protect against future disease contrary to some recent campaigning labour be invest in british farming equally the government budget be invest in our entire nation in our economy and our public service and we will build the growth and prosperity that we all rely on we have make our decision now opposition members especially conservative members must justify why they continue to support the status quo why they oppose our budget with its funding for farming and why they rail against our budget investment in the economy if they oppose this they owe it to people outside this house to say which taxis they would increase which public service they would cut and how much they would increase borrow by when the hon member consider how much money will be raise by the family farm tax how many hundredth of percent be it against total annual government spending the hon member will not be surprised to hear that do not have that precise detail to hand to those who trash our economy who smash our public service who dash the hope of farmer over year who be unabashed in their defence of the status quo and who refuse to set out credible alternative to our budget say we will decline their advice today urge hon member across the house to do the same it be privilege to contribute to the debate represent salisbury and south wiltshire which have large number of farmer large number of they visit here in the house of commons and week later have the large meeting of farmer have ever have in salisbury they be gravely disappointed and concerned about the implication of this budget measure it be shock because it be widely expect that this measure would not be on the table when the labour government come in one of the great privilege of my career be to spend most of the past eight year six and half of they in the treasury in various role be pps to chancellor philip hammond and then be economic secretary and chief secretary understand the dynamic between spend departments and the treasury in the run up to budget and have serious degree of sympathy for the ministers who be in defra in the run up to this budget but when apr and bpr be put on the table in front of and my ministerial colleague at numerous point during our time in the treasury we say no acknowledge be try to be as reason and as reasonable as can that other choice would have have to be make and recognise the difficulty of those choice we face difficulty when we come into government in with deficit this government have different set of challenge although would dispute some of the number however want to keep my remark focus on the measure at hand the reason would never have want to progress the removal of apr and bpr be that that policy be the product of technical desktop economist view of tax raising it be not an option when one take into account the reality of what would actually happen to the rural economy and the implication for farming number of colleague have rehearse excellent example where farm of quite modest size but serious capital value would be massively compromise by that policy even with an opportunity to repay that inheritance tax interest free over year as the chancellor say to the select committee acknowledge that it be standard practice for this sort of relief but give the profitability of the typical farm it be just not realistic prospect have have some dealing in the past with the farming minister the hon member for cambridge daniel zeichner and genuinely have great deal of respect for he do not want to embarrass he by say anything more he have large number of issue to deal with and think all of we in this house want to see some clarity around the land use framework and how we reconcile the question of where we build more home with the challenge of renewable energy however we have to keep in focus the core function of our farmer which be to produce food recognise the point make in an intervention early and be not suggest that the government be go to say we be go to have solar farm everywhere but we do need to have coherent farming policy as whole and land use strategy that people understand the issue with this policy be that it be go to decimate the number of family farm unless there be significant increase in threshold there be an age limit on when the policy apply or an alternative tax mechanism like business asset roll over relief be examine by the treasury unless those change happen and there be time to consider those change before the legislation come before this house which will probably be at the end of next year we in this country be go to be in real trouble with the legacy of this decision urge the minister colleague in the treasury to think again and come back with well proposal for their colleague come here today to speak up for upland farmer in my constituency although be not farmer myself grow up within smelling distance of dairy farm and come from work background have earn living work outdoors in all weather as gardener so know what it feel like to have mud on my boot and frozen finger for lot of our farmer though the physical strain be only part of the daily struggle the other part be the anxiety of have so much invest in such precarious business and the burden of responsibility for keep the farm alive in an era of shrink profit because farmer be work people who deserve secure livelihood and because food security be essential for our national security hold quarterly forum with the farmer in my area say that before anyone try to intervene to ask how many meet with hold regular forum and in fact some of our council candidate be local sheep and cattle farmer of course have meet with they more in the last few week than have be do in the meantime be have conversation with fellow mp and with defra and treasury official and ministers to push for the issue that matter to farmer in our area as such when go to the bill office last night to receive the motion for today debate be genuinely unsure how would vote read it with an open mind but when see it think what load of tripe by the way thank the right hon member for salisbury john glen for take much more constructive tone in his speech moment ago the opposition could have come to the chamber today and present constructive motion that many rural mp on the government back benches would have sympathise with instead this motion seem calibrate to make we want to oppose it it seem to that the opposition be more interested in play party politic and cosplaying as the friend of farmer with this motion than they be in genuinely address issue that they both ignore in government and be now ignore in opposition some legitimate concern about the policy have be express to by farmer in my constituency by the way many farmer in my constituency sympathise with its aim and with what the government be try to achieve one tell recently that he can not stand the james dysons of this world who be hoover up agricultural land however they be concerned that there remain tax incentive to invest in agricultural land and would be grateful if the treasury report on some of that modelling for example we know that of wealthy claimant account for of the cost of apr but that mean that be cost only million it would be interesting to know how much money it would cost to slightly lift the threshold or to address the concern about life insurance rise will not take any intervention but only because other colleague want to get in there be concern but must say that when meet farmer in my constituency recently they agree with that big concern for they as many colleague have say be profitability the motion could have talk about economic stability for low inflation and interest rate and it could have talk about cut rural crime which would also cut insurance premium if may say so welcome the equipment theft prevention act from the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith but there need to be secondary legislation agree thank you let we work together be pleased that the government be defend against flood and disease be pleased that we be committed to protect standard in trade deal be pleased that we be committed to get veterinary agreement with the eu to cut red tape be pleased with the public sector procurement target however we need to do something on rule about food labelling in order to prevent farmwashing we also need to do more to strengthen farmer bargaining power with supermarket be pleased with the change to plan law that will allow lot of farmer to invest would just say to my own party and to the government that we need to bring these forward fast farm in my constituency be on life support there be in fact good will towards this government and what we be try to do but we can not afford to wait another month particularly for the basic payment scheme transition we need upland farmer to be able to access the sustainable farming incentive know the sfi be in the pipeline but they can not wait month to receive they rise order member will be aware that be start the wind up at pm precisely for the last few minute call lewis cocking thank you madam deputy speaker broxbourne be not know for its farm but this year boundary change have see my agricultural land increase this tax will also affect thousand of my constituent through the supply chain and buy food at supermarket however want to concentrate on something we keep hear from labour members we be tell that the farmer represent by opposition mp or conservative mp be completely against the policy and we be tell time and again by labour members as number have stand up to say today that they have speak to their farmer who seem happy about it and they be go to vote with the government so think would go out there and put that to the test as have say my seat have have boundary change and farm have move into my constituency if this one farm have remain in the original seat before the general election it would now be represent by labour member but it be not it move into my constituency and it be represent by conservative member ask this farmer when go to visit they if they be completely against this policy they say yep absolutely lewis this will destroy our family farm ask they if pre boundary change they be in their old seat and have labour member of parliament their view would still be the same they say to do be so silly lewis of course it would be the same so do not understand which farmer labour members be speak to because their view can not be different from the view of my farmer thousand of they from across the country include my constituency and the wide hertfordshire area come to westminster to show their displeasure with the government so will labour member please think again vote with we today and stand up for their farmer call the shadow minister this morning ordinary farming family across all four corner of our united kingdom will be wake up to another day of hard graft if it be anything like my upbringing the kid will be out early help their parent feed the livestock dad might be milk the cow or perhaps out crop walk with the agronomist rightly concerned about the impact of recent wet weather and mum will no doubt be battle the element keep the whole operation run smoothly and somehow still find time to make sure everyone have their wellie on the right foot anyone with experience of rural life understand all too well the constant struggle of keep family farm afloat it be tough work long hour barely any room to breathe and financial struggle for many as have say many time in this house our farming family be not multimillionaire many will be strive to make profit but lot of our family will not be with many of our farmer earn less than the minimum wage but today these farmer will also be wake up with the crush reality that they now face lose everything they have ever work for everything that their mum or dad or the generation before they work for all because of this labour government disastrous farm tax have speak to hundred of farmer in the day since the budget as have the shadow secretary of state and many colleague sit behind and we have learn that labour catastrophic budget really be an anxiety that very few farmer be ready for we have hear about many of their concern in the debate my hon friend the member for weald of kent katie lam speak about those such as ross in her constituency who may have ill health and other challenging circumstance who do not have time to plan my right hon friend the member for braintree mr cleverly talk about farming accountant raise incredibly distressing call from farmer my hon friend the member for bridlington and the wolds charlie dewhirst and my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson raise the impact on the wide rural economy and the whole of the uk production sector my hon friend the member for north cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown and my right hon friend the member for south west wiltshire dr murrison rightly mention the challenge the whole budget will have on our farming include the dire consequence of employer national insurance my hon friend the member for mid norfolk george freeman and for broxbourne lewis cocking rightly highlight the concern of family farm that will have be in the family for many generation face be split up my hon friend the member for gordon and buchan harriet cross and my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen rightly challenge the government own datum and figure and lack of understanding of value but the core issue be that this be all about trust before the general election labour look our farmer in the eye and tell they continually that there would be no change to inheritance tax indeed the hon member for high peak jon pearce even at husting before the general election classify this as conservative scaremongering and many labour mp now sit opposite proudly stand with placard say they would back british farming yet here we be day after labour introduce the family farm tax and day after thousand of family farmer rally in london and there be not shred of contrition from the ministers sit opposite not even the slight bit of empathy for those ordinary farming family who know the value of their business and who have look at the detail and have be hit hard by labour family farm tax and that be because their level of arrogance be stark as we have see in this debate the hon member for ribble valley maya ellis for peterborough andrew pakes and for forest of dean matt bishop could not even mention one farmer in their constituency who support this policy the hon member for north east derbyshire louise jones seem to be convince that this will impact only the wealthy the hon member for hexham joe morris who believe be not in his place and the hon member for north northumberland david smith both say they have engage with their farmer and hear their view but then fail to mention anything in support of scrap labour disastrous family farm tax no wonder their farmer be up in arm the hon member for bassetlaw jo white turn up but fail to mention anything about inheritance tax relief and the hon member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours rightly highlight labour break promise pay tribute to he for mention it but will he have the courage to commit to back our farmer and to vote with we for scrap labour family farm tax the hon member for rugby john slinger speak make no reference at all to inheritance tax but do mention the budget can tell he that after the budget in one single week end november company file to shut down also point out that we see million more business between and the nfu the cla the tfa and farming organisation up and down the uk say that labour budget will tear apart british farming uk food production and our domestic food security agenda the central association of agricultural valuers whose member job it be to determine the value of farm say that the government have get their figure completely wrong those very same tax expert who the farming minister roll out in defence of this policy just few week ago have now go on to criticise it the government be look incredibly isolated public support for this policy have be wipe out since it be announce leave labour mps as its only defender up to now they have all fail to publicly call out our city dwell prime minister and chancellor callous budget now we have even have the exchequer secretary the hon member for ealing north james murray be wheel out to open this debate as the government last remain hope to try to defend this disastrous attack on our farming family the government have lose the expert they have lose the industry and it now seem they have lose their own secretary of state from the front bench it be great to see that he have just walk into this debate and turn up and it be weak and embarrassing the shadow minister say that labour member do not know any farmer do be proudly sixth generation farmer daughter my brother still farm but for how much long do not know my dad die exactly year ago today my mum be partner in the business and she be now my brother be not married and he live in rather lovely farmhouse but we do not know for how much long that will be he be worried about his farm he be worried that he will be the one to close the gate for the very last time do the shadow minister agree that we must move to compromise transition and clawback mechanism let we look to incentivise our farmer rather than this punitive tax the hon member highlight the devastating consequence that labour budget will have on our family farm many question remain unanswered so with the opportunity of treasury and defra ministers sit side by side will put few to they first if this be unified government why do the treasury tell defra about this policy only the night before the budget secondly why do ministers not take into account claimant of bpr in the limited dataset they have release be happy to give way to the farming minister if he want to answer that specific point because he have not answer it to date thirdly why do the government believe it unnecessary to take into account the size of family farming business when determine the impact of their million cap on agricultural property relief and business property relief finally for the sixth time of ask in this place why have no detailed economic impact assessment for this policy ever be produce our position be clear we back our british farmer and the conservative party will reverse this family farm tax that be exactly why we will force this vote today but we can not do it alone therefore conclude by reach out to labour mp across the chamber know there be some sit behind the front bench who have first hand experience of rural life who understand the consequence of this family farm tax and who be say in private that the government have get this terribly wrong say to those member that it be not too late to save our farming family from this cruel farm tax and from those faceless multinational corporation that will no doubt sweep up any land that be force to be sell as result of this policy it be not too late to join our british farmer many farming organisation across the uk and the ten of thousand of farmer who be in whitehall just few week ago many labour members commit to back british farming before they enter this place and now be their chance to prove it british farmer be watch and labour mp have clear choice either to back british farming and scrap this catastrophic tax or to put party politic before the voice of their constituent and farmer urge everyone in the house to do the right thing to put british farmer first and vote against labour family farm tax be grateful for the opportunity to close this debate on the plan reform to agricultural property relief it have be important to hear from people on all side of the debate and to outline the step that the government have take to reach the decision on agricultural property relief the reform to apr be just one of the tough decision that the government have to take across the board on tax welfare and spending to plug that billion black hole that we inherit from the conservatives and restore our public service we have have many contribution to the debate be sorry that can not respond in detail to all of they on my side we start with an excellent account from my hon friend the member for ribble valley maya ellis my near neighbour my hon friend the member for peterborough andrew pakes speak eloquently about the workforce issue it be astonish how rarely they be raise from the conservative benches although there be some noble exception we hear from my hon friend the member for forest of dean matt bishop and from my hon friend the member for high peak jon pearce who along with number of other rightly raise issue of profitability in the sector my hon friend the member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours make the important point that we be not discuss the finance bill today my hon friend the member for hexham joe morris ask why it take labour member to raise rural crime issue because anyone who have be out talk to farmer will know that that be their top concern from my hon friend the member for north northumberland david smith we hear powerful account of the value of rural life my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire louise jones again talk about the national health service these be the concern of people in rural area from my hon friend the member for bassetlaw jo white we hear about rural crime again we hear from my hon friend the member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae and from my hon friend the member for rugby john slinger who rightly outline the conservatives atrocious record over year on public service finally my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth rightly dismiss the opposition motion as load of tripe although perhaps that be tough on tripe huge range of figure and analysis have be quote in the debate so far have to say that part of the problem with those figure be that they seem to be about different thing only one set of figure actually give guidance on this issue and that be the treasury figure show that about estate year will be affect that be base on the hard datum of the actual claim it include the impact of apr but also take into account business property relief urge some opposition members to look at the chancellor letter to the chair of the treasury committee which outline all the detail take into account those personal circumstance the nil rat inheritance allowance and the other capital allowance it be available to all member those figure of course be endorse by the independent office for budget responsibility rise rise opposition members have have lot of time to make their point be go to make mine would conservative members have be so interested during the last parliament remember sit on those opposition benches hour after hour on the rare occasion when there be rural debate they have no interest then suddenly now rise no be afraid that the right hon gentleman come in late and if you turn up late you do not get to speak interruption recognise the frustration and anxiety be feel by farmer around the country interruption order be sure that hon member want to listen to the minister know that my constituent certainly do and farmer across the country certainly will thank you madam deputy speaker be not sure that conservative members do want to listen really as result of the anxiety that we know people be feel it be right that the prime minister the environment secretary and have all meet with the nfu president tom bradshaw to talk about the propose reform the government have and will continue to engage with the nfu the cla the tenant farmers association and other stakeholder the reform will not be introduce until april so there be plenty of time for people to plan for change and to get as they always should when run major business professional advice about succession planning let we be honest last month protest be not just about apr rural community have feel ignore and let down by this place after decade of failure the conservatives sell out british farmer in trade deal with new zealand and australia listen to the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins do we get any apology for the trade deal not word no contrition they have learn nothing they leave farmer face spiral energy bill because they refuse to invest in cheap home grow british power decision that send fertiliser and animal feed cost soar the conservatives be so incompetent that they fail to get million earmark for farmer out the door leave farmer out of pocket as the money sit idle in treasury coffer the disastrous kamikaze budget crash britain economy and send interest rate and mortgage skyrocket at massive cost to our farmer and rural community as result of all that public service be break hospital waiting list be at record high school in rural area be crumble if conservative member use they of course and road across country area be cratere with pothole rural community be rightly feel ignore and leave behind this government will not accept that these reform will disincentivise the wealthy from buy up agricultural land to shield their wealth from inheritance tax and they will also raise the money need to fix those public service this be turning point for national renewal the budget also commit

dearden the house divide ayes noes question accordingly negative question put forthwith standing order no that the propose word be there add question agree to the deputy speaker declare the main question as amend to be agree to standing order no resolve that this house thank farmer for their immense contribution to the uk economy and the nation food security welcome the government commitment of billion to the farming budget over the next two year the big budget for sustainable food production and nature recovery in uk history acknowledge that the government be have to make difficult decision to protect farm and farmer in the context of the billion fiscal blackhole leave by the previous government recognise that the government be seek to target agricultural property relief and business property relief to make they fair whilst also fix the public service that everyone rely on and note that under the change announce in the budget around three quarter of claim for agricultural property relief include those that also claim business property relief be expect to not pay more inheritance tax employer national insurance contributions beg to move that this house regret that increase the rate of employer national insurance contribution nic to and reduce the per employee threshold at which employer become liable to pay nic on employee earning to will lead to increase cost for business and low wage for employee include in particular young people will force company to cut employment lead to some job loss accord to bloomberg economics will increase cost for retailer by billion accord to the british retail consortium lead to high price for consumer will create an annual additional bill of billion for charitable service provider accord to the national council for voluntary organisations so they will struggle to maintain support for vulnerable people and will increase childcare cost for family far regret that the government have not publish its complete assessment of the effect this policy will have on the public and private sector or indeed any impact assessment and regret also that as result of the government economic policy gdp forecast be down inflation be up and business confidence be down growth be the leitmotiv of the labour party its member chuntere on about it during the run up to the last general election and in their manifesto under the heading kickstart economic growth they say that they would secure the high sustained growth in the they also say and know that you like good joke madam deputy speaker but would ask you to contain yourself that they would forge new partnership with business to boost growth everywhere give what have happen those be fantastical statement read labour manifesto be somewhat like step through the look glass it have something of lewis carroll about it this lot be less the prime minister and the chancellor than the walrus and the carpenter cruelly lead business to their demise for all the fantasy in the manifesto they might just as well have speak of shoe and ship and seal wax of cabbage and king and why the sea be boil hot and whether pig have wing because what happen to growth the office for budget responsibility tell we that the budget will lead to less growth across the forecast period than be the case back in the spring under the last government the office for national statistics tell we in the third quarter gdp datum that the economy grow by seventh of the growth in the united states in the third month of that quarter which be september growth be actually negative that be the record of this government the right hon gentleman talk about the obr figure but he fail to mention that his party mislead the obr to the extent that it have to put the failure in writing give that he be talk about lewis carroll be it not true to say that the figure that the obr be work with be more likely to have be receive from the mad hatter that be an amusing intervention but it be thoroughly inaccurate be afraid the obr do indeed look into the suggestion that there be black hole of billion and what do it conclude it conclude that the fiscal pressure in that year be less than half that amount the obr readily accept that have it have discussion with treasury official about that at the time it may well have reduce the amount still far member from across the house know that it be not unusual for the treasury to manage down in year fiscal pressure as matter of course so the argument have be debunk it be the dead parrot it be push up the daisy it be no more the hon gentleman point be indicative of what this government have do they have talk down the uk economy in turn business confidence have slump in way seldom see in our history with purchasing manager index survey fall through the floor we have see the institute of directors optimism tracker score minus in november one would have to go back to april to find low score than that we also know that at the centre of the budget be the big break promise of all the increase in employer national insurance contribution that be weigh on growth and what of job labour fantastical manifesto talk about job creation which be mention several time but the government be destroy job by break manifesto commitment it be there in black and white in their manifesto that they would not raise national insurance do not take my word that they breach their manifesto take that of paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies who say precisely the same the right hon member refer to broken manifesto pledge the conservatives manifesto say they would not raise national insurance yet three year later he and all his colleague vote to raise national insurance not just on employee but on employer can he help we with that process of logic think the hon gentleman might just be overlook little something call covid which shrink the uk economy by over overnight what this government have do be take we right back to the when it come to the jaw drop level of tax increase and spend splurge the impact on job be stark and it be clear the obr say there will be few full time equivalent job as result of the measure in the budget bloomberg say that job will be destroy the confederation of british industry in survey of its membership say that of business report that they will cut employment as consequence of the budget and two third say that they will row back on the recruitment plan that they previously have it be not just about the headline rate the threshold be so pertinent and important here it be bear down on sector where wage be low and on cohort in the labour market who earn the least because of the disproportionate impact of lower the threshold they include hospitality leisure retail and woman some of the young people in our country will now see their job take away from they as consequence of what this government be do we know that the labour party have form when it come to youth unemployment under the last labour government youth unemployment increase by over under the last conservative government it reduce by over labour say in this fantastical document that it would keep inflation as low as possible it say the same of mortgage and yet what have happen this fiscal splurge this billion each year that the government be now go to be spend will mean high inflation in every single year of the forecast compare with the forecast back in the spring what be that do to people living standard it be destroy they and will come to that momentarily part of the inflationary pressure be the national insurance increase itself because while we know that accord to the office for budget responsibility about of it will be transfer into low employment rate and depressed wage about of it will go into high price and what of living standard this fantastical lewis carroll document say that labour would be make everybody not just the few well off however the joseph rowntree foundation hardly right wing thinktank say that by october the average family will be bad off in real term than they be today we on this side of the house will not take lecture on living standard from the party that leave we with the bad squeeze on wage since napoleon the high energy price in the and the high inflation the conservatives leave we with the worst insulate home and dependent on natural gas that be why this party will invest in insulation to make we all well off in the long run be surprised that the hon gentleman raise the inheritance that his party have receive from the conservatives we have the high rate of growth in the we have bring inflation right down from in october to on target at the time of the general election we have near record level of employment we have near record low level of unemployment we have real wage that have be increase month after month for or month prior to the general election that be not bad inheritance be grateful to the shadow chancellor for give way even if can not quite believe what be hear anyone boast about the economic record of the previous government particularly in the immediate run up to the last election should read this week release from the office for national statistics on the reweighte labour force survey it show that productivity in the year run up to the election fall by that be in just one year that be what economic failure look like no matter what point the hon gentleman may make be afraid he can not get away from the fact that this government be bear down on growth press up on unemployment bear down on employment and bear down on living standard the obr also say that real household disposable income by will be low than it be back in the spring at the time of that forecast we know the impact that national insurance be go to have on wage it will press they down and it will far diminish living standard do my right hon friend the shadow chancellor remember any labour mp in the last general election standing on fully cost manifesto that would mean economic growth be forecast to be low than under the previous government perhaps the hon member for swansea west torsten bell should remember that labour mp stand on manifesto that be apparently fully cost but then have different commitment we have fast rate of growth under the last government than be project under this government the simple fact be that at the time of the general election we have the fast grow economy in the the simple fact be that the labour manifesto say it would deliver precisely that yet we have hear very little about that commitment in recent day and week wonder why do my right hon friend agree that it be important to set the fact right it be important to reflect on the fact that during our year in government despite the financial crisis despite the pandemic and despite the energy crisis more than million job be create and million people be in employment who be not in employment when we take office my right hon friend be absolutely right our record on employment show that we be job create machine after and the statistic he cite be quite right when it come to business this be killer worthy of stand up comedy routine the manifesto say labour will support business through stable policy environment of course we know that all sort of business have be hit by this tax increase include many that directly support our public service our hospice our gps and our pharmacist marie curie have say that it be about to get tax bill for an additional million just think of the impact that will have the question that many be now feverishly and worriedly ask be whether there be more to come be the government go to run out of road with their approach to our economy and will they come back for more well the chancellor recently tell the cbi that the government will not be come back with more borrowing or more taxis yet when the leader of the opposition put this assertion to the prime minister at prime minister question today we hear no answer when twice ask exactly that question of the chancellor yesterday we hear no response currently these business do not know whether the chancellor assertion that there will be no more borrowing and no more taxis be true or false it sound like the shadow chancellor be unconvince by the shrill chant of labour members that the government will fix the foundation of the economy and he have good reason for be suspicious in october when the government have scarcely be in office for three month they have more in month borrowing than any uk government since with the exception of one month during covid do that look like fix the foundation to the shadow chancellor have hear the hon gentleman intervene in various debate and be come to the conclusion that he be probably rather sensible snp member because he be absolutely right interruption do not opine on how sensible his party be just say that he be one of its most sensible member it be very clear that this government will not create firm foundation for the economy they will actually create vulnerable economy because there be risk around the central forecast and downside risk around growth inflation net migration economic inactivity energy price interest rate and so on there will also be risk around the spending envelope after the first couple of year particularly for profligate labour government who may find that constraint unbearable there be also external risk we know that there will be new government in the united states and there be talk of tariff it may be that the deficit financing of tax cut lead to interest rate rise around the world as bond yield increase and that could be import to our shore all these thing mean that we need good level of headroom against our fiscal target yet on the stability target it be quite possible that the headroom have already evaporate why because to my early point the government talk down the uk economy and partly as result be pay more to service the debt that this country carry thank the shadow chancellor for give way my interest be pique by his talk of deficit finance tax cut do he agree with his boss the leader of the opposition that the liz truss mini budget which be the prime example of the thing he criticise be the right package but just with the wrong communication if the hon gentleman have look at the history of that time he will see that be the chair of the treasury committee and have great deal to say about the economic policy that be pursue in the so call mini budget so will leave it at that on that point will my right hon friend give way how could not my right hon friend be give powerful speech do he share my feeling of pity for the in some case distinguished new members of parliament on the government benches they want to talk again and again about the past and about what happen as we recover from the pandemic and get through the energy crisis but not single one want to defend the appalling employer nic increase which will take billion out of the economy but ultimately provide only about billion or billion in revenue for public service it be an extraordinary misstep be it not my right hon friend be right they avoid the present and run away from the future and there be no surprise about why that be the case rise will not give way now for this government support business be like live in world of fantasy in the walrus and the carpenter it be trust oyster who be lead to their early demise with the prime minister and the chancellor it be business that be trust as lewis carroll might have write the final verse business say the chancellor you ve have pleasant run shall we be trot home again but answer come there none and this be scarcely odd because she finish off every one that leave just the conservative party stand up for business in this country for the work man and woman in this country we be the party that understand the difference between fantasy and reality we be the party that know that business need low taxis not high taxis less regulation not more regulation and government who be on their side that be not the labour party the shadow chancellor make number of interesting point and will give he the courtesy of go through number of they he talk about how this government be risk inflation when his government send it spiral to the high level in generation he say that labour members be talk down the economy when his government crash it he say that conservative members disagree with the measure in the budget specifically in relation to national insurance contribution but not one alternative option be lay out in his speech the public have right to know what his choice would be would the conservatives want to increase income tax on worker or vat in the shop or would they like to increase corporation tax again on business would they like to cut ten of billion of pound from public service or borrow more money every single day to pay the bill or continue to make black hole in the public finance he suggest that the labour party transparency with the country about the billion black hole that the conservatives leave be not real but they know that they create it the soon they say sorry to the country the soon the public might start listen to they once again will finish with positive comment the shadow chancellor say that his party be job create machine be very grateful for the number of former conservative mp they have release into the labour market give how many vacancy we have fill in her budget statement on october the chancellor set out the difficult decision that the government need to take on welfare spending and tax those decision be not just difficult but necessary give the fiscal irresponsibility and economic mismanagement of the conservative party over the past year welcome debate on the choice as hear member say from sedentary position choice choice choice what be yours you should set that out to this house and the party opposite should set they out to the public order the chief secretary might like to reflect that when he say what be yours it mean what be mine they be not my choice can he please be careful not to use you and yours thank you madam deputy speaker to be very clear and to correct the record the conservative party should tell the country what its choice be be all ear the labour party inherit mess and we as responsible party of government have need to take measure to fix the public finance fund the national health service and other public service and deliver economic stability we have be determine to take those decision while protect work people which be our manifesto commitment that be why the budget make no change to income tax the rate of vat or the amount of national insurance work people will pay as result of our budget people will not see penny more in tax on their payslip yet keep those promise while get the country back on track mean tough decision elsewhere in the tax system choice and decision that we be willing to take perhaps with the assistance of the exchequer secretary to the treasury behind he the right hon gentleman might be able to answer question that other treasury ministers have not be able to why do the obr make correction in table in chapter it be originally suggest that billion would be provide for compensation to public sector employer and adult social care that be then correct to remove any reference to social care and the number be cut by million can the right hon gentleman explain what cause the obr to make that correction and when it be decide that social care be not worth support the right hon gentleman might in future give advance notice of specific reference to document so that can refer to they can not tell he about table in the obr document because it be not here but we will of course get an answer to he he may wish to consider why the obr say that have the conservative party be more transparent about its time in government its forecast would have be materially different the shadow chancellor be unable to provide an answer to that in response to intervention from colleague from around the house that inheritance be why at the budget we take the decision to increase national insurance contribution for employer while increase protection for small business and charity the government increase the main rate of employer secondary class national insurance contribution from to rise will give way in second we have decrease the secondary threshold for employer which be the threshold above which employer begin to pay employer national insurance contribution on their employee salary from to at the same time we have increase protection for small business by more than double the employment allowance from to the national insurance hike will impact on small business which form the backbone of our local economy as fixture on our high street across london and across my sutton and cheam constituency include in worcester park and north cheam will the right hon gentleman join in recognise that small business saturday be this weekend do he agree that the government might take this opportunity to rethink the national insurance hike and the impact on small business which will be suffer this week and beyond we have factor small business into the design of our policy in term of both employer national insurance contribution and our commitment to permanent low rate for business rate than be give under the previous government as well as other support for the high street we be also expand eligibility to the employment allowance by remove the eligibility threshold to simplify and reform employer nic so that all eligible employer can now benefit change to the employment allowance mean that around employer will see their national insurance contribution liability decrease and more than million will pay the same or less than they do previously overall that mean that more than half of business with nics liability will either see no change or will gain overall from the package that design be put in place specifically to protect the small business that the hon gentleman raise that mean that employer will not pay national insurance at all enable they for example to employ up to four full time worker on the national living wage and pay no employer nic employer will also continue to benefit from employer nic relief include for hire worker age under and apprentice age under to support veteran the government be extend the national insurance contribution relief for employer of qualify veteran for one year to april and we have set aside funding to protect the spending power of the public sector include the national health service from the direct impact of the change even after account for the impact of this change the obr expect real wage to rise by between now and the end of the forecast period but we recognise that there will be impact on employer while many small business and charity will be protect through employment allowance other will have to contribute more there will also be impact beyond business as the office for budget responsibility have acknowledge my right hon friend and spend many year in opposition and have speak in many opposition day debate do he agree that when the opposition move motion like today which say that the government should not do something without make any alternative suggestion about what they should do it be sign that the opposition have not work out their answer to the question at some point hope that the opposition will be able to help the country and the government by have some policy but do he agree that until they do the government will just have to crack on as good they can on their own agree with my hon friend and encourage opposition members to put forward proposal be all ear be willing to listen to they but so far all we have be opposition and no policy maybe that will change in the future the motion claim that the government have not set out any impact assessment of the policy change but the government publish tax information and impact note on november that explain the government assessment of the policy include its impact on business and the economy more widely this be difficult choice and it be not one that we have take lightly but it be the right choice give the dire economic inheritance that the government face upon take office and the need to fix our break public service as the chancellor set out in the budget healthy business depend on healthy nhs and strong economy depend on strong public finance on the nhs and choice do the right hon gentleman not accept that the government have choose to clobber organisation and charity such as air ambulance and the hospice movement the very organisation whose help the government will need to improve service for the general public as we ask yesterday will he consider an exemption as my right hon friend the health secretary have make very clear when the labour party come into government the nhs be break why because of action take by the conservative party over the last year that be why the government have to take decision to get grip of the public finance and our public service the change be necessary in order to draw line under instability so that business can plan for the future and to ensure that the nhs will receive an extra billion to deliver extra elective appointment week that vital new funding will create an nhs that be there when we need it and the government will achieve that within our tough fiscal rule rule that will bring an end to borrow for day to day spending which be completely out of control when the conservative party be in government madam deputy speaker you might think that have call for high nhs spending over the weekend the opposition would recognise the need to take tough but necessary decision on the public finance in order to pay for it but it seem from the speech of the shadow chancellor that that be not the case perhaps the opposition might take the opportunity today to explain how they will raise the billion that the change provide for but which they will not support how else do they intend to pay for the new appointment and well service that the funding offer what tough decision would they make to repair the public finance and put our economy on sustainable footing the opposition double standard on this issue only go to show why they be not trust on the economy they have give up any pretence of fiscal responsibility we recognise that the decision to increase employer national insurance will have impact although the change to employment allowance will help to protect small business and charity other measure mean that large business and organisation will have to make difficult decision however as the chancellor set out this be once in generation budget the difficult decision we take mean that we be able to wipe the slate clean from the previous government economic and fiscal mismanagement public service will now need to live within their mean on the budget we have set for they for the rest of this parliament the budget deliver economic stability and fiscal responsibility so that we can take the step necessary to boost investment fix our public service and grow the economy that fiscal responsibility be only possible when government be willing to take tough decision this government will not shy away from those tough decision and will do what be right to fix the foundation of our economy despite the dire inheritance leave by the conservatives the shadow chancellor say we be hide in the past and not face the future say to he we be run to the future deal with the challenge and deliver for the british people rise order there will be five minute time limit from the outset obviously not include the liberal democrat spokesperson call daisy cooper on october at deputy prime minister question warn the government that an increase in national insurance contribution would impact not only million of small business but social care provider that be week before the budget here we be six week on from that exchange and we be still talk about the impact of those change the reason be that the unintended consequence be huge we all know the government have receive terrible inheritance from the conservatives the conservatives flatline our economy blow hole in the public finance and leave public service on their knee in the wake of the conservative government there be litany of broken promise they promise to recruit gps and they do not they promise to fix social care for good and they do not every single year since they fail to meet their day cancer treatment target have huge sympathy for the fact that the labour government need and want to invest in our nhs and care however be concern about the indiscriminate impact of the change to national insurance contribution hon member ah you ve hear this before come on not only will the change undermine growth they will undermine the effort to get the nhs and care back on their foot over the past six week all of we have hear concern about the impact the change will have on gps dentist pharmacist and social care provider all critical organisation to get the nhs and care service back on their foot we have hear about the impact on the early year sector be concern the change will drive up the cost of childcare when we should be drive it down to help parent get back to work over the past few week have raise example from my constituency of the impact the change will have include on citizens advice which give advice to some of the most vulnerable people hightown housing association provide social home quantum care social care provider rennie grove peace hospice care the bedfordshire and hertfordshire local medical committee represent gps dj play and ye olde fighting cocks the old pub in england we know small business be the engine of our economy and backbone of our community be glad to hear that liberal democrats support the extra money for the health service special need education and social care apologise for my impatience because be sure the hon member be just about to get there but can she tell we where the billion should come from if not from this national insurance rise welcome that intervention in the debate on the national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill yesterday address that question head on will try to remember my note which be sit with hansard the hon gentleman will be aware that the obr have say the billion be actually reduce to billion when behavioural change and rebate to the nhs and care be factor in on raise that billion we have say we would reverse the tax cut that the conservatives give to the big bank raise billion we could raise furth billion by increase the remote gaming duty and the digital service bill we set out proposal in our manifesto to reform capital gain tax in different way from the government our measure would have raise about billion so unlike the conservatives who do not set out the impact of the billion to billion of cut that base on their manifesto would have be inevitable we as constructive opposition have set out suggestion urge labour members to take up our idea if not in this budget then certainly in the next we be approach small business saturday when be sure we will all be in our constituency talk to small business owner we know that small business be the engine of our economy and the backbone of our community and in many case they make our high street what they be when it come to health and care business though be concerned that this measure take with one hand and give back with another but with no guarantee that the money that come back will cover the cost as such urge the government to rethink these change to national insurance contribution but if they do not urge they at the very least to exclude health and care provider from these measure the economic argument in this debate will be well cover by other member so would like to make brief point about choice and political leadership about have argument rather than duck they for decade as low growth place an ever great burden on the public finance conservative members fiddle and fudge choose stealth taxis such as fiscal drag that they hop nobody would notice between and conservative governments introduce tax change they change vehicle excise duty time and alcohol duty time the last parliament see the large set of tax rise since the second world war leave the tax burden at third of national income when government be frightened of their own shadow as well as their own divide back benches it be easy to fudge and fiddle than to face up to hard choice conservative members lack the courage and unity to tackle the great problem this great nation face but not we not this government when we see something fundamental that require courage and leadership to address we square up to it and confront it that be why we immediately undo the fiddle and fudge end the freeze on income tax that have burden work people in this country it be why we end the hidden theft of money from work people and fix the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme and it be why we boost hmrc compliance because there be no point in create tax behemoth that can not be enforce it be also why we make big clear choice to close the gap hole in the public finance leave by conservative members britain economy have run tight labour market alongside stagnant productivity growth for decade in that context national insurance rise be sensible balanced and transparent way to incentivise business investment that will boost productivity while fill the billion black hole that be what courage look like square up to the challenge our country face instead of run scared and leave work people to pay the price we have front up to set this great country back on secure path if the opposition wish to show the nation that they be responsible party ready to govern this great country they must have the courage to tell we whether they would scrap this measure and if not which of the challenge we face they wish to ignore do they want to cut off the electrification of the wigan bolton train line do they want to get rid of the expert work with the wrightington wigan and leigh nhs trust in my constituency to bring down waiting list perhaps they want to cut back once again on the neighbourhood police officer who we be get back on our street or perhaps they want to cut the million investment in border security command do not think so it be pleasure to follow the hon member for makerfield josh simons rise to speak in favour of the motion on the order paper in the name of the leader of the opposition do not rise to speak in this house because think the labour party budget be vindictive but do think that the national insurance rise we be debate today be proposal that run right through the labour party dna labour drive down growth when growth should be the no priority for public service it tax the wealth creator and the small business it borrow and make the economic situation bad and it be always the conservative party that have to pick up the piece after labour have target the poor people and small business in our society and make they suffer ultimately the lack of growth that the labour party and every labour member have sign up to means that public service will suffer few job will be create and more business will close gently say to the chief secretary that he challenge we repeatedly to outline what we would do instead of this measure to make sure that we can fund public service and will tell he few thing that we would not do interruption well will tell he in minute and he can intervene and elaborate and will get an extra minute as he ask what we would do will tell he we would increase growth as be outline by the obr we would have growth and high growth than this government be propose however what we would not be do be borrow as much as he and spend billion on public sector pay rise for his trade union paymaster fund from borrow those be the thing we would not do the hon member tell the house that he would go for growth how do that go when his party try it last time simply say and the chief secretary should know this because he supposedly write the budget that we vote on couple of week ago that growth forecast be high under the last government than those of the government for whom he be now lead in the treasury say to the government that business confidence be at the low it have be for year the hon member have raise the issue of business confidence which have hear few time from opposition members that leave ponder why if business be so confident under the previous government we have the low private sector business investment in the entire and the only country in the oecd that see low level of private investment be greece know the hon gentleman like to pride himself on be the oracle of economics when he lead think tank but if he look at the bare fact of business confidence out there he will see that it have be low under the five month of the labour government than it ever be under the year of the conservative government want to mention some of the impact that this measure will have on my constituency of hamble valley there be people employ in the hospitality sector in my constituency just last night business leader small business leader who own three local venue outline to that because of the measure this government have bring forward he now have to find extra of his total turnover to pay his taxis that lead to number of option he can reduce staff count mean high unemployment in my constituency and nationally he can close venue which again mean low employment and the death of our town centre in every constituency remind member or he have to choose between not hire local staff and stop expansion as every extra person he want to take on will cost the business an extra because of this national insurance contribution rise that choice be face business up and down the country with low growth high bureaucracy and high taxis on the people who create job and wealth in every constituency in this country and drive the economy that we need to fund public service what be most damaging about the government proposal be the catastrophic impact it will have on charity across this country defy any labour mp to stand up in this chamber and say that they be willing to bring in and happy to vote for measure that will mean frontline service deliver through our charitable sector be cut there be other option the government can take and they have choose not to rise be not give way interruption well do not have time let we look at the hospice sector many labour members probably hop that the parachute lead have be cut but raise by jump out of an aeroplane for the mountbatten hospice in my constituency some of its income be from charitable donation and of its income be deliver by the national health service at no time when this minister or any other minister have stand up in this house have they apologise to the hospice sector for the cut in service that will have to be deliver because of this measure mountbatten will have to find an extra million in income just because of this measure and that mean more hospital bed be use by people who be unable to access hospice service ultimately the nhs will be in further crisis because of the short term measure this government be take through will the hon gentleman give way like the hon gentleman so will give way thank the hon gentleman be look at some research the other day that show that parachute jump end up cost the nhs more money because of the risk of injury than they raise for the charity concern do he agree that rather than parachute jump what our nhs need be the billion investment that have be raise by the budget the last government give the high amount of investment into the national health service ever happen to jump out of plane because be very keen to do so as be bit of thrill seeker but also because want to raise money for good charity if the hon gentleman vote for the government measure or against the motion this evening he will be ensure that hospice across this country be unable to deliver the service they want to deliver and as homelessness charity have say that million to million will be take out of frontline service that will be the impact of this measure charity across this country be go to suffer under this government proposal as will hospital and wealth creator and say to every member who vote against this motion to protect frontline service that their constituent will be watch we should not be surprised that five month after take office the labour party have revert to type tax the most vulnerable tax small business and borrow on the public purse with poor public service out there and low growth go forward can not wait for its defeat at the next election and we fix the problem after inherit the ruin of year of conservative failure this government have have to make tough decision to balance the book love the originality and will keep it come until the right hon gentleman get the message after year of work people foot the bill this government be choose to spread the load in as fair way as possible in the spirit of build an economy drive by collaboration between productive worker and thriving business balance have to be strike while we be ask employer to contribute more this do of course come with protection for small business while employer national insurance contribution will increase by this government be choose to protect the small business by increase the employment allowance to and expand this to all eligible employer let we therefore stop the politically expedient outrage and check the real life impact change to the employment allowance mean that the office for budget responsibility expect that employer will gain and an additional will see no change we have also commit to provide support for public sector employer for additional employer cost this also mean that unlike the previous government who give we the high tax burden since the second world war labour be able not to ask for penny more out of worker pay packet while we must listen to the genuine concern from business which like the rest of society be feel the brunt of year of tory austerity and decline be in no doubt that these decision be the right and necessary one that will fix the foundation of our economy and unlock the funding to rebuild our public service my hon friend be talk about fix the foundation and that point be also make by the now absent hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan early in the debate today be budget day in the scottish parliament where of course the scottish government have record amount of funding to spend just want to share with the house what be say about that budget by the fraser of allander institute it say order we simply can not have intervention of that length only nine member be go to get to speak this evening and the hon lady be on the list but those who choose to make long intervention might find themselves remove from it totally agree with my hon friend that this government be support people across the whole country include scotland today and really hope the scottish government use the money they have be give well return to the opposition motion be they also oppose to our country be leave billion black hole by the last government where they also oppose to the disastrous liz truss mini budget which include billion of unfunded tax cut and which shock the market crash the pound and skyrocket mortgage rate be they also oppose to the last government spring budget which include myriad damage unfunded promise in an attempt to flash the cash at the public ahead of an election if they do now oppose all the above they must agree with that we have to restore economic stability by fund our pledge that mean find money and if it be not through this measure would they tax work people or make another black hole we have to face down the reality of these choice for what they be it be overwhelmingly clear that the shadow cabinet who be exile into opposition this summer have not learn single thing they have make billion in unfunded spending commitment in just four week at least we can be grateful that they be not in the position to do more damage at the moment turn to what the fund raise from this measure will do be the opposition oppose to invest an extra billion to fix the foundation of our nhs or cutting waiting time with extra elective appointment week the hon gentleman talk about the nhs what do he have to say to pharmacy which report that his government measure will cost pharmacist million even after take into account the employment allowance say to all member of this house that people have to see these measure in the round this budget will support all our business in the long run be the opposition now oppose to protect the triple lock increase carer allowance freeze fuel duty pay worker properly and support local council be they opposed to boost education funding by billion and hire extra teacher who our child desperately need to secure their future if they be oppose to those thing they be not listen to the british public who in my constituency of stevenage and in hundred of other seat vote at the last election for change from year of conservative chaos change with labour will bring decade of national renewal to fix our public service from the ground up business can only have the confidence to invest in the uk if we bring stability to the economy put money into the pocket of customer and develop thrive public service for the workforce that will in turn improve productivity for business business confidence be demonstrate by the record break billion in investment secure for the uk economy at the international investment summit under labour britain be open for business today the conservative opposition be ask we to pretend that we can grow our economy and rebuild our public service without say how it would all be pay for this tory opposition with their motion today show that they have learn nothing from year of tory fantasy economic the shadow chancellor bring up fantasy economic and his party deliver that for year in government today we have labour government the country vote against fantasy economic in july and today will vote against it too will talk in particular about two organisation in my constituency that have contact about the subject we be debate for context we know that small business have have tough time for number of year they have be struggle with rise price interest rate and input cost go up they be absolutely hammer by the previous conservative government who break their promise to reform business rate trap they under mountain of red tape and make it much hard and more expensive to trade internationally make thing hard for small business and their worker just be not right they be the lifeblood of our economy and be exactly where we should be look for the growth we all need when we be talk about small business we be also talk about community pharmacy hospice and gp practice all of which will be impact by this tax rise we on the liberal democrat benches be particularly worried as the house would imagine about the impact of these tax rise on our health and social care sector we be worried about what it mean for social care provider for the family who depend on they and for the local council that have to find the funding for many of they raise the employment allowance will shield only the very small leave thousand of small organisation still negatively affect in the chief secretary opening remark he ask for idea about where else he might find some tax revenue really encourage he and indeed all government members to reread the lib dem manifesto be sure they have read it at least once as my hon friend the member for st albans daisy cooper lay out from our front bench the government could reverse the tax cut that the previous government give to the big bank reform capital gain tax so that it be apply in much fair way and charge the gambling giant more so that they pay their fair share turn to the two organisation in my constituency childcare company get in touch because like many early year setting it allocate of its revenue to staff wage and annual increase to the national living wage combine with the increase in nic will make it impossible to pay for rent staff improvement and training that will just make the staffing crisis bad which be the exact opposite of what the government say they want do my hon friend agree that business such as sheppy cider farm in my constituency to which invite all member to come to enjoy pint of cider will be affect not just by the national insurance rise but by the change in business rate and the family farm tax thank my hon friend for his intervention sadly have not yet try the ware of sheppy cider farm but would welcome the opportunity to visit try those ware and support it as we all need to do in the face of these change which affect everyone the second organisation be one of my gp practice which email it operate as legal partnership as it have do since the inception of the nhs but as it be gp practice it lack flexibility to absorb the increase cost it can not raise price and it can not do more than it be already do and drive up activity level as it be designate as public authority but do not get an employment allowance exemption it will bear the full cost of the impact it tell that the rise in national insurance and the lowering of the threshold will force it into reduction in clinical staffing adversely impact patient care and increase waiting time that be exactly the opposite of what the government say they want the hon lady make that point powerfully have speak to gp surgery in my constituency that will have to cut seven member of staff include gp nurse social prescriber pharmacist and other provide ancillary service these change will affect not just her constituent and my constituent but every single constituency in the country because every single gp practice will have the same problem completely agree with the hon member point all member across the house want to see our nhs thrive and to see the healthcare and social care that our constituent deserve urge the government to think again about their plan in harpenden and berkhamste we have the elms medical practice which have say it be dedicate to the nhs and want to serve people but be face these difficulty it be ask the government to rethink their choice on national insurance this be about those who want to serve and our constituent who need they very much agree with my hon friend we will all have have constituent and organisation contact we because they be really worried about the impact that these change will have do not think that the government intentionally set out to make life more difficult for gps and do not think that they intentionally set out with their budget to make life more difficult for pharmacy for hospice or for dental practice but we need to speak up for constituent who contact we to say that if the government want to keep the cost of childcare from rise and constituent to be able to access gp appointment in timely manner they need to think again about this rise urge they to do so former conservative leader once have the famous phrase there be no magic money tree sadly that be lesson that opposition members have yet to learn let we be clear about the economic situation that we be face in july when the conservatives leave office the tax burden be at year high and they leave we with billion black hole in our public finance this be their legacy and they must live with it confidence in public service be at an all time low and the tax burden at an all time high they could not even deliver on their promise in my constituency if they have choose to invest the money need into our nhs they would have see the benefit if they have invest the money in our school they would have see the benefit if they have fund our armed service to take on the challenge of tomorrow we would all see the benefit instead when look at the primary care centre in clay cross see hard work health staff let down by the former government when look at killamarsh junior school again see hard work staff and young child let down by this former government as speak to my former army colleague see no improvement in the situation there either thank to the former government we must take action it be our duty as government to take the hard choice necessary believe that in the long run this be positive and necessary step for our uk economy public service and workforce national insurance contribution be the backbone of funding for our essential service such as healthcare and pension and my voter choose that the vale of glamorgan and wales more broadly be full of small and micro business the office for national statistics and the obr have both tell we that most small business and micro business will be well off or the same as before the vale business get not only well public service but good tax set up do my hon friend agree that this be great budget and great proposition for small business in the vale could not agree more have hear from so many small business owner in north east derbyshire who be so thankful for the change that we be make to support they if we fail to make these decision today we risk the prospect of cut to crucial service or an increase burden on future generation which would fall on the most vulnerable in society the hon member talk about cut to vital service do she agree that no one would think less of the government if they be to take billion or billion out of the billion for the nhs and ensure that social care hospice gp surgery and the like do not lose out to have holistic and positive input into the health service rather than the disjoint one that we be at risk of right now be sure that the health team will listen to all and any contribution and will make decision the labour government refuse to balance the book on the back of the poor worker or people strive for well life will the hon member give way be go to make progress as know other back benchers would like to speak instead of austerity mark ii we choose to invest in our service our child and the people who fight every day to keep we safe these increase will strengthen our public service promote economic stability and invest in the future of our workforce they be an investment in our long term prosperity and fully support they the budget force business to compromise on growth those be the word of the ceo of the confederation of british industry the obr have say that the job tax will reduce wage by billion and increase inflation both the obr and the cbi say that it will result in high price so it be no surprise that over the past few week my inbox have be full of local organisation that be gravely concerned about this billion stealth tax we be shocked and they be heartbroken because labour promise not to raise national insurance indeed the then shadow chancellor call it job tax and say that labour would never pursue such thing of the organisation that have write to which be the most worried st barnabas lincolnshire lincolnshire and nottinghamshire air ambulance uppingham gp practice and stamford gp practice the royal college of gps have say that it will cost million appointment to service these increase as well as the vista the royal leicestershire rutland and wycliffe society for the blind local nursery my local citizen advice and my care agency and hospitality business have all write to as we approach small business saturday have my independent shop competition where around vote be cast for the favourite local independent business but those business be write to to tell how worried they be family business be particularly worried the tax will affect rural community most of all because they have small margin they be already worried about farmer go out of business on whom they be reliant and we have small symbiotic community who support one another the hon lady be make an important point about the impact the change will have on small business in she vote for the health and social care levy act have check hansard and she mention none of these concern in that act introduce an increase of percentage point in national insurance for employer and employee this be small rise and it protect employee can the hon lady say why all of sudden she be now concerned when three year ago she be not the hon gentleman may not realise but at that point we be just come out of something call the pandemic and it be health and social care vote so yes absolutely vote to do what we need to do at that point in time it be specific levy to raise specific fund for our health and social care will happily stand behind that vote it be interesting because this tax will make it hard for business to recruit indeed it will cost three time the price at about per employee that be not how to get growth it be how to lose staff as employer let people go how to see increase demand on our welfare budget how to kill off our town centre how to see hospice close and how to see local authority end up reduce service rise no will not give way it will be how charity end up redirect their christmas appeal so that people give the penny they have spare to pay the exchequer rather than to support those who be most desperate those on whom charity should be spend their money this change be the large tax grab of labour budget and it will impact woman and young people most of all yet there be an absence of speech from the government benches about its impact on those who will be most affected employer be the growth maker and they be beg labour to reverse this tax but work people will be those worst affected there be still time for labour to reverse course to listen and to recognise that the ideology it be pursue be go to harm our community it be time for labour to think about the impact and reconsider what it be do particularly to our gp practice and other look forward to hear from the minister when share the letter with he it be not too late labour must reverse course and fundamentally change its way the issue at the crux of the debate be one of economic responsibility it be about choice whether to invest or to let far decline take place in our public service they say week be long time in politic well four month be clearly still not long enough for the conservatives to have learn any lesson from the last general election about why they might be sit on the opposition benches and we might be sit on the government benches they crash the economy waste billion of pound of taxpayer hard earn money and run the nhs into the ground they then call an early election to run away from the mess that they know this government would inherit as legislator we need to be honest with the electorate about the trade off and challenge this country face and we can not simultaneously rebuild our public service and cut taxis at the same time as have be say there be no magic money tree we see with the disastrous liz truss mini budget the impact of government who do not understand those fact recognise there be political difference across the house but the hon gentleman surely have to be concern about the overall impact of the decision on national insurance on the ability and inclination of those who invest in the real economy to generate the wealth and tax revenue that will sustain the economy go forward surely he can recognise that the decision make by his government be have negative effect on growth which will mean more taxis and more borrowing thank the right hon gentleman for that rather long intervention must say that the conservatives do not understand the economy if someone can not get train to work they can not work if they can not get hospital appointment they can not work time and again hear from employer that they want investment stability and for their employee to be able to contribute in the workplace to separate public service and the private sector into two diametrically oppose part of the economy be what the conservatives do for year they cut public service time and again and we all face long term cost because of that fact the labour government understand that sadly the conservative party still do not the choice we be still hear be for continue austerity no one in this country vote for that and no one on the labour benches at least want that we want nhs waiting list to fall we want crumble school rebuild and investment in our vital public service and armed force the hon gentleman and be member of the health committee so ask he this with all seriousness and genuineness do he not see the risk of this tax rise for gp surgery the hospice sector and the voluntary sector which support lot of what the nhs do thank the hon gentleman for that intervention what we have both hear on the health committee be that the nhs have be leave on its knee after year all sector of the health service be cry out for investment hear in my constituency from doctor and nurse who be thankful that finally they be be recognise with decent pay opposition members declare they to be trade union baron no they be nurse doctor teacher and police officer as say we need to invest ministry of defence home in my constituency must be invest in my old primary school deanesfield with its crumble classroom need to be invest in the labour party have plan to make that happen and it be vital that we fund those measure measure that any responsible government would take therefore we do have to make difficult but necessary decision and ask the large business to pay slightly more to help fund those vital public service understand the concern that have be raise but as the minister put forward half of business will not pay the extra contribution and some the small will pay even less will the hon gentleman give way have give way number of time already and want to make some more progress if the right hon gentleman will allow it be bit rich for the conservative party to suddenly discover the charity sector and claim to be the party of the third sector have work in the third sector for year remember nothing but the conservative party slam the charity sector year after year after year the charity meet want we to fix the nhs to fix homelessness and to fix the social and economic problem we inherit from the previous government locally in hillingdon the conservative council have not be champion it have cut they to the bone most of the charity meet have handful of employee leave at well under this government measure they be likely to see support fundamentally in this budget we face choice and we have choose to protect the most vulnerable in society however it appear that the conservative still fail to understand basic economic they want all the benefit of the budget at least they do this week but they do not seem to know how they will pay for they they drive our public service into crisis and now oppose the very measure we be take in the budget to rebuild they nothing have change they be not serious responsible party of government they be still addicted to endless cut to public service pay more and get less constantly take the short term easy approach it would be immensely irresponsible for any government to just ignore the crisis in our public service and to return to austerity instability and decline we choose investment over decline that be what my constituent vote for more doctor more nurse fair pay and investment not decline on that point how can the hon gentleman say we will see more doctor when our gp surgery be tell we that they will have to cut doctor cut staff and cut appointment as result of the national insurance increase what would he say to they would say billion for the nhs record level of investment since the last labour government ask the opposition what would they do would they prefer to let nhs waiting list grow and inequality widen between state and private education would they reverse our investment in neighbourhood policing or our increase funding for social care if not what taxis would they raise instead to pay for those measure they can not continue to have it both way it be clear that the opposition have not learn any lesson their position continue to be found on an economic fiction they be the same old conservative party that crash our economy in and they would do it again well this budget and this government will not we choose investment we choose our nhs and we choose to balance our budget rise order there will now be four minute time limit reminder about intervention member be use up the time that other could have have paul and melissa johnson the director of home instead be local business owner of an adult social care provider base near twyford in my constituency they predict that the national insurance increase will be in the region of year on the basis of their current payroll and that the increase in the minimum wage and other cost will add furth year some similar business may have to scale back their plan for growth or their exist operation or may even face the prospect of close down inevitably that will have significant impact on their elderly client along with the local authority with which they work nationally it be the same story because the government job tax will be the tipping point for thousand of care provider this could have be avoid if the government have instead choose to increase taxis on big bank online gambling company and social medium giant all of which need to pay their fair share of tax the conservatives allow those bank and social medium giant to get off the hook why be labour do the same let ask the minister this will the government commit themselves to exempt social care from the increase in employer national insurance contribution and if not how will they protect those who be affect by the potential closure of social care provider the concern do not end there recently visit twyford surgery and speak to its fantastic gp partner about the impact that the increase will have on their ability to deliver primary care effectively it be the same story that we hear all over the country they be look at in effect reduction in funding which will have an impact on the service they be able to offer include joint injection and contraception the chancellor will compensate the nhs for the cost of the tax increase but that support will not be available to gps or to the vast majority of care provider that be in the private sector which will lead to even great pressure on our health and care service at time when the gp patient ratio for my area be rise with patient for every gp compare with england national average of this be simply unacceptable and it be happen at the bad possible time because general practice be already in crisis patient list be soar and we simply do not have enough gps the government must provide assurance as matter of urgency that general practice will be give the same protection as the rest of the nhs and will receive the necessary funding to cover these additional cost be sure that million of people across the country will agree that it be simply common sense to protect gps at time of crisis will my hon friend give way okay yes thank my hon friend for that reluctant acceptance and congratulate he on his speech do he agree with and with those in lightwater surgery in my constituency that in an average general practice such as lightwater the national insurance rise equate to the salary of fully qualified nurse and that whether by accident or design it will have significant impact on our constituent and their receipt of healthcare my hon friend be right gp surgery have tell that they spend disproportionate amount of time seek out different funding pot which require time and resource time that could be spend on patient care will the minister commit to simplify the process of funding for gps the new intake of youngish use that description carefully member on this side of the house might be forgive for have short memory than other more long suffer member but this be not the first time labour chancellor have make difficult decision on tax to invest in the future of public service particularly our nhs twenty two year ago labour chancellor tell this house that the nhs be in need of reform and modernisation and that investment be need not only to deliver well service but to in the inimitable style of gordon brown define the character of our country official report april vol that decision to raise national insurance contribution combine with far sighted reform deliver the short waiting time and the high public satisfaction with the nhs in our country history now after year of tory government history have repeat itself once again labour government be fix the mess make by the tories and our nhs be face question over its future and quality indeed the choice be more stark today the challenge before we be not simply to improve standard and resource in the nhs but to save the very idea itself back in the tories oppose make difficult decision on tax to support our nhs their then leader the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith use precisely the same slogan as the current leader of the opposition the politic of protest not government year later he be out of his job his own party lack confidence in he and get rid of he we be not able to gamble on political event but what be the odd of history repeat itself here too the opposition crow about the budget but what be their alternative do they oppose the billion investment in our nhs from which magic money tree will they fund their ever spiral spending commitment fix our public finance without compromise our belief in strong nhs be at the heart of this government agenda that be so important because have have countless conversation with constituent who face agonising wait over year for basic operation and with those who dread the am rush to book an appointment at the local gp know full well that they will often be disappoint they know that the nhs need urgent investment but they also know that the nhs must change that be why the investment by this government have be say to be down payment on reform we must transform the way in which our nhs operate otherwise the investment will be waste the nhs serve wholly different population in wholly different context from when the labour party create it in we be live long our health issue be more structural technology can transform our interaction with healthcare provision and patient can feel more empower but we need to get funding into the nhs now the tories want all the benefit of investment but they have no idea how they would pay for it we can look to history again to tell we what happen when conservative make promise without clue about how they would fund they look at the hospital that have not be build look at the billion black hole in our asylum system look at the mini budget the hon gentleman rightly point out the need to invest in the nhs do he recognise that impose nic on primary healthcare provider such as my constituency weldmar hospicecare which provide vital end of life care to resident and must raise day to fund its service will result order that be perfectly long enough that point have be make over and over again in intervention and the health secretary have be very clear that fund allocation for primary care service and other service will be set out in due course as result of this labour government action there will be more money available than there would have be this debate show the opposition to be mere opportunist who be incapable or perhaps unwilling to face up to the difficult decision that we face as country we have see the path that take we down and we can not do that again the chancellor budget have create right mess no matter how regularly the prime minister bleat that he be fix the foundation it be mess of labour own making date stamp october the obr have forensically dismantle the government pathetic fallacy of billion black hole but even if it have not my constituent be not stupid if the chancellor be as worry by the state of the public finance as she say she be why would she increase borrow by billion annually undermine our financial resilience why would she make the choice to splurge cash on union pay rise with no productivity commitment why would she make series of decision that would lead the obr to downgrade its growth forecast since our april budget welcome the extra pay for our teacher and our doctor even if the hon lady do not think that our public sector hero deserve that pay rise do she accept that lose school day cost the economy million and that the nhs have have to spend billion on temporary staffing be interested by the train driver pay deal where the government actually go back to the deal that we have make and undo the productivity commitment that we put in why would the chancellor front load spending on the nhs before the health secretary even have plan for how he will use that precious cash therefore risk billion be waste it make no sense and everyone outside this place and all those inside it apart from the labour members who be gleefully waft their order papers around can see that the chancellor be ask for an extra billion in taxis from the british people and it be largely be take from some of the most productive entrepreneurial people in the country the people who provide job and who do the right thing worry deeply that their good money be go to be pour into the public sector and benefit without any noticeable improvement in public service and that when that happen the chancellor be go to come back for more the incentive for anyone in this country to be entrepreneurial to stick their neck out to take the risk of employ people or to build true wealth for this nation will diminish we will then find ourselves in downward spiral ever more unable to withstand external shock and ever less appealing as country in which our young people will want to stay to create to innovate and to build as we know big chunk of that billion be come from the sneaky rise in employer national insurance something the government obscure from their plan in july but let we start with the pain that the chancellor choice on ni be cause her own cabinet colleague she have blow hole in the budget of every major government department the health secretary now have problem with gps pharmacy social care and hospice the deputy prime minister have council tell she that they have to find over billion extra to pay provider for their service the culture secretary have charity tourism business and cultural venue tell she that they have major problem the education secretary have have to raise tuition fee by million because university be tell she that they now have hole in their budget of exactly the same size it go on want to talk about the pain that this policy be cause to my constituent particularly the lowering of the ni threshold which be whack the kind of business that employ lot of young low wage worker parent get back into the workplace and people who be pick up extra job to make end meet let give some example the first be local after school club provider employ people and offer wraparound club that help out hundred of havering family it be the kind of club that make that work family juggle survivable because of the nics hike and the lowering of the threshold its bill be go to rise from to annually the last thing it want to do be to lose staff or hike fee for local family but it can not see way around that another example be an outdoor activity business that give young people across london the most amazing opportunity its cost next year be go to increase by as direct result of the budget and it now worry that it will not be able to fund the young people bursary that be provide over disadvantaged kid in the region with outdoor experience third be home care business that look after old people in havering its branch in hornchurch face pay an extra year make it loss making from april that be absolutely crazy will the hon lady give way no be afraid there be simply not enough time finally want to mention small private school in my constituency its pupil be some of the most vulnerable and deprive in our capital as it be an alternative provision school first the labour government hit it with vat now they be go to hit it with nic and wage increase either it absorb that cost or it pass it on to the local council those be four business from harold hill to hornchurch provide critical service to my constituent employ young people and give work family opportunity now they be go to be hit by ten of thousand in extra cost and that be before even talk about the gps the pharmacist the dentist the charity the shop the restaurant and the pub it be for they that be go to wholeheartedly order that bring we to the front bench contribution it be pleasure to close this debate on behalf of his majesty loyal opposition recognise that many member have not be able to speak because of the level of concern in the early debate about labour family farm tax in this debate we have hear talk of difficult decision but labour members seem to be in denial about the real world impact of those decision on the organisation in their constituency that have to make difficult decision about wage or job today labour members have an opportunity to stand with their constituent this debate be fundamentally about trust and the promise make by the labour party at the election labour manifesto promise labour will not increase taxis on work people which be why we will not increase national insurance it be clear to everyone what that mean the ifs say that this measure would be straightforward breach of the labour manifesto but labour then choose to break its promise by introduce this billion year job tax once again we have hear the tired claim blame fantasy billion black hole claim debunk by the independent obr as well as by my hon friend the member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez who point out that the government billion pay deal for their union paymaster create lot of that hole the voter be not fool and they know what labour say and do it break its promise to the british people what have be the impact of this billion job tax business confidence be plummet and output have already reduce for the first time in over year the chief secretary to the treasury and labour members have again claim that the impact of this measure be limited but even in the very limited impact assessment he refer to hmrc estimate that business will lose out in net term with an average annual tax increase of per employee the average employer lose out will see its liability increase by year and it be work people who will pay the price with low wage high price and few job many hon member have speak about the impact on charity and organisation in their constituency my thrill seek hon friend the member for hamble valley paul holmes who be glad be still in one piece speak about the hit to hospice that provide vital care which will see high cost amount to ten of million of pound charity will face bill that be billion high marie curie alone will have million hit to its cost the royal college of general practitioners have warn that the extra cost could force surgery to make redundancy or close altogether adult social care provider will see billion hit in the next financial year despite the warning from hospice care home dentist nursery pharmacy and other there have be cold comfort from the minister there have be no clarity on whether support will be provide no clarity on when support might come how much it might amount to or if it will come at all as my hon friend the member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns say give the impact on these group the government should rethink their proposal although job day be create under the conservatives from labour job tax be expect to see job lose and few job create bloomberg estimate that as many as job could be lose but perhaps most concern be the impact on the low pay the obr estimate that of the cost of these measure will be pay by reduce wage lower the level at which employer nic be levy from year to year will hurt part time female and young worker in particular the obr expect this measure to raise billion year on average no wonder the cbi have warn that two third of its member be reduce their plan to take on staff the british retail consortium have also warn of billion hit mean that job loss be inevitable of course this tax will also push up inflation tesco lidl and all the major retailer have say so more expensive weekly shop be the price of this measure we have hear today about the need for investment in public service on which all opposition members agree be happy to highlight our record of record investment in the nhs and climb up the international education league table that progress be now under threat from the government proposal we would have make different choice from this tax raise budget our plan would have grow the economy fast the obr downgrade growth after the budget our plan would have deliver billion of welfare saving but those plan be put in the deep freeze by the labour party we would have improve productivity in the public sector by get back to pre covid level save billion year labour members ask for our idea so there they be some million job be create under conservative government from on youth unemployment be cut by million more disabled people get into work and we have the fast grow economy in the by contrast labour be break promise make only few month ago and choose to put up taxis despite the damage to the economy and to work people the chancellor pledge not to raise further taxis have drop like stone we have see this movie they will be back for more urge hon member to support our motion thank all right hon and hon member for their contribution during the course of the debate this government be elect with an immediate and critical need to draw line under the fiscal irresponsibility and economic mismanagement of the conservatives since day one in office we have be determine to deliver economic stability and we have do so by fix the public finance introduce tough new fiscal rule and get the nhs and other public service back on their foot it be on those foundation that we will boost investment and drive long term economic growth to make people well off this be not an easy task as the chancellor have say but fix those foundation be what underpin all the difficult but necessary decision we have take it be the goal of fix the foundation of our public finance and the nhs that have drive our decision to make the change to employer national insurance contribution that we have be discuss today in take the difficult decision at the budget the chancellor have be determine to protect work people that be why our budget make no change to income tax rate of vat or the amount of national insurance that work people pay as result of our budget people will not see penny more on their payslip however billion black hole in the public finance can not be fix without take any difficult decision at all the conservatives in government hide their head in the sand and ignore the fiscal reality now both they and other opposition party be desperate to have it both way they say that they support extra money for the nhs but they refuse to back the measure to fund it on that point will the minister give way have be very generous over the past hour in give way in this chamber but will not my time be very limited although would like to hear more about the plane the hon gentleman speak about early we have make the tough but necessary choice that this set of circumstance require which be why we have decide to raise employer national insurance contribution the change broadly return national insurance revenue as proportion of gdp to the level they be at before the previous government cut to employee and self employ nic but they do so in way that do not result in high taxis in people payslip they also do so in way that increase protection for small business and charity because we have decide to more than double the employment allowance to and remove the business size threshold that mean that from april all eligible organisation will be able to employ up to four people on the national living wage without pay penny of employer national insurance over half of all employer will pay the same or less national insurance than they do before but we acknowledge that the decision will have an impact for other employer employer will have choice about how they respond to the change and some of those choice will be hard do not have enough time to respond to all the point raise by hon member directly but will briefly respond to the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart he have be intervene all afternoon but he be no long in his place he ask about table in the obr report be sorry to disappoint he but my answer be nowhere near as interesting as suspect he think it might be the table be simply publish in error and have now be correct the government provide support for departments and other public sector employee with the additional employer national insurance contribution liability and separately we have provide an additional increase to local government spending power include million of new grant funding for social care thank all the other hon member who make contribution my hon friend the members for makerfield josh simons for stevenage kevin bonavia for north east derbyshire louise jones for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales and for rother valley jake richards and the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes for hazel grove lisa smart for rutland and stamford alicia kearns for wokingham clive jones and for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez want to briefly respond to the point of order make early by the hon member for south shropshire stuart anderson because welcome the chance to repeat the fact that the obr say in october that its march forecast would have be materially different have it know what the previous government do not share with it at the time of the march forecast be confident that the hansard record be correct it specifically include materially different in quotation and not the rest of my statement be grateful to have have the chance to respond on behalf of the government to the question that have be raise today the decision to make change to employer national insurance be not take lightly it be tough decision for we to take recognise that while half of business and organisation will pay the same or less than before other will face difficult decision of their own we have ask employer to make great contribution and while we do not expect those affect to welcome that hope the majority will understand why we have do it the simple fact of the matter be that our country need government prepare to fix the public finance get public service back on their foot and restore economic stability it be only through an ambitious and fiscally responsible approach that we can boost investment in growth lay the path towards the bright day ahead the previous government have completely lose sight of that my office in the treasury building use to be that of nigel lawson he once say to govern be to choose to appear to be unable to choose be to appear to be unable to govern that very neatly reflect where the conservative party have end up now before as the government the conservatives have give up on effective governing and since then they have give up on effective opposition this vote today come down to choice between irresponsibility on the opposition benches and government prepare to do what be need to build well future it be this labour party in government that be take the tough but necessary decision with once in generation budget to wipe the slate clean and put our country on well path it be this government that have restore economic stability fix the public finance and hardwired fiscal responsibility into the budget make process it be this government that be put the nhs back on its foot raise the national living wage and protect people payslip and it be this government that will invest in our country create wealth in every nation and region and make people across britain well off that be the choice today and that be why we reject the opposition motion question put jim allister gideon amos stuart anderson stuart andrew steffan aquarone edward argar victoria atkins josh babarinde gareth bacon harriett baldwin steve

before call the secretary of state to make his statement remind the house that on november mr speaker grant waiver from the house sub judice resolution in respect of the case of dillon and other the secretary of state for northern ireland as such reference may be make to that case during the statement and the question that follow with permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement on the legacy of the trouble in northern ireland the timing of the statement be choose so as not to take time away from the opposition day debate we have just have while also enable the northern ireland court of appeal to be update today address the legacy of the trouble be one of the aim of the good friday agreement but this task remain incomplete too many family have meet have have to wait too long to find out what happen to their love one have find it difficult to listen to their story about the brutality of the killing the way some of they be treat afterwards and the passing of the year without find answer the approach take to legacy by the last government be wrong it be reject by the northern ireland political party victim group and the irish government and it be oppose by the labour party when we be in opposition aspect of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act have now be find by the court to be incompatible with our obligation under the european convention on human right this must be remedied and the government be commit to repeal and replace that legislation as set out in our manifesto be today lay remedial order under the human rights act to take the first step to honour that commitment this order will remedy all of the human right deficiency in the legacy act identify by the northern ireland high court in february in the case of dillon and other and one issue from the court of appeal judgment in september specifically the order if adopt by parliament will remove all provision from the act relate to the immunity scheme which let it not be forget would have enable any of those who perpetrate the most appalling terrorist crime to seek immunity from prosecution from the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery although as many victim family recognise with the passage of time the prospect of successful prosecution be increasingly unlikely the order will also enable all civil proceeding that be prohibit by the legacy act include future case to proceed this mean that individual will once again be able to bring trouble relate case to the civil court basic right deny they by the legacy act in addition to lay this remedial order can also announce today that will introduce primary legislation when parliamentary time allow this legislation will implement our promise to restore inquest start with those that be previously halt by the legacy act it will also in direct response to the northern ireland court of appeal finding amend the disclosure regime so that it be fair transparent and crucially allow for the great possible disclosure of information follow very closely the model for statutory inquiry and other establish process we will also ensure that in specific circumstance namely in case that be unable to proceed as an inquest the independent commission be able to hold public hearing take swear evidence from individual and ensure that family have effective representation although the court have find the commission be sufficiently independent to conduct article compliant investigation the confidence of family in its work be paramount so we will make further change to reform and strengthen the commission independence power and accountability as part of this work we will consider provision previously include in the draft stormont house agreement legislation as well as learn from the experience of operation kenova the step be outline today seek to correct the mistake of the previous government approach ensure compliance with the echr and deliver on what this government have promise the removal of conditional immunity the reinstatement of legacy inquest halt by the legacy act restore civil case and reform icrir while enable it to continue work on behalf of the grow number of family who have already seek its help the many conversation that have have with interested party in recent month have be invaluable in the development of this approach will now undertake further discussion on specific measure to be include in primary legislation so that together with the remedial order the government fulfil our commitment to repeal and replace the legacy act this will include family victim and survivor group northern ireland party civil society and the veteran community recognise the dedicated service of the vast majority of police officer member of the armed force and the security service who do so much to keep the people of northern ireland safe during the trouble want to take the opportunity to reassure the house that the government be commit to ensure that veteran receive the right welfare and where appropriate legal support will of course also continue to have detailed discussion with the irish government who as co guarantor of the good friday agreement be an essential partner in this process hope that the uk and irish governments will be able to agree way forward that be underpin by the principle set out in the stormont house agreement be sure that everyone recognise that as time pass and family grow old we need to get on with enable they to obtain the information accountability and acknowledgement that they have long seek in parallel the government also need to set out the ground for appeal on element of the court of appeal judgment as have say the government will use primary legislation to respond directly to number of the court of appeal finding on disclosure however the primacy of the executive in decision relate to the security of the state be principle long recognise by uk court and be crucial element of our ability to keep people safe for this reason we will appeal the court specific finding relate to the secretary of state power to preclude the disclosure of sensitive information in circumstance where such disclosure would prejudice the national security interest of the united kingdom furthermore the court finding relate to effective next of kin participation in case that would otherwise be inquest raise issue that could reach far beyond the scope of the legacy act it be important that the government seek legal clarity from the supreme court and that be why we have decide that the government must seek to appeal on this particular issue as well the government will also pursue an appeal in relation to the finding on article of the windsor framework for reason set out in my write ministerial statement of july would like to say as clearly as possible that these decision on appeal be to address wide concern and their potential impact far beyond the legacy act and northern ireland they will not slow down our effort to seek agreement and bring forward legacy legislation so that the icrir which have begin its work can demonstrate its capacity to assist victim and family finally what be all this for it be to ensure that family who have lose love one family who above all should be in our heart and mind today can finally learn what happen nothing will ever ease the pain that they endure to this day but we must hope that society in northern ireland which have come such long way since can begin to heal the terrible wound of the past and look to well future commend this statement to the house call shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement for give an oral statement on this very important subject and for schedule the statement at such time as would not interfere with the opposition day debate that be very decent of he do not intend to rehearse all of the long debate that be have in the last parliament over the legacy act the labour party win the general election on manifesto that include number of measure that the secretary of state have just discuss and it have mandate to make the change it want to make but will say this there be an attempt by the last government desire from the last government to draw line under many difficult thing that have happen and with the action the government be now take that line be be erase will remind the house of the central reason why the last government legislate they do so to try and protect some elderly people include servicemen who be be bring before inquest to discuss event that may or may not have happen very many year before this be process inevitably weight against the police and the armed force who keep record and whose servicemen be easily locatable and contactable tonight there will be many such man harbour sense of dread know the government be take different approach but do ask they to spare thought for those man this evening and to think very deeply about what they can do to support they and what help they can offer they have number of question for the secretary of state appreciate that he may not be able to answer they all this evening so would be grateful if he would undertake to write to on these very important matter the first issue would like to touch on be the icrir which be set up by the legacy act indeed for all the government current talk of want to replace the legacy act very large part of that legislation be concern with its establishment be very pleased early in the year that the secretary of state affirm his support for the icrir and for sir declan morgan who be do an admirable job of oversee it in his statement the secretary of state say that he will reform and strengthen the commission independence power and accountability would be grateful if he could set out exactly how and why he intend to do that give that in september sir declan make it clear that he already have the necessary independence and power to do his job secondly be pleased to hear that the secretary of state intend to appeal the court specific finding regard the secretary of state power to preclude the disclosure of sensitive information in circumstance where disclosure would be prejudicial to national security but will he confirm that in the event that his appeal be unsuccessful the government will legislate to ensure that national security be protect if he do so he will have our support thirdly must ask the secretary of state about the new regime that be emerge it seem rather more by accident than design and how it will work we will have inquest the icrir and inquiry who will decide which route family go down will it be the family the government or the court what criterion will be use how will dispute about the route choose be adjudicate one of the quality of the legacy act be that it greatly simplify the system the system be now be return to complexity finally must ask the secretary of state to give the house some clarity on the government position on article of the windsor framework be pleased that he be continue his appeal against the colton judgment hand down in july that be decision in which the court of appeal seek to disapply statute and in his statement in july he refer to it as technical point of law but it be quite some technicality article of the windsor framework be very important in this judgment and would like he to be able to give clarity on the government position be it as the last government position be that the right available to the people of northern ireland under the belfast agreement should not be diminish as result of our leave the eu or be it that broad range of right available at the time of our departure from the eu should not be diminish as result of leave the eu or be it that the right of the northern irish people should keep pace with eu law as it develop those be incredibly important point of law that will have long consequence in british court would be grateful if he could give the house clarity on those matter be grateful to the hon gentleman for the manner of his response and for acknowledge that the government have mandate to introduce the change have set out today although he do not comment on the fact that number of element of the legislation that the last government put in place have be find to be incompatible with our international obligation under the european convention on human right and that alone be demonstration of the failing of that particular legislation acknowledge the point that the shadow secretary of state raise about veteran and we hold they very close to our heart as know do the defence secretary my right hon friend the member for rawmarsh and conisbrough john healey who be in the chamber this evening the shadow secretary of state ask about the icrir indeed the court have find it to be independent and it have considerable power it be currently investigate first case that refer to it yesterday follow report from the police service of northern ireland the purpose of the change that will be discuss with all the party set out in my statement will be to far build confidence in icrir part of the reason icrir do not currently command the confidence of all survivor and victim group be because it be create in an act that close off any other route of remedy people be tell you can not have civil case you can not have an inquest if you be have an inquest now we be cut it short on the may deadline and the only place you can then go be icrir if may say so that damage confidence in icrir have great confidence in sir declan morgan and people have now start come to icrir and want to build confidence that be the basis of the further change that propose to come to later on on the hon gentleman question on disclosure have to say that if we get leave to appeal we will have to wait and see what the supreme court have to say about that when it come to the different regime as he will know for icrir family can approach it and say would like there to be review or if you think it appropriate an investigation certain people have power to refer case to icrir have just do so in the case have outline it be for the government to decide whether to launch public inquiry yes there be some complexity as the hon gentleman might say but it do give people choice and it do give they their right how could we say to citizen in one part of our important united kingdom that they could no long have the right to bring civil case that be what the legacy act do and that be what the court of appeal have recently find to be incompatible finally on article be not lawyer but think the hon gentleman set out quite well the range of issue that arise out of the way in which the court have thus far interpret article and its application as the court have take what might describe as an expansive view of what article mean compare with what some people might have think when it be originally write it be important for the government and indeed for the country to go to the supreme court and ask which be the right interpretation thank the secretary of state for his statement early this week the northern ireland affairs committee lead by my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi visit northern ireland where it be clear from our discussion with many stakeholder that real progress have be make since but that there be much more to do so first how do the secretary of state think this announcement will bring people in northern ireland together secondly will he tell we when he plan to bring forward the primary legislation to which he refer the answer to my hon friend second question as have already indicate be when parliamentary time allow in answer to his first question hope that people will see government seek to address the evidential shortcoming of the legacy act but it be my wish to achieve as much consensus as possible be not naive and be not go to stand before the house today and think that in the end will get everybody to back the proposal that have already bring forward and will bring forward in due course but all of we in all part of the house should have that aim thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement it have long be recognise that it be neither wise nor sustainable to simply draw line under the past in northern ireland there be too much hurt and there be too many demand for truth and justice the liberal democrats believe that northern ireland must be able to deal with its past in manner that promote reconciliation and be consistent with share future the approach of the previous government be wrong we oppose the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act as do every political party in northern ireland just as work closely with northern ireland political party be crucial to help northern ireland deal with its past so too be have constructive relationship with the republic of ireland to that end we welcome the government new and constructive approach and the announcement of new legislation welcome the northern ireland secretary meeting with micheál martin early this week do the secretary of state believe that we might be make progress towards the irish government withdraw their legal case he say that legislation will be introduce when parliamentary time allow will he offer further insight on when that might be on the icrir think we all agree that it be vital to have body that have the faith and trust of victim and their family and pay tribute to sir declan morgan and his colleague for the work that they have do in hugely challenging circumstance hear what the secretary of state say regard reform the icrir but will he keep on the table the option of replace it entirely should it turn out that such reform do not deliver what we all want to see which be family get the answer they need in manner that promote reconciliation and an institution that command widespread public trust hope that it might be possible to reach agreement with the irish government about how we take this forward whether they withdraw the interstate case be of course entirely matter for they but only yesterday have discussion with micheál martin the justice minister helen mcentee and the under secretary of state for northern ireland in which we discuss these matter regard that dialogue as very important to build confidence in answer to the hon gentleman second question on when the legislation will be forthcoming can only repeat myself when parliamentary time allow on his third question on keep open the prospect of abolish icrir simply say that one could do that there be those who would argue for it that would bring to halt the case that have already start and to each of those family who have take the decision to approach icrir that case really matter we would be say to they right forget that and we would waste all the money that have be put into establish icrir so that it have the capacity to do its work and waste another year or two as have say nobody be get any young in the end in most of the discussion that have have have ask people do you think we need an information recovery function they have say yes have ask do you think that we need means of continue investigation they have say yes that be what be contain in the stormont house agreement and be not yet persuade that scrap that to recreate something that end up look not dissimilar from what we have at the moment be terribly sensible or pragmatic approach to take however be open to conversation in the way that set out about what more we can do on icrir to increase the public confidence in it thank the secretary of state for his statement be in belfast this week with other member of the northern ireland affairs committee and it be clear that all section of northern ireland society be oppose to the legacy act as it be constitute will the secretary of state work with all stakeholder go forward include the irish government as he plan new way forward on legacy and as he consider how to have full co operation from the irish government in relation to information they may hold on legacy case be very happy to give my hon friend that assurance have have lot of meeting and discussion already and to quote that phrase shall have further such meeting over the next few month because be determined to work as hard as can to try as indicate moment ago to find way forward the discussion that we have have thus far with the irish government who be resolutely oppose to the legislation that the previous government put on the statute book along with everybody else and the fact that we have demonstrate our willingness to be open to debate about change that can be make have be real step forward welcome the secretary of state statement disagree with both the manner and the detail of the last government act this tilt back in favour of the rule of law and in favour of family will he continue to manage the expectation of family give the impact of the passage of time will he press the irish government on omagh on dublin and monaghan and on specific terrorist atrocity that they have information on and we need they now to pass over be very grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question he play distinguished role during his time as secretary of state he know as know and we all know the importance of try to build consensus to move forward he raise the question of omagh raise that with micheál martin only yesterday welcome very much the commitment that the irish government have give to co operate with the omagh inquiry and know that the inquiry look forward to receive that co operation in the month ahead thank the secretary of state for the decisive action that he have announce today and for bring it to we in the house nothing can be allow to jeopardise the progress that have be make in northern ireland will he confirm that the thread run through this action and any future action be the government firm commitment to the victim and family and to get they the answer that they so richly deserve and finally need be very happy to give my hon friend that assurance have talk tonight about lot of process future legislation remedial order and so on that be why say at the end of my statement that in the end this be about the family the family whom many member in the house will have meet who still do not know what happen and who carry the incredible pain from what they have be through with they to this day the very least we can do be to try really really hard to find way of give they the answer that they have be seek welcome the fact that the government as part of their appeal will appeal the way in which the scope of article have be extend even to include overreach into national policy say to the secretary of state that as long as article remain there will always be contention about how much say the eu will have not only on law and activity in northern ireland but on policy make in this house on the decision he have make on inquest civil case and disclosure the secretary of state have to be honest with this house that be not go to result in terrorist be take through the court or through the process in northern ireland it will result only in age member of the security force be drag once again through the court and suffering as result of the service they give in northern ireland he say he intend to continue to speak with the irish government the irish government have shamelessly take our government to court while do nothing about the collusion and activity of the irish state and irish security force in aid and abet the killing of soldier and genocide along the border will the secretary of state ensure that if there be discussion on legacy they address the past sin they be guilty of in deal with the legacy of the trouble it be important that everyone face up to the consequence of what happen and of what they do or do not do everyone it be painful and difficult process indeed the implication of what have announce to the house today be that nobody can escape prosecution because the immunity that be offer by the legacy act have be remove if there be evidence although acknowledge to the house that with the passage of time that become more and more difficult for reason the right hon gentleman allude to at least that possibility remain on article would simply point out that this agreement be reach between the british government and the european union and it be the british court not the european court that have interpret it that be why the government be of the view that we should seek to get definitive ruling on the nature of that interpretation from the supreme court on november we mark the anniversary of the birmingham pub bombing that date will have be feel most heavily by the family of the people who never come home and by many more who still carry the mental and physical scar of that day the secretary of state know that the announcement of the repeal of the legacy act be welcome at the time it be make will he agree to enter into correspondence on the potential implication of his announcement tonight for that campaign be grateful to my hon friend for raise that appalling atrocity when be the shadow secretary of state for northern ireland meet number of the birmingham family over video they have live for so long with the pain and suffering and of course with the fact that the people who be put in jail for allegedly have do it have not do it which have only add to their distress because it happen in great britain it be matter for the home office however would say that icrir be now begin to look at the case of the guildford pub bombing why it be because the family have approach icrir would just point out that it be open to the birmingham family if they wish to approach icrir and ask it to look at what happen to their love one be less enthusiastic than many people for this development if as the secretary of state say the purpose be for the family to find out the truth can he confirm first of all that the northern ireland sentences act remain in be so that if somebody be prosecute successfully for the most heinous of offence they will not serve whether they be from the armed force on the one side or the terrorist force on the other more than two year in jail give that that be the case which be the more likely to give the family the truth try to take people to court where they will defend their position and try to cover up inconvenient fact or try to have an amnesty that hat word couple with truth recovery process where the truth can be say because people know that they will not go to jail as result clearly legislation on the statute book and the provision that it contain remain in place until such time as it change on the right hon gentleman important point about what the family would prefer the answer must lie with the family themselves as know he will also have do have meet very large number of family lot of they acknowledge that prosecution be unlikely but want the truth some of they still want there to be prosecution for justice to be do our responsibility be to give family and the body investigate on their behalf the mean to provide the answer that the family after all these year be look for as veteran pay tribute to the service of those police officer member of the armed force and the security service who do so much to keep people in northern ireland safe during the trouble and in some case pay the ultimate price none the less any solution that do not have the support of victim group and political party in northern ireland be not in my view tenable can the secretary of state assure that any veteran affect will receive all welfare and if appropriate legal support where necessary can indeed give my hon friend that assurance it be absolutely what we should do when we be think in this particular case of those who serve in the armed force the people who serve in northern ireland as part of operation banner in this place on september the secretary of state make statement with regard to another inquiry at that point ask he whether for those family who have lose love one to terrorism he have close down all the other option for an inquiry he tell at that point that icrir would be the only option my understanding tonight be that he have now put back on the table several case inquest and inquiry what confidence do those family now have in icrir when the secretary of state say tonight that it need reform that he will bring forward further proposal to reform it and that he have not detail they on the stormont house agreement remind he that the ulster unionist party do not support it on the one inquiry announce to the house in relation to the murder of pat finucane explain the unique circumstance that lead to reach that conclusion if may correct the hon gentleman inquiry be never take off the table as an option they have remain on the table it be for the government of the day to decide whether public inquiry be order or not he be right that civil case and inquest in due course will return it be the case that some people do not have confidence in icrir that be why think it be important that we should take further step to try to build that confidence but have no doubt about its capacity to do the job that be require on behalf of the family that seek its help as make clear in the house previously in the end icrir effectiveness will be judge by those family do they get the answer that they have seek for so long by approach it know that sir declan morgan be really commit to make sure that he can do that like number of other serve in northern ireland we do not ask to go and lose very good friend there and other at the same time that man parent die without ever know what have happen to he but it turn out that he may well have be dismember and disappear completely there be no closure for they and there be no chance unless ireland open up its book and look into this that we will ever get any justice for he he have family as well and many friend who wonder what happen to that brave man and there be many more like he so say on their behalf yes let there be justice for family but let we not forget all those soldier who will now in some case be hound for no reason at all those who lose their friend and their child and who do not want to go there in the first place where be the justice for they let first thank the right hon gentleman for his service in northern ireland let also say how sad be to hear about the case that he have just describe justice information should be must be available to all would just point out however that there be service personnel who lose their life in the conflict in northern ireland who do not support the legacy act precisely because it propose to give immunity to people who have kill their love one that be another reason why think it be right to remove immunity from the statute book which the remedial order that have lay before the house today will do welcome the news that the government be to pursue an appeal in relation to the finding on article of the windsor framework in the dillon judgment trust that it be not just an academic pursuit to find out which be the right interpretation but determination on the part of the government to resist the imposition on northern ireland through the windsor framework of law right and expectation that do not apply anywhere else in the united kingdom if the secretary of state fail in his appeal to the supreme court will he undertake to legislate to the effect that article can not have effect in domestic law in northern ireland the secretary of state have say that he will be bring to icrir the same disclosure right that apply to statutory inquiry why then do we need the finucane inquiry if icrir will now have the same power he say that he would discuss the way forward with the government of the irish republic they be government who have be vigorous in demand accountability from the british government but give no accountability as to their own force and support for terrorism across the border for many year as the hon gentleman will know the purpose of article be to ensure that there be no diminution in the right of people in northern ireland as result of our withdrawal from the european union certainly support that principle and hope that the hon gentleman do as well the last government think it right to put it in place because they negotiate that arrangement in respect of an appeal we will just have to wait and see what the supreme court if we reach that point and it go there have to say will not prejudge either verdict or indeed what might flow from that let just remind the hon gentleman in relation to the finucane inquiry that there be very specific reason the previous labour government have make commitment that in certain case if an independent judge determine that there be public inquiry we would hold one and believe that when government make commitment we should keep our word welcome the news that the secretary of state will repeal the legacy act this be something that the previous government say this with great respect simply do not get right and this government now have an opportunity to get it right the secretary of state have outline the great scope for investigation and inquiry lead an adjournment debate in the last parliament about the kingsmill worker murder by the ira in newry and would seek an inquiry for they for the victim of the la mon massacre in which the ira murder numerous innocent people and for the four ballydugan soldier murder on april stuart montgomery be three week out of police training college when he be murder by the ira in pomeroy my cousin kenneth smyth be murder by the ira on december his friend daniel mccormick be murder beside he raymond mccord son be murder by loyalist could mention many many other will all those who seek justice be able to access that which they have request in the past which they have be deny so often and equal to the decision for the finucane family can the secretary of state please far expand on the support that will ensure that there will be no witch hunt against armed force and ruc officer who serve honourably for crown and country apologise for the emotion the hon gentleman have no reason to apologise to anybody because he have just demonstrate what say in my statement about the pain that endure to this day on the part of family who have lose dearly love family member the way that he put his question and the emotion that he be not afraid to show think he have no control over it of course not because this be how we feel when we reflect on these terrible incident he mention one of those killing and here we be in december which be particularly difficult time of year there be number of anniversary and we be approach christmas when we feel the loss of love one so greatly we have to work together as hard as we can to provide if it be possible because it may not be possible in all case the mean through which the family can get some answer about what happen but in the end each family have to come to term with the loss that they have endure in their own way can not think of anything that be more difficult to do but we need to stand with they every step of the way stand with the hon gentleman he be my hon friend in say that thank the secretary of state both for come to the house to give his statement and indeed for the timing of it it be hugely appreciated petition pimp website and pay for sex rise on the day of the un day of activism against gender base violence to present petition on commercial sexual exploitation on behalf of my constituent in neath and swansea east pimp website be use by trafficker to advertise and facilitate the sexual exploitation of woman our law against pimping have fail to keep pace with technological change and such website be now readily accessible and play key role in enable sex trafficking in this country victim of trafficking and exploitation be some of the most vulnerable in our society and it be our duty to protect they the petition therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to outlaw pimp website and pay for sex and provide support not sanction to victim of sexual exploitation follow be the full text of the petition the petition of resident of the constituency of neath and swansea east declare that demand from the minority of man who pay for sex be drive the prostitution and sex trafficking trade and this sexual exploitation be be facilitate by pimp website that operate with impunity the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to outlaw pimp website and pay for sex and provide support not sanction to victim of sexual exploitation and the petitioner remain etc end of radio teleswitch service rural areas motion make and question propose that this house do now jones be pleased to raise the issue of the radio teleswitch service decommissioning in the house this evening this be pressured and important matter for household in my constituency further household across the north of scotland and fully household across great britain the ending of the radio teleswitch service or rts which control total heating with total control meter be of vital importance to electric only customer and yet remain troubled landscape to some extent rts be radio signal that tell total heating with total control meter when to switch between peak and off peak rate and this obsolete system will come to an end on june it be originally go to cease on march but that have to be push back because the system be not ready that should have be when alarm bell start to ring customer be be ask to switch to smart meter and energy uk the trade body for energy supplier have advise customer what could happen if they do not you may find that your heating hot water be continually leave on or off or the charging up happen at the wrong time of day your electricity supplier will be able to confirm how much electricity you have use during peak or off peak time which mean your electricity cost could be much high than before however accurate that message might be it could easily be source of alarm for customer any of we who have have the misfortune to have electric only heating will realise that even with the discount rate it be still ferociously expensive so the idea that anyone could have it without the discount rate be simply not realistic like my hon friend have significant concern about the end of rts in rural scotland moray west nairn and strathspey have disproportionate number of rts meter and include myself in that statistic my own experience with ovo energy and switch to smart meter from rts have leave lot to be desire have have several telephone conversation with ovo representative as private customer regard the rts switchover the main question have during those phone call be if switch will be well or bad off or pay the same as be now for electricity have to push extremely hard to get straight answer to that if that be the difficulty be experience as someone who be experience in assist constituent with this very issue do my hon friend share my concern about how more vulnerable people who may feel immense pressure from operator instal new meter will be impact thank my hon friend for his intervention he have raise couple of point one be really important and that be whether or not customer have an option they actually do not have realistic option the radio teleswitch service be come to an end at the end of june next year and they will not want to be in the position where they do not have smart meter that can toggle between reduce rate tariff and full price tariff that would be ruinously expensive my hon friend also touch on the communication and the quality thereof that supply company be have with their customer one of the reason that the uptake be so slow be that people do not have confidence in smart meter and why would they there be plenty of problem with the smart meter roll out just for regular electricity customer who want to know how much electricity they be use the stake be far high for electric only customer who heat their home with electricity they need confidence that their smart meter will actually work will come on to that point in second my hon friend mention energy uk and my hon friend the member for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter mention the number of people in his constituency who use the service think it be in the region of in aberdeenshire north and moray east those people need clarity about what be go to happen do my hon friend agree that household need clarity on these proposal and that the government should use all mean available to they to ensure that the roll out be fair and that reassurance be provide to customer the operative word of my hon friend intervention be fair and will come on to exactly who own the risk in my discussion beforehand with the hon gentleman mention what would be refer to in this intervention we have similar issue in northern ireland so do the hon gentleman agree that the need of rural area need to be take into consideration the current cost of live crisis centre on an energy crisis so we need to ensure that people be not pay more because they be unaware of the step that need to be take to deal with this change the hon gentleman be right that northern ireland be different energy market from great britain but there will be without question electric only customer in the large settlement of northern ireland know that northern ireland be heavy user of heating oil but the same scenario will exist in northern ireland although it be different energy market the same department have to have oversight of the equity and effectiveness of whatever solution be find for that part of the united kingdom constituent have contact with concern that they be be ask to switch to smart meter without guarantee that the smart meter will work properly some customer with poor reception who have switch to smart meter be be ask by their supplier to submit manual reading it be not clear whether manual reading be compatible with alternative economy tariff as these be base not only on how much energy be use but on when that energy be use the data communications company manage smart meter network which can reach of property and more than half of home in gb be already connect information be transmit over wide area network use mobile phone or radio signal send from each property communication hub but the method of transmission differ in central and southern gb smart meter datum be transmit use cellular and wireless mesh technology provide by virgin media whereas in the north of england and all of scotland it be transmit over long range radio signal provide by arqiva it would be safe to say that there remain substantial concern about the ability to have two way communication between supplier and customer over this system this be no small part of the reason for the hesitancy common among total heating with total control customer to rush towards the need to switch the hon gentleman have touch on the fact that radio teleswitching be go it be an analogue technology and we will be fortunate if it last until next june it could collapse at any second it will be replace by smart meter and surely it be not beyond the wit of man to design smart meter that provide something like total heating with total control they do not at present but that be just because they be not design to do so be it not the case that this could be fix if the regulator get the company and the different player together and tell they to produce something that suit the customer not just themselves the right hon gentleman will have no small number of these customer in his constituency and he touch on the important point of the vagueness around this customer be be tell that they must do this and when they ask for any detail about that which they must do it be scant vague and conflicting we only have to look at the forum on the energy company website and on facebook to see that peer to peer support be answer people question on this issue rather than there be cohesive and comprehensive programme of information from the government the department the regulator and the energy company work in concert in professional and coherent way to let customer know exactly what be go to happen on the speed of the roll out the energy supplier the uk government and consumer group have commit to co operate to replace rts meter prior to the shutdown which be pretty minimal commitment the energy company that have pledge their participation be british gas edf octopus ovo scottish power so energy sse total energies utilita and utility warehouse through its call to action the industry have commit to several measure include zero in on regional hot spot with the high number of rts customer that be good but it be late the industry have catch up job in public relation and customer confidence which it need to accept and resource the industry have commit to expedite meter upgrade for rts customer give prioritisation to vulnerable customer for upgrade co operate to solve technical issue and pool knowledge and expertise across company this should not be competitive commercial endeavour it should be call to action across energy company different house be wire up in different way to accommodate total heating total control they will interact differently with smart meter when they be fit which need to be reconcile the industry have commit to issue monthly report on meter replacement urge right hon and hon member to focus on those monthly update because the problem we have be that if we continue to replace rts meter at the current rate that will take until when we only have until june that be why my constituent and be so concerned to be fair the industry be also concerned it want the transition to work because it want its customer to be supply and to be pay for that supply the industry be not try to make this not happen quite the opposite but we need to change gear and pace industry be confident that it have the capacity to deliver for every home but not if all those home come forward in april may and june that will not work which be why we need call to action now we be into december and nothing will happen before the new year so we need to ensure that we hit the ground run in january with this matter as priority make sure the minister have advance sight of my question so she could respond at the end of the debate be she confident that all property will have smart meter instal by the deadline what option be available to rts customer with poor or no mobile signal or no ability to receive the radio signal at their property will there be an option in extremis when it be demonstrate that the signal can not be receive at the property for the customer to have some type of timer solution with or without smart meter will standard tariff be rule out as an option give that it would be ruinously expensive for any customer what action have be take with industry to ensure that customer receive tariff at the same rate or well than that which they have on their total heating total control rate that be key concern for my constituent what step will the government take to ensure that the electrical system and the statutory and commercial entity that control that electrical system will carry the risk for inflate bill as result of the change consumer have no responsibility whatsoever for the functioning of the electricity system so by any measure of justice they should not be expose to the financial risk of system that no long work and be be replace by one that be more expensive that should not happen thank the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan for bring this important issue to the attention of the house as will set out later it be important that people who will be affect by the transition be aware of the issue and the step we need to take to upgrade reassure he that we be do everything we can to ensure that the transition be do with consumer in mind and that it work for the household we know will be affect since the the radio teleswitch service have play an important role in help many consumer to have low cost energy for heating and hot water however as have be acknowledge the technology be come to the end of its life the continuation of the bbc longwave radio signal be due to end on june we have already extend the service once from march this year when the service end as have already be point out there will no long be the availability to switch between rate in some instance consumer may lose control of their heating or hot water with the deadline fast approach can not stress enough that this be big issue for we it be priority and we understand that there be job of work to do to ensure that we can deliver the transition for consumer the minister be absolutely right raise that with the former prime minister at prime minister question early this year and he agree to convene roundtable where we get everybody in the room because there have just be too much blame pass around the various partner that meeting get overtake by the election but it happen without parliamentarian at the table will the minister now look at the possibility of reconvene that meeting with parliamentarian so that there be that element of accountability at the table yes be very keen to reconvene that it be absolutely essential that we work with hon member across the house who represent constituency that we know will be affect from our perspective we have big job to engage consumer to ensure that they be aware and that the transition be work we be keen to work across the house to do that one of the outcome of the roundtable that be put in place be that the taskforce have be establish with ofgem industry and the government to manage the transition and to put and inject the urgency that we need to see in the ongoing process in october the industry sign up to call to action represent collective agreement to take the step need to speed the transition away from rts specific action that be include in that call for action be target of resource towards regional hotspot where we know there be high number of rts customer and we know that we need to do work to reach they fast tracking of meter upgrade for rts customer and in particular vulnerable customer who we be very worried about and collaboration on some of the technical solution that we know be need we be clear that the delivery of the transition away from rts require active engagement with consumer as they will need to agree to appointment collaborate with their installer and ensure that they have the right solution in place do the minister agree that there need to be change of tone and language it be all very well for the government the regulator or the company to feel the urgency but if customer do not sense that we will not get the pace that be require she talk about how it be big job and we can all agree on that it be big job that need to be complete in very little time so it be not just about the scale but about the pace if we can not get customer energise and exercise about the need to get that do that pace will not happen completely agree with the hon member we have say to supplier that they must inform all affected customer by december to make sure that we be inject that sense of urgency both within the supply chain and critically among customer there be collective job for we all to make sure that those who be affect be aware that this be happen that be why this debate be so important that be why be keen to engage with member from across the house to ensure that we be get that message out to constituent critically the taskforce have be ask to establish work partnership with local authority housing provider and other customer face organisation so that we can get the word out that this be happen that customer need to engage and that they must get in touch with their supplier so we can provide the good possible option for they as we move forward my experience be that the energy company have be in touch with the tone of the email have be quite pushy which be what we be talk about in that they need to be push quite hard on customer to make that change and get the right meter in place however when have subsequently be in touch with they do not have smart meter yet it be come in january the first time there be no appointment and they be unable to answer that simple question of whether it will be cheap can not stress enough how much have have to push they to get that answer out of they be not vulnerable customer understand why this be happen like everybody else in the chamber vulnerable customer however may just accept that there be sense of urgency that need to be inject but it need to come with note of caution about how it be inject and how it be communicate and it need to make sure that customer understand how much they be likely to be pay there also need to be transitional arrangement so that if somebody get the wrong tariff they be not penalise for that and it can be change thank the hon member for raise his personal experience of the issue from the perspective of the government it be very important that we have sight of where it be not work because we need to ensure that it be work for consumer there be question about capacity that we be very exercised about we be try to work with supplier to ensure particularly in rural area that we be put in roam team and build the capacity to be able to respond in way that be timely and sensitive to the fact that we be ask consumer to make transition and go through disruption smart meter be the natural upgrade for rts and we have energy supplier that will be offer they if we get this right smart meter be an opportunity to upgrade people home and critically for they to access smart tariff that will give they great control and reduce bill urge consumer to discuss the option with their energy supplier acknowledge that particularly in rural area where we have large number of rts user we have low level of smart meter coverage and installer capacity to address that we be actively encourage energy supplier to ensure that they be build capacity we be look at roam team and how we manage demand across different geography we know that there be issue with network coverage and we be work with the data communication company to ensure that we be resolve they in minority of case where household can not connect we be advise they to engage with their energy supplier to think about the right solution for their home it would be remiss of not to acknowledge that customer have genuine concern and scepticism about smart meter we have receive that intelligence as much as other hon member have across the house it be worth say that there be million smart and advanced meter in home and small business across the of all smart meter our analysis and datum suggest that of smart meter be send automatic signal and working but for too many customer the experience of smart metering be not as good as it ought to be the number of meter that be not work across the country be problematic and we be try to build confidence there be really important job for we to do in work with the regulator to deal with those particular issue the government be work with ofgem to introduce new guarantee standard of performance to improve and protect consumer experience with smart meter offer compensation when the system be fall short for consumer ofgem will be consult to introduce those new standard in the new year let end by touch on the wide point about public confidence which be key to we get this transition right acknowledge that some consumer have lose faith in the energy supplier and the level of satisfaction have damage consumer confidence we hear that when we engage with customer we absolutely must and be try to do more to prioritise and protect consumer in the transition both with rts and more widely on home upgrade and our warm home plan that be why the government be strengthen the regulator to ensure that it can hold company to account for wrongdoing and can require high standard of performance as well as ensure that there be automatic consumer compensation where failure occur there be lot to do but hope have reassure the house that we be aware of the challenge and be do everything we can to grip the problem and to get the regulator and supplier to work with partner on the ground to make the transition as smooth as possible again thank the hon member for angus and perthshire glens for raise the profile of this important issue and highlight the need of all community we have to get this right and confirm my desire to work in concert with hon member across the house to make this as easy for constituent as possible question put and agree to sit adjourn
