aluminium in banbury go while new one such as logistic with company such as dhl and twe haulage food processing with fine lady bakeries and go fresh and high end mechanical engineering with the haas formula team and prodrive come in instead other industry such as brewing move within the constituency we can no long get pint in hunt edmunds pub but hooky beer from hook norton be on sale across the united kingdom the building of the in many way permanently change banbury from small semi industrial market town into something completely different thousand of new home have go up as our area have become increasingly attractive for commuter to oxford and london but we still have council waiting list that have quadruple in decade and private sector that can not meet the need meanwhile vital infrastructure such as school road and health service have fail to meet demand pose fair question from the community for those like who support the government ambitious house building agenda while they have change banbury chipping norton charlbury and the village of north and west oxfordshire have not lose their sense of community the community unite across political divide and none in defence of our local horton general hospital when it be face with downgrading successfully fight it off in and less successfully in as the use of food bank grow in the year after people across the area come together to help support those in need for example the chippy larder in chipping norton have become much love community resource food security in banbury can not be consider without mention our rural farming community and perhaps the most famous farm in the country clarkson farm for all the entertainment that the series have provide for the most important aspect of it be the light that it shin on

bring elton john out of retirement unfortunately private investment in the uk since the global financial crisis have be much less rocket man and more tiny dancer over the last decade and half britain have experience much large slowdown in the growth of capital intensity than comparative country such as the us france and germany and it be that alongside our skill growth which account for our productivity puzzle very much welcome the appointment of john van reenen the wonderful lse economist to our council of economic advisors he have do important work on productivity in the uk and he suggest that our post financial crisis fall in productivity growth be primarily due to large fall in capital accumulation in other word british worker be be hold back by low level of public and private investment and that be what our government need to unlock to succeed in our growth mission we will provide stability but stability alone be not enough in the century we must do more to provide industry and business leader with the leadership that they require to navigate our increasingly complex geopolitical world in which there be fragmentation of supply chain across the world as well as

that no working age person in this country have see start up go to the ftse top in the united states eight out of have experience that in the last decade of innovation britons in this country and in the vale of glamorgan have be deny the opportunity of shape their destiny decline no more because know from speak to investor include those at the summit that they believe what know with this labour government change be on the way and have begin my role have be to put the vale of glamorgan front and centre in that wave of change but start by also recognise the dual impact that change in this house always have for every maiden contribution there be contribution that have be and in my case wish to recognise that of my predecessor the right hon alun cairns conservative mp for the vale of glamorgan for year in those year alun serve our constituency with sincerity in fact he be so sincere that remember knock on door in cadoxton in barry with the good constituency labour party in the country only to have my hope dash by lovely elderly lady who say be go to be vote for alun the good labour mp this town have ever have we all carry an inflated sense of our personal vote in this house beyond our political allegiance but in that moment have to say that feel and see one congratulate alun on his service and wish he the good with the inevitable duality of change that we share but also commit to he some continuity in the service that he and his predecessor the labour mp john smith offer the constituent of the vale of glamorgan and continuity also because the cause of barry development which know alun initiate will echo for year to come as my top priority too offer continuity because in fact the vale of glamorgan stand out for its continuity there be continuity as the world centre of education it be in llantwit major and st illtud church that the uk first college be sit not only home to st illtud but also host to st david in the early sixth century in be in cowbridge in that one of the first gorsedd of the bards be host by iolo morganwg since then font of appreciation for the welsh language welsh literature and welsh poetry there be continuity not just in education but in energy with barry be the world powerhouse and the large coal export port in this country and indeed the large in the world in and with aberthaw not just one of the most advanced power plant of its time but now the host of my and my constituent future dream of centre of excellence in green energy alongside energy and education there be continuity in the world pinnacle of natural beauty title will only share perhaps with my hon friend the member for bangor aberconwy claire hughes with our share welsh background my hon friend from dorset and devon might have the jurassic coast but confess that in the heritage coast of the vale of glamorgan we have every bit of the beauty and the history and perhaps for be well keep secret bright future too finally there be continuity not just across education energy and the beauty that we have but in the heart and humour of the people of the vale of glamorgan barry be the town that host gavin and stacey and in particular the heart and humour of uncle bryn my favourite character who when drive down the blast out james blunt song have be personal inspiration to each time leave this esteemed chamber for the even more esteemed comfort of barrybados have see the heart of the community spirit across the vale of glamorgan in big bocs bwyd which be an initiative across school that start in barry and now go beyond it ensure that no child go hungry when they be learn there be the real struggle and the fight that see each week in the vale domestic abuse services in my constituency fight the onslaught of violence against woman that we have see not just in the vale but across this country and there be the powerful heart of the voice choir of barry llantwit major and cowbridge which be able to combine the pure heart of calon lân with the deep optimism of the greatest showman in one night come here with news of the heart and humour of the vale of glamorgan but also to report its honest challenge we

the honest challenge of our beautiful farmland where third and generation farming family be fight great but difficult fight against the combine challenge of weather disease and uncertainty we have the honest challenge of the veteran of the vale of glamorgan who be not seek the world but simply seek bit of public service for the exceptional national service they give we money do not buy most thing in life it do not solve most of our problem but its absence and the deprivation entrench over the last decade be at the root of many of they in particular that have chip away at the dignity of my community that be why come here with the twin ambition of great prosperity and deep bond of dignity in the vale of glamorgan and across the uk do so not as political slogan or out of political theory but out of history of personal gratitude because it be year ago that the vale of glamorgan and south wales include cardiff offer newly arrive set of parent the opportunity of minimum wage and night shift to subsidise the sleep of their young boy in the absence of any holiday it be barry island that first give those two young boy the opportunity of relief and perhaps even some delight over the weekend it be south wales where grow up with my brother in situation of particular economic stress where feel through the deep privilege of education that could go on to advise the prime minister and the civil service to advise ftse board across the city to invest in tomorrow inventor and ultimately to stand before the house as wales first member of parliament from an ethnic minority background when stand for my twin ambition of prosperity and dignity for the vale will do so out of that personal history of gratitude for as long as serve as the vale voice here in westminster will fight each day for the people in my community
