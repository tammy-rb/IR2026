the shadow foreign secretary have set out in eloquent term what be effectively the policy of the government and the entire house he chide the government for not offer statement today but suggest that the government have not be slow in come to the house with frequent statement and response to urgent question and we will of course continue to do so the right hon gentleman ask about the government discussion with prime minister netanyahu the prime minister the foreign secretary and indeed the entire government have be very clear about our advice to prime minister netanyahu and have set it out repeatedly in the house when last answer question from the right hon gentleman here make very clear our position on rafah as well he ask about the consequence and how we deal with those britain and our ally through the united nations and remind he that britain be pivotal in secure security council resolution and be work together to try to improve what be terrible situation and we will continue to do just that with hope the support of the whole house first draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests this have be typically excellent debate across the house think there be an understanding that after two or three decade of relative tranquillity we be live with the threat of proximate warfare the price of freedom be of course eternal vigilance and that be generally agree across this house as evidence by the contribution make such as that of my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis think my right hon friend be argue slightly cheekily for defence spending of of gdp although that be probably in the event of total war which of course we all want to avoid his proposition be that we should never have take peace dividend post the cold war but think that be little harsh on our predecessor however plainly the situation have change and we must change with it hope very much that europe will follow our commitment mean billion more for our collective defence against the primary aggressor would have be very disappointed have my right hon friend not rehearse the argument for continuous at sea deterrent which of course be tonne of eternal vigilance the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey and for garston and halewood maria eagle who speak for the opposition think give we the commitment we be seek which be to match the government cash spend however the right hon gentleman be bit flaky if may say so on the or at least on when it would be achieve and how they would pay for it that become clear from the intervention by my hon friend the member for north wiltshire james gray for which be grateful the right hon member for wentworth and dearne be indeed an honourable man and like he very much but be bind to point out that his assurance that labour be the party of defence run contrary to its management until very recently by right hon member who have very different idea indeed the right hon gentleman be very keen to recommend the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn to the british public in as the prime minister of this great country and to serve under his leadership for nearly five year but heaven love sinner bring to repentance be also bind to point out that defence be not short of review and another review would mean obfuscation suggest that be the very last thing our armed force need right now at well it would introduce huge measure of uncertainty when we simply can not afford it the chair of the select committee on defence my right hon friend the member for horsham sir jeremy quin rightly reflect on what across the nato alliance would mean where britain lead our european ally must follow we be not in this on our own he give magisterial romp around the geopolitical societal and economic contribution of the whole defence enterprise the hon member for west dunbartonshire martin docherty hughes get tie up with nomenclature there be other rank in the army and the raf and ordinary seaman in the navy and think that be the essence of his confusion either way there be nothing ordinary about the man and woman of our armed force and either way he be rightly concerned about the junior rank recall previous conversation we have in this place during which he confuse pay award this year for they which be with the for senior officer assume he be happy with that he want more europe in defence which think mean more european union he may have miss for example the lancaster house treaty the attendant programme and unmanned aerial vehicle and he may also have miss the joint expeditionary force we be indeed co operate wherever we can with our european friend and neighbour my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois give very detailed and authoritative account of kit major on air defence he catalogue some of the procurement issue that have historically bedevil the defence enterprise but he resist reference to his favourite defence contractor for which we be very grateful know that he support the integrate procurement model announce in february the right hon member for warley john spellar to whom always listen with great deal of interest rightly highlight industrial skill have say it before but will say it again the ministry of defence be this country no employer of apprentice and we be exceptionally proud of that he rightly imply that the man and woman of our armed force both civilian and people in uniform have choice of course they do and they very often exercise it our economy be the well for it make no apology for inject trade and skill into our armed force and our defence enterprise it benefit we all the trick be retain those people and then perhaps pull they back in at some future date he will be familiar with that because he have read the haythornthwaite report my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin rightly highlight the peril of coalition but to be fair we have get the liberal democrats to commit to casd and maybe even casd with missile for that the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord have do we great service today the point that my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex make about leadership be extremely well make the hon member for halton derek twigg speak about the recruitment and retention issue that the armed force certainly have in common with just about all our ally meanwhile we deal with all our defence commitment we be rightly proud of the man and woman who serve the right hon member for north durham mr jones be fight bit of rearguard action on defence spending which the opposition front benchers now say they support if he want to disregard the cost for ukraine he need to have word with his colleague give that need to face down putin naked aggression he might as well carve out other part of the defence budget and say that they do not count either be sure he would not want to do that my hon friend the member for north wiltshire speak about vote in parliament and about warfighting and agree with his analysis we forget do we grave mistake the iraq war be have be heavily involve with the effort and the process entirely agree with his remark about lgbt people and salute the role that the all party parliamentary group for the armed force play early on in that process the hon member for tiverton and honiton speak about variety of subject interestingly at the end of his remark he commit his party to think regular army of be not quite sure where that figure come from but assume we will hear about the attendant spending pledge in due course or maybe not my hon friend the member for filton and bradley stoke jack lopresti talk about apprentice defence relate job and that be not surprising give that abbey wood in filton put his constituency at the beat heart of the defence enterprise he be constant advocate for both the hon member for strangford jim shannon be strong advocate for the defence enterprise in northern ireland and his part in particular he rightly highlight the further opportunity in northern ireland which know about full well as former northern ireland office minister and chair of the northern ireland affairs committee my hon friend the member for bracknell james sunderland speak of enablement and logistic of interoperability modularity and plug and play from position of real expertise as former senior logistic officer my hon friend the member for isle of wight bob seely rightly highlight the change nature of warfare mass matter but so do tech as we can see with potential game changer such as dragonfire be not sure agree with he about but we can perhaps have debate later over cuppa or some such in our more dangerous world the government believe that spend of gdp on defence must become the minimum nato benchmark as putin ramp up his wartime economy as part of network of authoritarian state that be attack our ally and interest nato must respond and be proud that the uk be lead among european ally through our defence reform and our commitment verifiable against nato rule our billion cash boost for defence from flat cash baseline and our additional package of support for ukraine as putin lay waste to his military and recklessly expose his strength and weakness to general view we watch we learn and we act our defence reform be make our industrial base strong our investment in our conventional force stockpile and innovation make we more capable and more lethal our investment in our alliance be make we and our friend more secure our investment in our independent nuclear capability will always make adversary back off finish by pay tribute to the man and woman of our armed force they be the good of we and as we enter new age of high tech warfare we need to remember that day in day out it be our people and those who support they who put the great in great britain on that at least hope we can all agree question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider defence
