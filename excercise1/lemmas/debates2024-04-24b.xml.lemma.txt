what implication do that have for the way that devolve government conduct itself go forward thank the right hon gentleman for his question because there be genuinely interesting point about the growth in the number of people who live in northern ireland who declare themselves to be northern irish would like to think that it be reflect in the way that the first minister and the deputy first minister go about their business they be work together in respectful and positive way respectful of each other community and want the good for the place they represent believe that signify healthy development for the future of northern ireland politic call the shadow secretary of state thank you speaker for your eloquent tribute to frank field he be brave and generous man we look forward to work with the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson in his new position the uk successful bid to host the euros with ireland be fantastic opportunity for northern ireland but with just three year leave to build the casement park stadium the executive have yet to invite tender in may last year the secretary of state be ask who would provide the money and he reply all partner guarantee it give that the clock be tick how and when do the right hon gentleman intend with other to honour that guarantee so that the stadium get build on time the right hon gentleman know that he be ask that question of someone who have be football referee for the last year and who be rather passionate about the game really want to see these euro game play at casement park and have make that clear but the late cost that have see be significantly high than the one see year ago and any taxpayer contribution to the casement park project will need to be make on value for money basis have also say many time that there be no blank cheque here especially when there be no contractor appoint yet we do not want to artificially inflate price the northern ireland executive will also need to decide on whether and how they will underwrite any future increase in cost as say back then all partner be work together to try to work out what the number be and how we can deliver on it be grateful to the secretary of state for that reply one other challenge that the institution face be deal with the continue legacy of the trouble seven day from now all civil case and inquest relate to the trouble will come to an end under the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act which be widely oppose in northern ireland do the right hon gentleman think that confidence in the new independent commission will be help or hinder by the fact that it have recently bring three separate legal challenge to the disclosure by coroner of information to family about what happen to their love one information that they have be deny for so many year the right hon gentleman conflate two issue first there be the ongoing element of how we deal with public interest immunity and the neither confirm nor deny policy in court case in northern ireland and indeed across the united kingdom secondly there be the question about the new commission we be set up to deal with legacy believe that even those with civil case will be able to use the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery in good faith when it open its door on may only this month the former co chair of the consultative group on the past denis bradley say that he think the people involve with the icrir be very good people have lot of regard for they and if people decide it offer they something well then will be very reluctant to make too many strong judgment around it because this be the problem that the uk government be try to solve we have create swamp around legacy complete swamp anything that help some people to get out of that swamp will be too critical call the snp spokesperson add my party tribute to frank field we send our condolence to his friend and family he be birkenhead mp for year and he be very faithful servant not only to his constituent but to this place the return of devolved government to northern ireland have be rightly welcome across this house will the secretary of state reaffirm his

need whether that happen to be inside or outside the united kingdom welcome the hon gentleman welcoming of the restore institution be also great respecter of referendum result and believe we have one in scotland that be probably enough say integrated education northern ireland what recent discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on the expansion of integrated education in northern ireland the government remain committed to support integrate education in northern ireland and have already make fund available to support more school than ever to convert to integrated status and my noble friend lord caine look forward to engage with the new education minister paul givan to make progress on this important issue travel with colleague to northern ireland two week ago and we visit forge integrated primary school and meet lot of very fine child in million of fresh start funding be earmark for integrated education in northern ireland what do the minister say to those school that be expect this funding but have find that it be no long guarantee the house may not know that only of schoolchildren in northern ireland can be say to be attend an integrated school which we would like to see change the period over which fresh start funding be release would have end at the end of march so we have repurpose million of that funding to provide additional flexibility to the northern ireland executive in respect of that funding stream and school we be determined to see more parent give the opportunity to choose integrated education for their child as vital part of the process of reconciliation for one be especially committed to it as someone who proudly attend baptist church where for many year worship with roman catholic lady and have no idea we should help northern ireland move to point where denomination be small matter and where people move forward together an important item in the in tray of the newly re form executive be early year education and childcare thank to the action of this government we now have more generous entitlement to free childcare in england and northern ireland will he discuss with the executive how northern ireland might be level up on childcare include by use revenue raise measure my right hon friend be absolutely right to raise this issue and be grateful to she for put it on the agenda certainly we will engage with

with building answer their need for extra capacity the school be disappoint that the plan have be shelve along with project at nine other integrate school education be devolve but money have be

too indicate assent repeat that we have repurpose the money so that it can endure and be available to the executive to be use for purpose as they decide if we have not repurpose it the money would have expire at the end of march next year be proud that we have take the step necessary with the treasury to enable that money to continue to be available to the executive it be for they to decide how to spend it but we continue to be fully commit to integrated education programme for government northern ireland what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on the development of programme for government meet the first minister and the deputy first minister last week we have constructive discussion about the executive priority the public relief at the restoration of the

of tunstall do the deputy prime minister agree that stoke on trent order it be normally mr gullis who be loud please let hear he this just go to show the disdain that the labour party have for stoke

arrangement but the public want to know what this government will do about theirs natalie from brighton have be serve with two no fault eviction notice in month she join nearly million family at risk of homelessness due to the deputy prime minister failure to ban this cruel practice instead of obsess over my house when will he get grip and show the same obsession with end no fault eviction to begin with it be pleasure to have another exchange with the right hon lady in this house our fifth in month any more of these and she will be claim it as her principal residence on the issue of no fault eviction it may have escape the right hon lady attention but we will be vote on exactly that matter later today this be the conservative government take action the deputy prime minister clearly think that he could spend all week obsess over my live arrangement and do not even bother to read up on his own government bill this afternoon the reality be that he cave in to vested interest on his back benches and delay justice for people like natalie this week the housing minister say that there be no solid date for ban no fault eviction the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities now say that it will not happen before an election if the deputy prime minister can give we date will he name it now can name the date for the right hon lady today it be today that the house will vote on it and be confident that in line with our manifesto we will deliver on that commitment the deputy prime minister clearly have not be look up his own government bills let turn to another tory housing failure leasehold be rip off and con but the government propose ban on new leasehold apply only to house the majority of leasehold be in flat what be the point of ban on new leasehold if it will not apply to flat again the right hon lady be talk about legislation introduce by this government that the labour party totally fail to introduce in its entire time in office it be no surprise because it be this government who have bring social housing waiting list down by nearly half million and deliver more affordable home in the last year than labour deliver when it be in office of course all this can only be pay for by ensure that we have strong economy her policy to repeal every single conservative trade union law in the first day would open the door to french style wildcat strike sweep away the reform that make this country great we all know though the one reform by margaret thatcher that the right hon lady would not abolish the right to buy your council house be expect little bit well from the deputy prime minister he seem to be bit worn out maybe it be the am call from the bad man that have be keep he up at night he talk about strike and the union we have have more strike under this government watch than at any time before once again he have not read his own bill their ban on leasehold will not apply to the majority of people it be like ban non dom but exempt tory prime ministers he speak about affordable home family be trap in temporary accommodation and stick on waiting list and in the west midland the conservative mayor have use his multi million pound housing budget to build just social home in eight year that be almost as many as in the chancellor property portfolio the british people know that the conservative party will not build the home that this country need so when will they get chance to vote for government who will be surprised that the right hon lady raise the west midland when labour control birmingham have virtually bankrupt the council and be hike up council tax by while in the meantime be sure that this would please she continue to hand out million to the trade union by contrast andy street our brilliant mayor of the wide west midland have deliver billion of investment to improve transport there you have it the contrast between the conservative party and the labour party and the usual political opportunism from she fail to ask about the issue that really matter if you want more bin collection more pothole fill low debt and low council tax vote conservative because whether it be ben houchen in the tees valley or andy street in the west midland it be only the conservative mayors who deliver more for less it be pretty revealing that the deputy prime minister think that housing be not an issue for the british people think it really be people in glass house should not throw stone because in birmingham and across the whole country council be face black hole because of his government austerity programme warn the deputy prime minister that tory council have also face section notice and birmingham city council have have over billion take from its budget from some of the poor people more than family face lose their home after the tory party mini budget and mortgage bill continue to soar meanwhile the former prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss parade around the world in twisted victory lap promote her new book say that the mini budget be her proud moment since she will not apologise to those family lose their home will he what the prime minister have do since he have take office with the chancellor be to restore stability to our economy with inflation halve and more down to as result of that in an increasingly dangerous world the prime minister be able to announce his plan for the big strengthening of defence spending in generation but it should come as no surprise that the labour party refuse to say whether it back that because this come from the right hon lady who vote to scrap trident and to install in downing street someone who want to change the army into peace corps there you have it the right hon gentleman talk about defence we all want to see the difference be that we have not cut the army to its small size since napoleon never mind some secretive deep state it be the state of the tory party that be the problem the tories be in deep state of sewage after year they have fail renter they have fail leaseholder and they have fail mortgage holder read with interest that the right hon gentleman have be urge his neighbour in no to call an election because he be worried they might get wipe out have he finally realise that when he stab boris johnson in the back to get his mate into no he be ditch their big election winner for pint sized loser think the whole house will have hear despite all the bluster from the right hon lady not single word on whether she would actually back our plan to invest in our armed force no plan in dangerous world of course as ever the deputy labour leader be always look to attack other failure but never one to take responsibility for her own she once say you should be wait for the police to bang on your door if you do it then you should be do your job the right hon landlady should forget her tax advice and follow her own advice level up which my hon friend the member for stoke on trent north jonathan gullis mention early be absolutely on fire in the calder valley with million for hospital reconfiguration million for flood defence no few than school be remodelled or rebuild as we speak million for the regeneration of three town centre and elland get new railway station do my right hon friend agree that the naysayer around level up need look no far than the calder valley to see the great achievement of this government my right hon friend be right it be not just in the calder valley but in community up and down the country the government be invest billion in infrastructure across the united kingdom create job and opportunity in every region know that he have be staunch advocate for the calder valley which be fantastic example of that in action call the deputy leader of the scottish national party join in wish the jewish community happy passover and send my condolence to the family and love one of frank field two year ago when mass graf be discover in ukraine this house unite in condemnation and rightly treat those graf as evidence of war crime which russia must be make to answer for yesterday palestinian official uncover two mass graf outside the bomb hospital in gaza those graf also constitute war crime do they not of course we would expect the democratic government of israel to investigate any allegation of misconduct that be exactly what they be do and it be exactly what the foreign secretary and the prime minister urge they to do however find it quite extraordinary that the hon lady seek to draw parallel between the legitimate war of self defence of israel and the conduct of russia three hundred body include of the elderly and the injure some of which have be strip naked and mutilate with their hand tie behind their back the uk own arm policy state that if there be even risk that war crime may be take place that be reason enough to halt the sale of arm give all that we know why be the prime minister yet to do so we continue to urge the israeli government to investigate any allegation of misconduct the difference though be that we can trust the israeli government democratically elect government to properly investigate those thing of course we keep the advice under review the foreign secretary have recently make it clear that he have conduct determination and have not change his advice regard export licence and think that be the correct decision the good people of lincoln who all declare their taxis and pay tax on profit when sell their second home overwhelmingly want lincoln christmas market to be bring back after the labour run city council cruelly close it last year the labour city council have refuse to do what the people of lincoln want what message do the deputy prime minister send to the voter of lincoln before next week local election be afraid that what my hon friend have describe be the grinch in action that christmas market in the home of magna carta be belove by local resident but the council have totally ignore their wish and cancel it it should reverse that decision on behalf of the liberal democrats offer our condolence to the friend and family of the late lord frank field and wish happy passover to all those in the jewish community unpaid carer have share heartbreaking story of how they have be hound by the department for work and pensions and tell to pay huge fine for minor infringement of carer allowance earn rule all because the government have fail to do anything about problem that they have know about for year yesterday one of the prime minister own dementia adviser resign say that the government treatment of those unpaid carer be beyond the pale will the deputy prime minister apologise to all unpaid carer who have be fail by his government and will he commit to full review of the system pay tribute to all unpaid carer indeed meet some of they over the weekend and know how hard they work they keep our society function through their commitment to we that be why we have uprate the benefit by week and have increase the carer allowance by almost since in respect of allegation of overpayment of course appropriate discretion should be show but if there have be erroneous overpayment it be right on behalf of the taxpayer to be able to recuperate they however we will work with anyone who be struggle with those repayment to negotiate sustainable and affordable repayment plan my island constituency of ynys môn be access via two bridge the menai suspension bridge and the britannia bridge holyhead be the second busy port in the uk but bridge repair and the weather can result in long traffic queue to make the most of our anglesey freeport and new nuclear at wylfa third crossing be vital last year the welsh labour government scrap plan for all new road project include our third bridge will the deputy prime minister use his influence to ensure that north wales be not ignore by cardiff and that we get that third bridge know and understand the frustration across wales particularly in my hon friend constituency about this state of affair the welsh government have not prioritise build new road they be damage growth potential in place such as anglesey and be spend million on new politician we will work with she to ensure that we resolve the matter the conservative candidate for london mayor have promote islamophobic trope online endorse the belief of enoch powell and claim that the black community have problem with crime in the week when we mark the anniversary of the murder of stephen lawrence do the deputy prime minister really endorse those view think the hon lady know that she do not correctly represent the view of the candidate find it extraordinary that she have raise the issue of crime because while labour london mayor have increase the precept by over record crime in london have increase by that be the record of the labour london mayor no wonder people will be vote against he note that be the chair of the all party parliamentary group on fishery and thank the government for the recent pollack catch compensation on may we will see the first ever national fishing remembrance day will be mark the occasion by lay wreath at service hold at looe quayside by the memorial plaque that have the name of my late husband and unfortunately other on it will the deputy prime minister mark the occasion by remember those who have die bring this important food source to our table and will he ask the prime minister to do so know how important this matter be to my hon friend be sure she will be remember her late husband neil on that day it be important that we all recognise the sacrifice make by fisherman and woman to bring food to our table and know that my colleague the minister for food farming and fisheries my right hon friend the member for sherwood sir mark spencer will be visit grimsby on that day in today boro chairman steve gibson describe the mayor of tees valley as have give away the future of the region child he be refer to the of teesworks with forecast worth of million gift by lord houchen in deal to two local business mate mr gibson who help establish the local development corporation describe that deal as unforgiveable will the government finally admit that lord houchen and the conservatives have sell teesside taxpayer down the river the hon gentleman talk about teesside taxpayer but ben houchen have never impose mayoral precept in tees valley full stop at the same time he have save teesside airport and secure new freeport for teesside no wonder people will be vote for he again have my right hon friend see the video that be do the round of the theft in shop in my constituency boots the chemist on station road in the space of eight minute two threaten individual rob thousand of pound out of that shop and they be not alone it be happen again and again in fact one of my team go out and photograph they leave brazenly not care and even spit at the police will my right hon friend please now say to the home secretary and through he to the police that this be not petty crime this be threat of violence and massive robbery and it should be priority for the police we always talk about more police surely what we should be ask for be more effective policing that get those criminal off the street my right hon friend be absolutely right to highlight this issue often the allegedly low level crime be the one that have the big impact on community know that my right hon friend the home secretary have be very clear on that point and will make it to he again that be also why we be roll out range of crime prevention measure through the safe street fund it be why we be improve cctv and street lighting and it be why we introduce the police crime sentencing and courts act to give the police great power to deliver tough sentence for more serious offender early the deputy prime minister say that when the prime minister and the chancellor take office they restore stability to the uk economy who do he think cause the instability labour members might want to forget it but remember the day the conservatives come into office in what be the note leave on the desk of the chief secretary to the treasury there be no money leave that be the challenge that we have address through the prime minister and chancellor successively labour mayoral candidate in the west midlands talk about housing but make no commitment to protect our precious green belt he talk about transport but he fail to commit to reopen aldridge train station he commit to save police station such as aldridge then when the labour police and crime commissioner say he would close they he change his mind and agree to that so we be leave wonder in my constituency what he stand for do my right hon friend agree with that only mayor andy street have plan and track record to be trust to deliver for the west midland as ever my right hon friend be absolutely correct to highlight the record of labour police and crime commissioner and west midlands police have actually be put in special measure on simon foster watch when it come to the green belt we have all see the new wheeze from the labour party redesignate green belt grey belt and concrete all over it well the conservatives will not allow that to happen and people up and down the country will vote conservative to stop that happen conservative ministers like to blame strike and the pandemic for the appalling waiting time in the nhs the blackpool teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust have not hit its target for see patient in within four hour since before the strike and before the pandemic but five year after the conservatives come to office so who do the deputy prime minister blame for that labour member like to pretend the pandemic do not happen and they that be the cause of the big pressure on the nhs they complain about nhs performance while back strike by doctor who unreasonably want pay rise despite all of those pressure actually performance have improve in the past month the labour leader of the almost bankrupt hastings borough council and several other labour councillor resign from the labour party cite that the national labour party have become overly authoritarian in dereliction of local democracy and have lose its moral compass and be suffocate local voice because its only objective be power for power sake would the deputy prime minister agree that vote for conservative candidate in upcoming election will ensure local voter be hear local democracy be uphold and well service be deliver my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the really serious concern about labour councillor in hastings one former labour councillor say that labour be no long provide the policy the support or the focus on local government could not have put it well myself with thousand of steelworker job on the line the likelihood of industrial action and report of deal for india to be exempt from carbon taxis will this government now back the detailed serious and robust multi union proposal as the only way to keep primary steel making in the uk the government will engage with any proposal that have be bring forward as we always do but it be actually the case that we have already provide over million in energy cost relief to the steel sector in the past year it be also the case that even in the past year the government spend million more on uk make steel for major public project so we be continue to work with the steel industry but we have already provide tremendous support very much associate myself with the remark of my right hon friend regard lord frank field who be good man very much welcome the government firm commitment to increase defence spending to by it be something that will send the right message to our ally and potential adversary alike and it be something on which the defence committee have be campaign for little while however would my right hon friend do what he can to ensure that some of that increase money be spend on additional recruitment include if necessary increase wage sufficiently to ensure that the navy can manage ship the air force can maintain its aircraft and the army can dominate ground know what staunch advocate my hon friend be for the armed force and for fund the armed force all of we can take great pride that we be put the resource in to meet the challenge that the nation be likely to face over the next five year we will be work through the allocation of that but it be already the case that in january we have the large ever number of application in recent year to join the armed force so we be make progress on that my constituent lisa care for her mother she work part time at whsmith and be sure to keep the department for work and pensions inform so that she would not be overpay carer allowance however because of dwp blunder she now face bill for the secretary of state for science innovation and technology care for her career she work part time as woke detector however when she blunder call top scientist hamas supporter the bill ten of thousand of pound in cost and damage be pick up by taxpayer like lisa why it be this government who have uprated benefit for carer with almost more think it be the case that the hon lady constituent my constituent and people up and down the country would expect the government to seek to recover overpay sum we need to do that in compassionate way and if people be struggle to make repayment the dwp will engage to ensure that they have sustainable and affordable way to make those repayment may associate myself with the tribute and condolence pay to the late great frank field one of his last achievement in the world of education be the holiday activity and food fund which this government can take great pride in have fund may urge my right hon friend to use his good office across government to ensure that we secure multi year settlement for the continuance of that vital work know what an important piece of work this be and know my hon friend commitment to campaign for it we have already provide substantial sum and be sure we will continue to do so as the chair of the scottish arm of feeding britain may thank you mr speaker and those on the front benches for their tribute to the great frank field he chair an all party parliamentary inquiry year ago on food poverty and food bank use have increase relentlessly since then will the government consider in frank field memory cross sector summit with the aim of help community to secure the resource to deliver food security programme at the necessary scale join the hon gentleman in pay tribute to lord frank field campaigning it be the case that over the past couple of year we have provide more than billion worth of support with the cost of living include extra cost of live payment of last year the effect of all that be that million few people be live in absolute poverty than when the conservatives come to office last week we have the finance bill and in it notice reduction in capital gain tax from to on residential property to try to turbo boost the residential market will that apply retrospectively so that hypothetically if labour front bencher owe capital gain tax they would benefit from this conservative tax cut have always believe in have low taxis that everyone pay this week mark the fifth lesbian visibility week found by my good friend and publisher of magazine linda riley it come at time when lgbtqia woman be be let down by this government and nowhere more so than in their failure to remove the financial burden that same sex couple face when access ivf my constituent holly and leanne like so many other have be price out of have family so will the deputy prime minister commit to finally end this gay tax for same sex couple who want to start family would dispute the hon lady characterisation of the government record in this area it be this government who introduce marriage for same sex couple and pass the ture law she raise an important point that be happy to take up the health secretary but the overall record of this government be an excellent one defence spending with permission mr speaker shall make statement update the house on the government commitment to increase defence spending to this decade in my speech at lancaster house in january warn that we be enter much more dangerous period in the world and make the case for national conversation about defence spending since then putin have step up his attack on ukraine china be increasingly assertive and tension have escalate in the middle east culminate in iran unprecedented attack on israel day ago conduct in parallel with the proxy iran have nourish around israel border in the middle east include of course the houthis who continue to hold global trade hostage in the red sea since january the world have become even more dangerous not less and we continue to ask more of our courageous and professional armed force our sailor have serve under constant risk of attack in the red sea help to protect international shipping and our own cost of living we have bolster our royal air force presence in the middle east enable typhoon crew to intercept iranian drone and missile recently fire towards israel and around of our personnel from all three of our service with huge inventory of naval air and land asset have be active around europe as part of the large nato training exercise since the cold war in short we increasingly need our armed force and we increasingly be ask more of they so yesterday the prime minister commit to hit spend of gdp for defence by it mean we will invest an additional billion into defence over the next six year and that will be fund in full without any increase in either borrowing or debt this represent the big strengthening of our national defence in generation and as the nato secretary general say yesterday it will ensure the uk remain by far the large european defence spender in nato and it mean we be the second big nato spender overall it will provide very significant boost for uk defence science innovation and manufacturing it will make our defence industry more resilient and big and it will mean we be able to restock some of the global supply require in order to continue to ensure that we be both able to provide our own armed force and those in ukraine and be competitive export sector we also recognise the important role defence play in our national resilience by develop new plan that for the first time bring together the civil and military planning for how we would respond to the most severe risk that our country face our additional billion on defence be also enable we to ramp up that support for ukraine member on both side of the house will share the government concern about the warning president zelensky have be issue and his most senior general have confirm that their the ability to match russian force be increasingly difficult so as nato partner we be look at each other to see that leadership the uk government have step forward we be provide the alliance with the decisive leadership demand in this knife edge moment of this existential war this week we have commit an extra million of military aid to ukraine for this year bring our total package to billion in fact our total since putin full scale invasion be now more than billion billion of which be in military aid in addition we have provide nato partner with leadership by delve even deep into our own military inventory to give ukraine our large package of equipment and support to date the support announce this week include million of round of ammunition key munition include air defence and precision long range missile over armoured protect and all terrain vehicle support with logistic to support and bolster the frontline support to get the pilot who have train in the uk into the air as soon as possible and further boat to help ukraine strengthen its remarkable grip over the black sea include offshore raid craft and dive boat our billion defence investment will help ukraine get back on to the front foot couple with the reform that we have introduce to make procurement fast and more effective it will put our defence industrial base on war footing it will fire up the uk defence industry with an additional billion over the next decade for munition production that will bring our total spend on munition to about billion over the same period we be deliver for those who serve to guarantee our freedom as well with over billion to be invest in upgrade accommodation to build new living quarter for our personnel over the next decade we be also work seamlessly with key ally to strengthen our collective deterrence and develop new innovative capability just last month be in australia with our australian and us partner to advance our aukus programme which will develop and deliver range of cut edge kit in addition to the next generation of nuclear power submarine at the end of last year be in japan to advance our global combat air programme which be the development of the sixth generation fighter jet with italy and japan just last week be in telford to see the first fully british tank for year come off the production line that be just one strand of our future soldier programme to make our army more integrated and much more lethal of course defence already support hundred of thousand of job with real quality to they in the uk include over directly in the industry our additional billion will open up many more opportunity in region up and down the country this be turning point in uk defence we must spend more because defence of the realm be the first duty of every government we on the government side of the house recognise that fact but while want to see peace and international order be restore be also absolutely convinced that it be hopeful thinking even complacency to imagine that we can do that without ensure that we be well protect the good way of keep country safe and protect our way of life be deterrence be prepare be clear eyed about the threat we face be clear about our capability back uk defence science technology and innovation carry not just big stick but the most advanced and capable stick that we can possibly develop and yes use our military muscle alongside our ally our investment in our continuous at sea nuclear deterrent make would be adversary think twice we on the government side of the house have not come to the conclusion that our nation nuclear deterrent be there because an election be approach we have always believe in our nuclear deterrent this be an additional billion boost for our force in the build up to the nato summit in washington will do all can to get alliance member to follow our lead and bolster their armed force strengthen their industrial base invest in innovation maximise their military deterrence and most importantly of all maximise their support for ukraine in more dangerous world where we face an axis of authoritarian state must become the new baseline for the entire alliance if we be to deter lead and defend that be what be require of we commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for the advance copy of his statement there be much to welcome in it and more widely today with the us congress finally pass the bill for more military aid to ukraine and the prime minister finally make multi year commitment to uk military aid beyond this year we face much more dangerous world british force be in action defend international shipping in the red sea reinforce nato ally on the russian border and protect we all they be respect worldwide for their total professionalism they require our support from all side of this house we welcome the new commitment on funding for ukraine and to build up stockpile to boost defence export to prioritise domestic defence production and to set up new strategic headquarters in the mod all plan have argue for in this post the secretary of state be right to say that the first duty of any government be to defend the country and keep its citizen safe labour will always do what be require and spend what be require on defence the last time the uk do spend of gdp on defence be in under labour never match in any one of the tory year since two week ago the labour leader say that we want fully fund plan for of gdp on defence we share the same ambition as the government because we must do more to deal with the grow threat we want it to be fully cost and fully fund and set out in the government baseline budget this target be not it be in press release why be the plan not in last month budget or any of the other five budgets and autumn statement since the government first promise to spend by two year ago none hit none reverse the real cut in day to day defence spending none match labour record in government if this plan have be in budget it would have be independently check openly cost and fully fund where be the additional money come from how much be come from which other research and development budget how much be come from cut how many civil servant and in which department the government have try this trick before in the defence review minister pledge to cut of mod civil servant in order to make their defence spending plan add up civil servant number do not go down instead of go down to they go up to the secretary of state mention an additional billion five time in his statement over the next six year the government official spending plan be base on real annual growth in core defence spending why have he invent his own zero growth baseline to produce this fake figure claim an extra billion for defence the public will judge ministers by what they do not what they say over year they have hollow out our armed force they have cut the army to its small size since napoleon they have miss their own recruitment target each and every year they have allow morale to fall to record low and they have waste at least billion on mismanage defence procurement everyone recognise that defence spending must rise to deal with increase threat the opposition have no access to classified threat assessment or military advice so if we be elect to government we will conduct strategic defence review within our first year to get to grip with the threat we face the capability we need the state of the armed force and the resource available when we get to open the book that be how labour will manage the requirement for strong national security and the responsibility for sound public finance the defence secretary clearly like labour plan for defence because so much of they be now government policy but there be still no tory plan to reinforce homeland protection with new strategic review to fulfil nato obligation in full with nato test on our major programme to renew the nation contract with those who serve with an independent force commissioner and to make ally our strategic strength with new eu french or german defence agreement with threat increase and tension grow we must make britain well defend with labour britain will be well defend let start on the area that agree with the right hon gentleman mention how much we welcome the us congress put billion into the defence of ukraine we warmly welcome that as churchill be repute to have say america usually get on and do the right thing when it have exhaust all other alternative it take long time but we have get to the point where that money will go to ukraine that be very welcome across the house the right hon gentleman say that he welcome today announcement but then spend all his time explain or rather avoid explain why labour be not back which have schedule timescale and figure that have be publish and be in the document produce yesterday and lay in the library he say judge we by our action not our word we will because member of the opposition front bench team vote against trident it be no good for he and the leader of the opposition to go up to barrow and to claim that they be all in favour of the nuclear defence because they stand on platform with leader who want to scrap trident pull we out of nato and turn the army into peace corps the opposition tell we judge we on our action where be the shadow foreign secretary who vote against trident where be the shadow deputy prime minister and the shadow communities secretary who vote against trident neither be there on the front bench presumably neither be in full agreement with the right hon gentleman when it come to the defence of the realm and defend this country the conservative party have always believe in our nuclear deterrent we be upgrade it and make sure it be fit for purpose neither support the as the house will have note it be fine for the right hon gentleman to come to the dispatch box and talk about yet another review if the problem be have defence review there would be no issue at all the last thing this country and armed force require be yet another review delay disruption and obfuscation call the chair of the defence committee my right hon friend be right to say that we be continually ask more of our armed force as the defence committee recent report make clear in that context greatly welcome the announcement and the increase investment we want it to unleash triple whammy in which our industrial partner also seize the opportunity to invest heavily in capital equipment and and in which our nato ally see this as new benchmark to which those who do not already can aspire and meet what be we do to ensure that we not only make the investment but achieve that triple whammy my right hon friend the chair of the defence committee be absolutely right on the investment point speak to my opposite number us defence secretary lloyd austin yesterday evening about how it will help to galvanise nato in particular to make great investment when we go to the nato summit in washington for the anniversary the new baseline will be rather than the one set by the uk in which or so of nato member have now reach that investment send very important signal to the whole defence industrial base that be why it be critical to set out the plan and stick to it and agree to reach by call the snp spokesperson the secretary of state clearly have herculean task to find billion so let we seek clarity on where it may be find welcome the investment if it be in capability agree with the shadow secretary of state on why it be not in the budget think we all know why it do not stand up to scrutiny let also welcome the secretary of state investment in ukraine on the back of the us commitment have to say to our us colleague that it be long overdue let ask some specific question it be the duty of opposition to challenge government and we will have our difference with no increase in borrowing or debt the implication be that there will be deep cut to other public service if the government have assume baseline with spend freeze in cash term as of gdp as think be allude to by the shadow defence secretary it come nowhere near billion as come from service family wonder if the secretary of state will commit to direct increase in spend on accommodation training and recruitment as part of this proposal give that we be at near napoleonic decline on the frontline and have push member of the armed force into food bank and near penury the secretary of state and will of course disagree on the nuclear deterrent but wonder if he will answer one specific point while he retain it the nuclear enterprise have be expose as unaffordable in the late report by the national audit office what assurance can he give the house that the nuclear deterrent will not continue to cannibalise the ministry of defence budget and specifically the billion he have propose today the first thing should point out be that page in the annex of the document before the house describe the uplift in the defence budget we have headline it as billion in fact when we go through and add up the individual amount year on year it reach billion of expenditure member can see there exactly how we will get to it secondly it be fully fund know the labour party do not like the idea but we will remove civil servant from the system not because we do not think they be good people fortunately with low unemployment we know they will be gainfully employ elsewhere but because we want to get back to the size of the civil service we have before covid before it expand greatly we see no reason to continue to run civil service with additional people each year when that money could go into the defence of the realm the hon gentleman ask about our commitment to our armed force personnel their family and their accommodation he may have miss it in my statement but mention billion that we will now invest in their accommodation and condition over this period thank to this big uplift he will be aware that last year there be lot of problem with leak and boiler not be fix for considerable period of time there have not be those story this year because we get on top of that with million and by make sure that contractor be do their job as the hon gentleman rightly say we have our difference on thing like nuclear deterrence but if there be one thing that benefit scotland in particular would suggest it be what go on at faslane with the extraordinary high quality job it produce and the proud part it play in this nation defence call the chair of the intelligence and security committee the main reason why this welcome uplift have come when it have be russia aggression against ukraine do the secretary of state agree that if russia and putin be see to fail in ukraine the threat to nato will be put back for at least generation conversely if they succeed the threat to nato will intensify will he therefore do everything he can to persuade our ally especially certain part of the united states new political establishment that the success of ukraine be essential for the peace of europe and indeed the peace of the world my right hon friend be absolutely right although this be billion and although it take our budget to of gdp that be fraction fraction of what it would cost if putin be successful in ukraine there be no chance he would stop there none other autocrat elsewhere would look at that and exploit the idea that all they have to do be outwait the west and we will get bored of it through some form of attention deficit and give up defend the thing we say we would never stop defend that in the end would cost we all huge amount more may first of all congratulate the secretary of state on his stellar use car salesman act which we have become use to on march he appear along with official before the defence committee his strategic finance director confirm that next year when we take ukraine funding out of the budget the defence budget fall can he tell the house how he reconcile that fact which be confirm by his own official with his claim today and the prime minister yesterday to be put the country on war footing be really sorry that the right hon gentleman cheapen what be very important discussion about the defence of the realm with such ridiculous remark we should all come here in the right spirit to discuss these important issue give the subject matter he ask about ukraine ukraine be part of what our armed force and this country be have to deal with we do not ask america to strip out its help to ukraine in the same way that we do not ask it to strip out its help to afghanistan or iraq because it be part of the core defence budget yesterday do not mention this in my statement and perhaps on this basis the right hon gentleman may be forgive we also say that our enhanced amount of money for ukraine be not now just for this year but we be go to carry on do it every single year into the future so yes it be part of our core expense commend the secretary of state for obtain this massive billion increase in defence which theoretically would allow we to buy new queen elizabeth class aircraft carrier at the risk of upset our excellent first sea lord we be not likely to do that but we be put our defence industry on war footing can we do the concomitant thing and create war reserve of equipment with old typhoons old warship and old armoured vehicle so that if we have to fight at short notice we would have enough equipment to do it and so that we can tell our adversary that when we say si vis pacem para bellum we actually mean it thank my right hon friend not just for his word but for his constant campaigning on this subject those of we who have be subject to he in select committee know that he know his fact know what he be talk about and have do as much as anybody to ensure that this uplift be happen can confirm for the house that we will not be use the billion for new aircraft carrier my right hon friend make an interesting point about what we could do with old equipment have to say to he that right now be much more minded to send that equipment to ukraine that be why yesterday pull together the big donation package to date in what be now the third year of the war of equipment to ukraine for the time be think we will be send it in an easterly direction can ask the secretary of state what he believe war foot be very simply ukraine have teach the world great deal about this when it come to for instance produce sufficient munition to restock the ukrainians supply it be very difficult in fact impossible to do that instantaneously when there be global competition for or other missile we want to ensure that our own industrial defence estate be able to produce such item by tell those in the industry that they be on war footing by put in billion more and critically name the date by which we will get there we will put they on that war footing commend my right hon friend for his stalwart stubbornness in secure this important increase in defence spending he and both know that much more money be need but this be step in the right direction he be off shortly to meet nato member and fear that he will have great deal of work to do for example only two nato member be prepared to open fire on the houthis in the strait of hormuz one of the major trade route for nato and the west do my right hon friend feel that there will be lot of work for he to do when he go to meet those nato member and ask they to step up and spend on defence as they should do and as we be go to do thank my hon and gallant friend for his comment he be right to point out the need to be prepared to use the ability that we have ours be one of the only country with both the global reach and the desire and preparedness to use those ability which be why we have end up defend ship in the red sea from the houthis can report that specific incident along those line have take place today with our armed force in action and we can be very proud of everything they do for we on behalf of the liberal democrats welcome the right hon gentleman statement about increase defence spending although it relate to time six year hence rather than be specific about funding in the intervene year eighteen of the member of nato be still not spend even of gdp on defence include france spain and italy encourage they to spend more be not so much about fairness as about persuade sceptic in the united states that north america should remain engaged in europe leverage at the nato summit in july will come too late what additional commitment do the secretary of state and other ministers obtain from our ally before announce the pledge first assure the hon gentleman that it start this year the half billion pound be in this year budget we have opt to give that money directly to ukraine in addition to the money that we be already gift it bring the total to billion secondly let gently say that do not think have ever hear liberal democrats argue for more defence spending but strongly welcome the hon gentleman to the cause agree with he entirely that we ourselves set back in be no long the baseline that we should be work to but gently point out to he that the reason it have take some time to replace trident and in particular the submarine be that there be short period under the coalition when we could not get our liberal democrat partner to agree to get on with the job may in pass pay tribute to the late frank field he vote for the renewal of trident unlike many on the labour front bench and he would have understand that deepen our defence capability in the conventional force be vital part of the deterrence that nato provide for the security of europe commend my right hon friend and the government for lead the way on this and set an example through leadership thank my hon friend and add my condolence to those already convey by other frank field be great statesman with really innovative idea about welfare reform which it take this government to enact and he be great loss to we all entirely agree with my hon friend about our leadership in nato in get to be talk about that to the secretary general of nato yesterday we must ensure that be the new level at which people operate if they do if everyone join we at would be billion per annum more in the collective nato budget which would make huge difference labour be absolutely committed to reach and we welcome the additional million for ukraine but time be of the essence what be the secretary of state do to speed up the delivery of much need military supply to the frontline in ukraine warmly welcome the hon lady comment and hope very much that those on her front bench who have not attach themselves to the timeline that she urge have listen closely to what she have say as for the delivery of item to the frontline we will be very fast we will deliver in matter of day or week quite lot of the item outline in the very extensive package announce yesterday although they come in number of different form and some by their physical nature will take long to deliver than other welcome the announcement and indeed the decision that have finally be make in the united states can my right hon friend confirm that investment will go into not just technology but the logistic the warehousing and the background facility here in the uk such as those at mod longtown very important employer for my constituency to ensure that our frontline force be supply with the good kit that they could possibly have my right hon friend can certainly have that reassurance we know that such support be extraordinarily important to the running of truly lethal and effective armed force in every year since the government along with their liberal democrat partner have miss recruitment target and the times have warn that army number could fall to full time equivalent what be the defence secretary do to ensure that those who wish to serve and defend our country be not put off by the broken recruitment system the hon lady will be pleased to hear that in january and february we have an eight year high in the number of application for the army which be reflect in the other service agree that we need to be much more effective in get application all the way through the system it take too long and the procedure be too disparate people be have to turn up for an initial interview go away and then come back for medical why not do all those thing at once however other measure be really help there have be pay increase of nearly for the less well pay member of the armed force in the last year which have help with recruitment and people see our armed force involve in so much action have also help the minister for defence people and families be spend great deal of time ensure that the many think in the haythornthwaite review be implement as quickly as possible join the many voice that have call for some time for an increase in defence spending and we welcome this announcement suspect that privately the defence secretary be hop that this day would come as well and congratulate he on the work that he have do behind the scene to ensure that this funding be secure state on state conflict have return in europe and the world be more dangerous more contested and more polarised will the defence secretary therefore expand little on the consequence to uk security and to the uk economy if russia win before rush in to spend these increase fund will he recognise the need to consider the full spectrum of threat and warfare that we face so that money be wisely spend my right hon and gallant friend have be very important part of ensure that we get to where we be today but have not realise that have be keep my own desire to reach this point quite so secret he be correct in say that the implication of russia win this war would be horrendous the cost of what this country have to put up with because of covid for example would seem small in comparison with the cost of what could happen if other autocratic state decide to take chunk of other people land that could have direct impact on our economy this be not in my view money that we be spend it be money that we be invest in our security to ensure that russia and other despotic leader like putin never think that they can try it on with we we will be invest it extremely wisely in many programme with which my right hon friend and other member on both side of the house be familiar as well as in innovative new area such as the dragonfire may thank the secretary of state for the urgent support for ukraine which be much need just now however the institute for fiscal studies point out that in the chancellor budget there be conspiracy of silence between the government and the labour party on follow the fiscal rule when it come to say where billion worth of cut to public service would come from today announcement add up to another billion of cut to public service can he explain where those cut will be make we have already lay out the fact that this plan be fully cost and fund as have mention to the house we have say that we will reduce the size of the civil service by that be not one off cut it be money that be not be pay each year and will help to fund defence there be also some other thing that the chancellor will no doubt wish to get into do not know whether the hon gentleman have take look at page and the annexe but he will see that this be all set out absolutely welcome this very important investment in defence as my right hon friend say the world be change place and be sure that he would agree that defence be indeed public service on the extra funding and the project that he have announce may ask he to make sure that he say to the treasury that the programme should be fully fund this should not just be capital investment the treasury have habit of say the capital investment be fine but let not worry about revenue the project will need revenue so will he make sure to have those conversation with the treasury my right hon friend make very clear point base on his experience of the department we have to make sure not just that we fund the capital but that we have the resource to run the equipment he raise very important matter and this budget enable we to ensure that this be do properly too welcome the increase to the world have definitely become more dangerous place over the last year can only suppose that the announcement be not make in last month budget because it would have come under scrutiny from the office for budget responsibility but could the defence secretary say exactly what proportion of the will be spend on cyber security and armed service personnel should point out to the house that we have always say that we would do this when condition allow inflation fall to last week down from over ten day ago we see iran fire hundred of missile at democratic state and we be partly involve in the collective defence it be therefore true to say that the world be show itself to be even more dangerous we have reach the point where we be see growth back in the economy and inflation fall so now be the right time to do this the hon lady ask about the sum of money that will go into for example cyber or space do not have those figure on would be very happy to write to she with an overview because it will take bit of collation to work that out exactly from the exist budget quite lot of what happen in strategic command which cover those area cross over into other part of the armed force so it be not simple question to answer this be very welcome statement so thank my right hon friend he mention the haythornthwaite report when will we get an update particularly on the plan to spend the million investment in service family accommodation very soon accept the need for additional defence spending but may ask the defence secretary for reassurance that the government strategy for uk and global security go forward will have an appropriate balance of hard and soft power by that mean ongoing investment in diplomacy humanitarian assistance international development potentially include the restoration of the target of spend of gross national income and indeed support for the international rule base order can certainly reassure the hon gentleman that that be something that we in the mod be always look to do we have just make our seventh or eighth drop of food aid into gaza use the raf we be work with the americans on other solution include the pier and work very closely with the foreign commonwealth and development office indeed use to be minister in the former department for international development so be well aware of the issue he raise the mod will always look to assist with our armed force wherever we can we often combine hard and soft power this have be good week for defence and commend the government on their commitment to but the issue be how we spend it could the defence secretary confirm to the house that rather than our focus on exquisite exclusivity or heaven forbid indulge single service bad behaviour the money will be spend on plug capability gap well operate the platform that we have and ensure that our force have the activity resilience and sustainment to maintain and enhance their world lead and persistent global posture that be an excellent question the minister for defence procurement have do an outstanding job on publication that recommend to everyone in the house integrated procurement model it be much more exciting than it sound that new model have already be responsible for bring forward the procurement of the dragonfire by five year rather than our try to create exquisite unbelievably complicated and never quite right equipment the model will bring equipment into the field and allow it to be spiral and develop far my hon friend be absolutely right we will use this money much more intelligently to make sure that we get kit into the field and expand and improve it from there while welcome the increase to the modus operandi of this secretary of state be to come to this house and announce billion of pound of investment to get people salivate about it only for it to never happen look at northern powerhouse rail and high speed we know it the country know it and the brass know it the times report that we will fall to below full time equivalent troop where will we be with boot on the ground in year time the way for this not to happen be for the public to vote for the hon gentleman party because have not hear this afternoon that the labour party be commit to make it happen if people want by they should vote conservative because that be what we will give they think will leave it there add my tribute to the late frank field who be an extraordinary man and great parliamentarian in welcome the announcement of an additional billion over the next six year which be much need may urge the secretary of state to consider the potential for fifth successor class submarine note that the patrol time for the vanguard class be approach day which be not sustainable and it be vital that we give ourselves as much operational capacity as we can with our deterrent we will always keep very close eye on how we ensure constant at sea nuclear deterrent can confirm that it have be at sea every single day for year and we do not intend to have that stretch break quite what that require be matter for defence study as my right hon friend know we be commit to deliver four dreadnought which will be far more modern like any modern piece of equipment they be likely to have great reliability as well we will not let this country down when it come to our nuclear deterrent as say in my statement we be not do this just because we be approach an election we have always believe in our nuclear deterrent and we always will even winston churchill recognise that modern conflict be fight by people not army that be why world war two be the genesis of the nhs and the welfare state however while military spending be increase public service be collapse be it not as important to wage war on poverty at home as it be to prepare for war abroad if there need to be an increase in military and defence expenditure surely it should come from the cancellation of the fail trident project which be impoverish military service rather than from public service why should the people pay for the government war could not disagree with the hon gentleman more strongly even in my time as defence secretary there be decision that have make that if we have not have the nuclear deterrent would have hesitate in make it protect we every single day in way that be not always immediately obvious to everyone the idea that by not invest in our defence we would somehow be safe and that somehow all that money would be available to invest in all these other public service be to misunderstand the first principle of every government we be here to defend the realm without which there would be nothing to pay for internally because we would not be safe externally in the wise government ensure that raf airfield be upgrade and improve and that save we from extinction in if we be to be on war footing will the secretary of state remind the home office that it be its duty to maintain the good runway in europe the ft runway at raf scampton instead of let it rot as it be at present if the home office be incapable of do that will it hand it over to scampton holdings as soon as possible as we have argue for month so that it can be use improve and available for future emergency my right hon friend be speak to the converted as keen pilot agree with he entirely in fact this usually work the other way around but will offer he meeting so that we can discuss raf scampton and its long term future rather than the short term in more detail come from naval family it be important to that labour be also want to reach our ambition be no less than that of the government the defence secretary have say that this defence spending increase will be fund in part by big cut in the number of civil servant how much of this cut will be in the mod civilian workforce and will the royal fleet auxiliary be exempt welcome the hon lady support for this package and for the and gently suggest that conversation with those on her own front bench would be important at this point it be in the interest of national security that both side sign up to by deadline which we note this afternoon have not happen she ask specific question about the reduction in the mod it would be reduction by to be clear that be reduction from about to personally believe that be exactly the right thing to do if it help to pay for our brave man and woman in the armed force out in the country less bureaucracy and more action think that be good thing thank the secretary of state for his recent visit to shropshire which he reference and also to welcome his statement and the statement of the prime minister yesterday this be record investment into uk defence which will be very welcome in shropshire would my right hon friend like to take this opportunity to put on record his thank to all those that work in uniform and the civilian at raf cosford at mod donnington at babcock and at rbsl rheinmetall bae systems land which he recently visit can he confirm that the uk and shropshire defence be secure with this government warmly join my right hon friend in send exactly that message as he say just last week be look at the first prototype of the challenger come off the production line in his patch my only regret be that be not able to see he at the same time my write question this week have uncover another worrying increase in nuclear safety event at nuclear weapon site in with the first category safety breach in year at faslane and the high number of category incident since category incident be define as those that have an actual or high potential for radioactive release to the environment in breach of safety limit former chief adviser to prime minister have describe our exist nuclear stock as rot and dangerous disaster can the secretary of state tell we how much of this extra spend will go towards ensure that at the very least exist nuclear site do not deteriorate far threaten the health and safety of armed force staff and surround population be pleased to report to the hon lady that our defence standard particularly when it come to our nuclear estate be extremely high whenever an issue be find it be properly and thoroughly investigate she be right to say that it be important that we continue to invest in that this money be good news every bit help and we want to ensure that it be spend appropriately as it happen we fund the nuclear estate appropriately but this money will help to ensure that be put well beyond doubt this be very welcome announcement there be no string attach and guarantee move to of gdp send powerful message to two group of people our nato partner and our adversary around the world do the secretary of state agree however that the powerful message be undermine by what can only describe as the mealy mouthed response from the labour liberal democrat and scot nat front benches if they will not support what we be do what sort of message do that send to putin and to other enemy surely what we want now be cross party consensus it must be and labour must side with we on it could not agree with my hon friend more may take this opportunity to pay tribute to the reservist base in croydon who among many role have be in estonia help to keep we all safe labour want to reach but my right hon friend the shadow defence secretary have ask why there be no budget line or fully fund plan for the announcement this appear to be bit of pattern across government only yesterday learn that billion announcement make about carbon capture and storage several year ago still appear nowhere on treasury budget line if the government play so fast and loose with our public funding how on earth will the secretary of state deliver the economic stability on which our defence spending rely encourage the hon lady and all opposition members to have close look at what we announce yesterday this be fully fund announcement we have explain where the money will come from we have set out in table that you can go and read madam deputy speaker the funding for the billion it be true that choice exist that labour front benchers need to talk not only to their back benchers about because they will not agree with increase to by but unfortunately to many on their front bench as well they will need to talk to in particular the one who have vote against trident some of whom want to leave our nuclear deterrent behind and possibly even leave nato as well conservative members be however entirely unite in the idea of spend set date for it now set out how that spending will work and make the choice to get there strongly welcome this investment which rightly recognise the increasingly unstable world in which we be operate many of our military capability be power by advanced semi conductor and recent year have show how fragile these supply chain can be will the secretary of state set out what the government be do to develop strong alliance focus on secure our supply of that vital component my hon friend be right as business secretary take the decision on newport wafer fab which highlight to the importance of our own supply chain for advanced semiconductor particularly in the defence realm that be one reason that in the plan we publish yesterday we have commit to new level of of for defence to ensure that we be not only research and develop but through the expansion of the military capability in the industrial base produce the thing that we need for our armed force labour want to reach do not know how many more labour member need to say that before it get through if anybody be listen my right hon friend the member for wentworth and dearne john healey the shadow secretary of state also say that clearly in his contribution the secretary of state say repeatedly on the medium round this morning and in the chamber that on page we can find the fully cost plan bear in mind that there be no mention on page of how the will be reach through the cut to the civil service that the secretary of state have describe and that the entire civil service budget be only billion where be the fully fund plan it be not on page the hon lady once again assert that labour want to reach labour can not just assert it it have to will the mean to get there do not hear that from the labour front bench in response to this statement or yesterday announcement as in all normal case and particularly spend review the treasury will set out all the number go forward but the fact of the matter be that the figure publish yesterday show billion more be spend from this year through to the end of the decade in part pay for by remove civil servant from the system so that we get back to where we be before covid if labour do not want to follow that approach it could follow another but the hon lady can not just assert that labour agree without explain how it will do it refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests also warmly welcome the increase of defence spending to of gdp and congratulate my right hon friend and the prime minister on the leadership role they be provide to nato on where this extra money will go will my right hon friend elaborate little more on the balance between meet the exist challenge in the equipment plan and introduce innovative new capability through the new procurement model that he commend to the house early we will both ensure that we deliver the thing that we have say we will deliver in change world with the threat of iran russia much more assertive china and nuclear armed north korea we be adjust our programme to ensure that it do what be require new innovation as my right hon friend will have gather from my comment about spend of gdp on be very important to we we can now see how in an asymmetric war russia entire black sea fleet have be make inoperative by ukrainian navy that have no fleet at all ghost fleet we need to consider how we do all that and this money will be use wisely in that context thank the secretary of state the prime minister and the government for their clear commitment to also thank they for commit an extra million of aid for ukraine which be important the secretary of state and the government be set target for the rest of nato to follow and hope it will very much welcome the news of an increase in defence spending which my party and have push for but how much of the increase will be foot on the ground and how much will be enhance cyber security we be stick with the defence review and refresh which set out the exact personnel number think it be across all three service have explain the extent to which new technology be help to shape our thinking but so be the lesson from ukraine particularly on the need to have munition and large stockpile available there be of course many excellent location include in northern ireland where more munition and missile be be create as we speak with about an eightfold expansion look forward to visit some of those who will enjoy the additional billion bring the total to about billion over the next few week rise order be anxious to ensure that all colleague get in but urge brief question so that the secretary of state can give brief answer thank you madam deputy speaker chair the defence committee and the secretary of state will know from prime minister question that the whole conservative party welcome this announcement but may suggest that the message from the government would carry so much great resonance globally if the official opposition also sign up to it be former member of the armed force so can assure he that the country speak as whole the official opposition and the government together carry much great weight internationally for the good of the country my hon and gallant friend be absolutely right we have see how that have work with ukraine and be sorry that it be not work today with the timeline to get to be afraid it prove once again that this country safety be in the right hand when conservative be in power echo the word of the secretary general of nato jens stoltenberg who say after yesterday defence spending announcement that once again the uk be lead by example in the light of the million support package for ukraine and have see the awful picture of missile attack on ukrainian city include the destruction of the tv tower in kharkiv in the past hour can my right hon friend confirm that the much need ammunition and missile system will be in ukraine as soon as possible to aid its fight against russian aggression my hon friend be absolutely right both about what the secretary general say about how we be lead nato in this regard and about the absolute importance of our be there for ukraine we can not afford for this war to be lose and it will not be lose will make sure that he receive the comprehensive list of the item that we will now be supply it be widely report some month ago that my right hon friend and the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have write to

that company in stroud will do very well from this if they be produce innovative and useful equipment for our armed force take on board her point about small and medium sized enterprise when be run my printing business and company pay late it would put huge pressure on cash flow one of the great thing that this government have do be speed up the necessity for large organisation particularly the

announcement show that it be our conservative government who will protect our nation and stand with our ally in the face of increase international threat will the secretary of state confirm that this sensible linear increase in funding for defence will help our defence industry to ramp up production in parallel mean that our armed force will be support capable and resilient and be able to keep we and our ally safe absolutely can confirm that one of the feature of the way that we have do this be to create straight line from next year to to ensure that industrial capacity can ramp up with certainty behind it be pleased to confirm that the answer be yes the chief of the defence staff from estonia be in salisbury plain in my constituency last week he tell we that his country have man and woman in its army reserve ready to serve at hour notice call that be on war footing give that estonia have population time small than our be not propose that we try to replicate that proportionally that would mean million strong reserve but will he consider use some of the money to boost our important reserve force my hon friend will know that we be twin with estonia through nato and we provide protection to it estonia be very much on the frontline with russia in way that we be fortunate not to be we currently have reserve rather than use they we can use the many other thing we bring to nato and to estonia protection include the ability to provide personnel and equipment which we do on regular basis commend my right hon friend on the work he have do in set the new baseline it will reassure our ally send an important message to our adversary and strengthen our industrial base thank he for the part he play in secure million for barrow as result of the team barrow project secure

other key site such as faslane devonport and other absolutely can confirm to he that it be intend to benefit site across the country in the document we publish yesterday map on page show how the different area and region of the country will benefit not just in our nuclear estate but throughout the defence estate there be not constituency that do not benefit from the billion announce yesterday my hon friend welcome the announcement and it be time for other to follow that lead add my own tribute to the late lord field he take the time to talk to when be conservative councillor about concern we share for the weak and most vulnerable in society which reach across the aisle of the house there be no doubt that the international threat be develop and the world be more dangerous place so welcome today statement what hear be an investment in the armed force that we need not necessarily the armed force we have do my right hon friend share my concern that the statement from the opposition that they be plan to conduct review be verge on the careless in that it give comfort only to those who seek to do the uk harm my hon friend be right about the armed force that we need not the armed force that we have we want our armed force to be lethal quick agile and capable which be why it be so important that we invest this billion he be also right to point out that to have yet another review be simply to invite chaos and delay at exactly the time our adversary be look at we hop that we do not get on with the job of deliver an extra of gdp in funding which would play into their hand thank the secretary of state for the announcement of in defence spending by will my right hon friend acknowledge the fantastic effort deliver by our reserve force which have the pleasure to

to be reservist we be grateful for all they do point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker the house have be receive information about the government ongoing arm export to israel about which the deputy prime minister speak early high court hearing on judicial review into arm export which finish yesterday provide lot of information that will say this politely be far from the impression we have be give by ministers about arm sale especially about how we have the most robust arm export licence in the world one such example be that although the government last review and approve arm sale to israel on april it appear that that do not consider the killing of three british aid worker in israeli air strike on gaza on april think we all find that shocking madam deputy speaker can you advise how we ensure the government be provide this house with up to date and accurate information and how we can well hold the government to account over this pressing and serious matter thank the hon gentleman for his point of order and for give notice of it think he will be interested to know that ministers be give evidence to the business and trade committee on this subject early today in view of that be sure that he will find way to ask ministers about any new information that may have come to light since they last answer question on this subject in the chamber should also say that the secretary of state for defence have stay to listen to his point of order and be sure that the treasury bench will feed back the point that he have make heritage public houses motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require local authority to maintain register of heritage public house in their area and to make provision in connection with the compilation and maintenance of such register to make provision relate to planning application in respect of public house on such register to place restriction on the sale of heritage public house to make provision relate to the nomination of heritage public house as asset of community value to make provision about the listing of heritage public house and for connected purpose stand before you today madam deputy speaker with call to action on august last year we learn of the devastating loss of cherished piece of my local community history the crooked house this beloved pub with its unique character and rich tapestry of story be senselessly destroy in what be see by most as the ruthless pursuit of profit over preservation the crooked house be not just pub over century it be gathering place sanctuary piece of our share heritage its wall hold countless memory and moment that define our life in the black country and far beyond build in the crooked house see the birth of the industrial revolution and the trial and tribulation of people who work our coalmine and our limestone mine and who work in our foundry make nail and all the chain and anchor of the ship that sail the seven sea these be long suffer people who just get on with the job while their live and working condition be truly appalling see the crooked house violently reduce to ash and rubble immediately tear profound wound that cut deep into the consciousness of people not just locally but nationally and in fact from all corner of the planet the destruction of the crooked house be not just tragedy but wake up call it expose disturbing trend where short sighted greed trump the preservation of our cultural heritage it vividly expose the shortcoming of our system and framework that should offer well protection to these treasured asset anybody who might push back at this assertion should perhaps explain why it be that across the country historic pub the hub of many local community be under threat from the same force that claim the crooked house that be why be here today be here to say that enough be enough and that it be time to put people and history before money it be time that we enshrine the protection of our heritage pub in law to give they the good chance of survive the force of greed and also the wind of change imagine future madam deputy speaker where every historic pub be safeguard where people can not act with impunity and where our community can thrive around these cherish institution it be future that we can create but only if we act soon we need improved legislation that empower and compel local council to well protect our heritage pub legislation that make it financially unviable for those who destroy our history legislation that enshrine the right of community to have say in the future of the local pub in meaningful way and legislation that will give these pub the good chance to survive as business in prepare this bill it be important that acknowledge the advice and support that receive from so many mr greg mulholland former member of this place who lead the campaign for pub my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright who provide incisive advice and the many local people who give their support under the umbrella of the campaign to rebuild the crooked house some of whom be in the public gallery today there be three key element to the propose legislation the first examine the role of local government the second how temporary restriction on the sale of heritage pub could give they fighting chance and the third how the process for the purchase of asset of community value can be assist by this legislation the first step would empower and compel local government to create and maintain register of heritage pub this would trigger assessment for possible listing it would highlight their local importance and ensure that local planner have immediate visibility of any impending activity on site at point of sale the crooked house have no protection whatever and an immediate application for list have no chance of succeed while event unfold very quickly the current voluntary scheme be obviously inadequate and can not keep pace with those who will act out of greed and with impunity in wales under section of the historic environment wales act building be automatically give statutory protection while welsh ministers make listing decision these protection apply until welsh ministers have make their decision this be an example of something that could apply in england the second element would involve place temporary restriction on the sale of heritage pub that be not something that would normally advocate meddle with property right go against all my instinct but if an asset with heritage and local community value be to have chance of survive against the change in purchasing habit of customer and against the cold hard decision make by brewery accountant have conclude that restrict the sale of these pub temporarily for month period to pub trade only buyer and at price independently agree by trade specialist seem like reasonable step to take to give these beleaguered building fighting chance at the end of the month period should sale not be agree then the pub will return on to the open free market for sale this mechanism could give local landlord with low operating cost and overhead compare with those of brewery the opportunity to make success of the pub at purchase price that be not compete with residential development buyer finally will address the process for asset of community value this be good scheme that work well for certain asset such as local community hall but can it work with the speed require when owner and buyer can move very quickly and can the scheme handle the more complex nature of an asset that could still host struggle go concern well the crooked house prove that the acv scheme could not have cop acv could well have place if local community become aware and mobilise during the month restriction period refer to early and an application be make at the end of this period part of the acv process require local community to raise fund and complete transaction within six month timeframe the restriction period would effectively enhance that process by month make the chance of subsequent and successful acv purchase much great the ongoing loss of our heritage pub can represent devastating loss to local community heritage pub can fail for multiple reason and these complex problem obviously require more complex solution that be what be attempt to do today and ask members to stand with because if we do not act now we will see piece of our history eradicate forever say stand with the ghost of the crooked house stand with my local community in gornal sedgley dudley and far beyond who want to see the crooked house rebuild brick by brick and stand for the future of our heritage pub let we vow to protect these institution not just for ourselves but for the generation to come question put and agree to order that marco longhi lia nici robin millar gareth johnson sir edward leigh shaun bailey

cost what would say be that system that do not work for landlord will not benefit tenant and system that do not benefit tenant will not benefit landlord in the long run either we have to find balance in the bill that be what our amendment will deliver the amendment we introduce in committee include expand the range of factor that judge must consider when evict antisocial tenant provide strong protection for landlord and neighbourhood against unacceptable behaviour we also add new ground for possession to protect the functioning of the student market and ensure that student landlord can continue to evict in line with the academic year turn to housing quality although the vast majority of landlord provide warm and decent home some fall short of that standard it be unacceptable for any tenant to live in damp cold or dangerous housing for that reason we introduce measure in committee to apply and enforce decent home standard in the private rent sector for the first time that new standard which we be design with landlord and tenant group will be set out in secondary legislation we also introduce measure to outlaw deeply unfair blanket ban on rent to those with child or those in receipt of benefit in england and wales those practice have no place in fair and modern housing market will the minister assure we that proper energy efficiency standard will be contain in the

organisation in the field withdraw their support for the government they have not withdraw their support accept their disappointment with some of the amendment table on report but they have also endorse some of they include one that know be very close to the hon lady heart in relation to expand the homelessness prevention duty which have the support of organisation such as crisis the homelessness charity we will continue to work with everyone across the sector to ensure that the bill be effective when it go to the other place turn to the amendment will address they thematically start with our tenancy reform measure government new clause will ensure that tenant notice to quit can not expire within the first six month of the tenancy unless the landlord have agree that it can expire soon thus increase the amount of time tenant must remain in property at the start of the tenancy from two to six month the change ensure that landlord be able to recover the cost of replace tenant and will prevent tenant from use prs property as short term or holiday let once the six month initial period of commitment have end the tenancy will continue as normal periodic tenancy so after the six month period tenant will need to give only two month notice that ensure that tenant will retain the flexibility to end tenancy when their circumstance change or when landlord do not fulfil their responsibility this measure strike the right balance between provide landlord with the confidence they need to operate within the prs and ensure fair simple tenancy system in addition the government be explore potential exemption to the rule such as the death of tenant domestic abuse or significant hazard within the property today meet the domestic abuse housing alliance to reaffirm our intention on the exemption and make clear that victim of domestic violence will be well protect by these reform government amendment and which have just mention to the hon member for westminster north ms buck will give tenant certainty that the homelessness prevention duty will be owe when valid section notice be serve pay particular tribute to my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman for his contribution on this topic ensure that his landmark homelessness reduction act continue to be effective the prevention duty will apply where the date specify in the notice be within day and the duty may not be end simply because the day have pass this mean that household can continue to receive support while the threat of homelessness remain mindful that that will broaden the scope of the prevention duty we will carry out new burden assessment and provide funding for local authority for any additional cost alongside expand the homelessness prevention duty let take this opportunity to restate our position on another important issue the statutory homelessness code of guidance which local authority must have regard to state that authority should not consider it reasonable for homeless applicant to remain in the property until court issue bailiff warrant or writ to enforce possession order we have hear anecdotal evidence that some local authority be encourage tenant on blanket basis to remain in property until the bailiff be at the door that be wrong do so create further delay in possession penalise landlord who have legal right to their property can be stressful for the tenant and in the long run be not beneficial for they at all the guidance be clear on the importance of early prevention authority should contact landlord at an early stage to

that be the case indeed as be already the case the criminal standard of proof would need to be meet for any landlord to be convict or subject to fine or rent repayment order for such an offence finally will talk through the measure that we be add to the bill to ensure that it be implement effectively again acknowledge the contribution of other member give voice by my hon friend the member for totnes so that these reform deliver for all and avoid unintended consequence we have be clear that section of the housing act will be abolish when we be confident that the county court system be ready and we be take significant step to ensure that it be we have invest million for his majesty courts and tribunals service to deliver new end to end online possession process the government accept that we need to assess the operation of the county court possession process as we deliver our tenancy reform an efficient court system be critical to ensure there be confidence in the new tenancy system government new clause therefore require the lord chancellor to prepare an assessment of the operation of possession proceeding for rented property and for that assessment to be publish before section can be abolish for exist tenancy if the government be put all that money in and do all this planning why can the minister still not give we date for when it will happen as have just say we have always be clear that we will abolish section when we be confident that the county court system be ready can not give the hon gentleman date today because can not say until we be confident that the county court system be ready but as have say we be invest million for hm courts and tribunals service to deliver the new process it be important for he to recognise that if the court system be not ready when we make this change the big change in year it will not benefit tenant it will not benefit landlord but it will certainly not benefit tenant welcome new clause because the reality be that county court be already under very great pressure indeed however carry out the assessment will itself bring cost and of course ministry of justice budget be already strained what step will be take to support the ministry of justice and the lord chancellor with the cost of carry out that important assessment my hon and learn friend be absolutely right we have commit to make the assessment so we will ensure that the relevant funding be in place have say that we have invest million for hm courts and tribunals service to deliver new end to end online possession process but be pleased also to confirm to he today that we be invest furth million this financial year to deliver new digital system the minister have try to blame the levelling up housing and communities committee for this delay by say that we note that there be problem in the court which would need to be ready to deal with the extra work cause by the abolition of section however the government have have five year to sort the court out and get they work properly surely that have be plan for right from the last election on the select committee ask for improvement to the court just point out that we ask for specialist housing court bit like small claim court that could process thing more quickly we do not ask for that in our report last year we ask for it in and the government reject it think have be quite clear that it be important that we see that the court be ready for these reform the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for finchley and golders green mike freer be here on the front bench with he and the moj be work at pace to ensure that the court be ready for the reform we be introduce the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts ask about specialist housing court we do not believe that that be the good way to improve the court process for possession view share by the judiciary who respond to our call for evidence the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts rightly say that this should have happen five year ago but gently say that in those five year we have have the coronavirus pandemic which be the main thing that have slow down the process of improve the court strongly encourage the minister not to rush into do this prematurely because it would benefit neither tenant nor landlord if he do do not think that it will surprise you madam deputy speaker to learn that entirely agree with my hon friend whom thank for make those point government new clause will enable the government to assess the effect that our new tenancy system be have on county court before our reform be roll out more widely give we confidence that the sector be ready be happy to share with colleague that we be explore whether serious eviction case such as for antisocial behaviour can be prioritise in court listing we will consult on option follow royal assent recently meet rentstart homelessness organisation with great track record of work with landlord and get the homeless into rent accommodation it be slightly concerned that the change might undermine its relationship with landlord which it use to facilitate the finding of home for many vulnerable constituent and other people who have come into the constituency in relation to the assessment that new clause would bring about what reassurance can the minister give such organisation the assessment be there purely to determine the timeliness of possession proceeding in addition we must acknowledge that there be other barrier to possession such as the role of local authority and bailiff in the process hope that that be what the assessment be able to draw out on rentstart in my right hon friend constituency do not believe that our reform will affect its relationship with landlord but be more than happy to meet he and rentstart to understand its concern more clearly and see if we can do anything to address they government new clause require the government to arrange for review of the new tenancy system in particular the impact of remove fix term and the operation of ground for possession that review will be carry out by an independent person who will produce report of their finding the new clause require the government to lay the report before parliament within month of the early date on which the new tenancy system be apply to exist tenancy we recognise that remove fix term be significant change for the sector and the review will explicitly consider the impact of the change it will also consider how comprehensive and fair the reform ground for possession be as well as the extent to which they be operate effectively so that all party can have confidence in they as have say the new tenancy system be huge change for the sector the big in year and it be right that we commit in legislation to review its impact and implementation and that we consider whether change be need base on real world evidence that will ensure that the system work as well as possible for all party in the long term have mention several time in debate and in useful meeting that have with the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities the hon member for kensington felicity buchan who be here that there be need to amend the protection from eviction act at the same time because there be danger that frustrated rogue landlord will refer back to that legislation which be very badly understand and not well enforce by the police and local authority will the minister say few thing about that be more than happy to address those point before the end of the debate but think that have write to the hon lady about they if have not will ensure that do in order to be clear about the amendment she have table government new clause place duty on the secretary of state to produce an annual report to parliament on the stock of residential tenancy in the private rent sector that report will need to be provide in the five year after the bill receive royal assent report under that duty would cover but not be limit to an analysis of the number location and size of private rent sector property the new clause ensure that regular analysis of such information be available for scrutiny and debate be aware that several member have raise concern about the interaction between the property portal and the role of selective licensing the two system have separate distinct purpose the portal will gather datum on private rent sector ownership and property standard in england provide an information source for local authority to have oversight of the whole private rent sector in their area it will help landlord to understand their legal obligation and will give tenant the information they need to make informed choice meanwhile selective licensing provide local housing authority with the power to license privately rent property within designate area to address specific local issue include poor housing condition and high level of antisocial behaviour or crime while there will be overlap with datum gather through the portal the information require for licence in these area will be specific to the issue be tackle and will support more intensive enforcement action in the area that need it most we do not want to see selective licensing abolish but we do want to ensure that our reform be streamline and that burden be minimise for landlord and local authority that be why be commit to review of selective licensing and the licensing of house in multiple occupation to consider how we can reduce burden and make the system more effective for landlord tenant and local authority be keen to work closely with member and the wide sector on this issue and will provide further detail in due course have sit on many bill committees in this house and have now be privileged to lead my first bill committee face the hon member for greenwich and woolwich he have be great person to work with and have seek at every opportunity to make sure the bill work and be effective say to he in committee that we would listen to suggestion for how we can improve the bill and we be do so today for tenant we be expand the homelessness prevention grant and closing loophole in the system for landlord we be introduce an initial six month tenancy and give they certainty that our reform will work the bill deliver on our manifesto commitment it give tenant security and landlord fairness our amendment continue to strike that balance and commend they to the house before call the shadow minister remind colleague that if they wish to intervene on speech it be important that they have be in the chamber since the beginning of the speech just in case the important point they wish to raise have already be address it be also important that they stay for the duration of the speech in case other colleague then refer to the important point that they have raise clarify that because we may have long speech from the shadow minister and people may wish to intervene so think it would be helpful to remind colleague of those rule rise on behalf of the opposition to speak to the new clause and amendment that stand in my name it be pleasure to finally be back in the chamber to conclude the remain stage of this important piece of legislation say finally because as you will know madam deputy speaker the bill leave committee on november last year almost five month ago indeed such have be the delay in bring it back to the house that in the intervene day the department even manage to complete all the commons stage of another piece of housing legislation albeit distinctly limited and unambitious one in the form of the leasehold and freehold reform bill the reason for the delay be of course an open secret with the ongoing resistance to the legislation from score of government members include many with relevant interest as private renter across the country have certainly note and the undignified wrangling between they and ministers splash across the paper for month the damage cause by the discord on the government benches have be significant not only have thousand of additional private renter be put at risk of homelessness as result of be serve section notice in the month for which the bill remain stage have be delay the sector as whole have be leave in limbo not know whether the bill will proceed at all and if it do what form it will take indeed such have be the frustration at the impact on landlord and tenant of the endless rumour speculation and off the record briefing that have take place two organisation as different in their outlook as crisis and the national residential landlords association feel compel to come together to issue joint statement plead with the government to bring to an end the destabilising and damaging uncertainty and lack of progress it have now finally be bring to an end not with ministers summon up the courage to face down their unruly back benchers as they could have do with the vote of labour members if require but as be par for the course with this weak and divide conservative government with series of concession design to placate those back benchers at the expense of private renter who will see number of the right and protection initially provide for by the bill water down the very fact that the government be now suggest that the bill require far significant amendment be ironic give that the argument repeatedly make in committee by the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities the hon member for redcar jacob young as he resist labour amendment be that the bill as originally draft strike precisely the right balance between the interest of landlord and those of tenant today he have be put in the undignified position of have to come to the dispatch box to ask the house to accept in good faith that conversation with conservative back benchers in the wake of committee stage have convince the government in all sincerity that more amendment be now essential to ensure that balance be keep it be frankly laughable the reality of the grubby political horse trading that have take place within the government be entirely transparent the truth be that when it come to this bill the only balance that the government have ever seek to strike be between attempt to honour the letter of the conservative party manifesto commitment and appease the vested interest press for the very minimum amount of reform require to assert that that commitment have be meet before turn to the detail of the amendment before we let briefly set out labour position on the bill as we consider its remain stage with the government have promise private renter over five year ago that they would scrap section no fault eviction we maintain that this legislation be shamefully overdue give that any further delay would cause yet more harm both to private tenant who be desperately in need of great right and protection and to responsible landlord who above all else require certainty we believe that as imperfect as the bill be it be essential that it complete its passage today despite our good effort in committee the bill still contain numerous defect deficiency omission and loophole that would allow the minority of disreputable landlord to exploit tenant and jeopardise their security of tenure we remain therefore firmly of the view that the bill be not yet fit for purpose and must be strengthen for the benefit of renter as the government appear determined to do the opposite and far tilt the play field towards the landlord interest we be determined not only to continue to press for those change that we argue for in committee but to oppose those government amendment that be detrimental to the interest of private tenant and that jeopardise the integrity of the bill as introduce and risk fatally undermine it with the former objective in mind turn first to the amendment and new clause that we have table for consideration nearly all be identical to the one we press to division in committee they aim among other thing to increase the minimum notice period in respect of de facto no fault possession ground from two to four month remove the punitive and draconian new ground relate to repeat rent arrear well protect renter against unreasonable within tenancy rent increase allow the tribunal to make rent repayment order for additional specific breach prohibit rental bidding war extend awaab law to the private rented sector and maintain the exist ground definition of antisocial behaviour rather than the government expansive new definition of be capable of cause annoyance or nuisance commend each of those amendment and new clause to the house of particular importance to we be the need to ensure that section eviction be definitively abolish at the point that the bill become law as draft the legislation provide for two stage commencement process for the introduction of the new tenancy regime with the precise date for new and exist tenancy to transition determine by the secretary of state we make it clear in committee that we believe that this two stage transition process be the right approach it would clearly not be sensible to enact the whole of part chapter of the bill immediately on royal assent however we argue that landlord and tenant should be give certainty about precisely when the government manifesto commitment to abolish section no fault eviction will be enact in resist our effort in committee to amend the bill so that section be repeal on the day the bill be formally approve the minister argue as the government have consistently do since announce the concession in their response of october to the select committee that it would be wrong to do so until the court be ready the problem be that the government have never be able to clearly articulate precisely what ready in that context mean indeed after week of debate in committee what minister believe the necessary court improvement encompass and what criterion will be use to determine whether sufficient progress have be achieve remain entirely ambiguous hon member may recall that the background briefing note accompany the king speech suggest that the require improvement relate only to the court possession action process in contrast the government response to the select committee last year outline far more expansive list of target area for improvement include many element of the wide package of court reform allude to in the white paper we have hop that the minister would bring some clarity to the matter in committee yet in response to forensic questioning from hon member about exactly how the government believe the county court system be underperform what the precise nature be of the improvement they believe be require before section be completely abolish and how progress on deliver those improvement will be measure the hon gentleman unfortunately offer little more than vague comment about ongoing digitisation action to tackle bailiff delay and end to end process as result as we contemplate send this bill to the other place today not only do renter still have no idea when the new tenancy system will come into force but they remain entirely in the dark on what may constitute requisite progress on the court reform that ministers deem necessary in our view such degree of uncertainty be simply unacceptable the end of no fault eviction can not be make dependent on an unspecified degree of future progress in court improvement subjectively determine by ministers the hon member be make an interesting point about uncertainty understand where he be come from and many of we on this side would very much like to see section abolition implement as soon as possible do he however accept that there be another uncertainty which be that if the court system be not work adequately the amount of private housing stock available for many of our constituent who need it badly could easily shrink fast as indeed believe have happen in scotland that would be much great risk than not lay out at this stage the precise date at which section abolition will be fully implement would say two thing to the hon gentleman who make valid point first the government have have five year since they first make the commitment to abolish section to get the court fit for purpose and they have not do so indeed the timescale for both possession and litigation have remain essentially unchanged since so there have be no progress in those five year the actual process of possession proceeding be also probably one of the more efficient aspect of the county court system we hear extensive evidence in committee about the fact that the system be essentially work fairly well and be recover well from covid and that these change would not be significant enough to delay the implementation even if that be not the case would say to he that we should have clarity about precisely what be the improvement the government think be necessary let we have metric and let we have timeline and then we can have an open and transparent conversation about precisely what ready mean at the moment we be entirely in the dark we will remain in the dark even if government new clause be incorporate into the bill because it will merely require the lord chancellor to publish an assessment of the operation of the county court possession order process in england and its enforcement before the extend application date can be set for chapter of part of the bill there be no timescale in which that require assessment need to be publish and there be nothing that specify the metric against which the lord chancellor would judge the readiness of the court system there be no corresponding obligation impose on the secretary of state so if future lord chancellor assess that funding or other specific measure be require to make the court ready for the new system there be nothing to compel the government of the day to implement they even if future lord chancellor be to assess that the court be more than ready it remain for the secretary of state to determine whether they wish to make the relevant commencement order even if clause be amend by government new clause and like my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham understand where the hon gentleman be come from and do not have problem with the abolition of section no fault eviction however as south east london mp he will know that the reality be that the county court face enormous pressure particularly in our part of the world hope that before hon member perhaps criticise the government too much they will talk to their own local county court because the data be suggest that on average we could be look at about week from the commencement of possession claim until the decision be make and on top of that we have the enforcement period that be not acceptable and want it to be quick but we need to accept therefore as the association of his majesty district judges have point out and have to say to hon member that the datum the justice committee have be the most accurate that there have be underfunding of the county court for many year frankly that have be under government of both party because can remember when be in practice and the hon gentleman party be in government and there be underfunding of the county court then as well we all have to take our share of responsibility for that rather than make it matter of party controversy thank the hon and learn gentleman for that point we all want the process to be quick do not think that be in dispute at all and they certainly could be make quick landlord need robust ground for possession in legitimate circumstance and they need the system to operate quickly when they do the question for we today be should we essentially put the abolition of section on hold until we have reassurance about an undefined amount of improvement and if we do not know when that be go to be deliver all have hear be about the importance of ensure that the court be function quickly enough to enable landlord to evict the tenant they want to evict but currently renter have just over month before they be evict have constituent who lose his son in the most horrific of circumstance it be in the local paper whose family be serve section notice the landlord know the family have lose child but say they have to serve it because the family still have month and they need to get they to leave where be the protection for renter and do my hon friend agree that kicking abolition of section notice into the long grass mean the government do not care about renter at all my hon friend be right to highlight the impact on renter and that be essentially what we be debate with every month that pass more private renter be serve section notice nearly of they have be put at risk of homelessness as result of be serve one of those notice as the government have delay the implementation of their commitment as the bill be draft even with government new clause ministers can determine whenever they want to signal to the house that the court be ready we have have no assurance on that point and that be not satisfactory in our view government new clause be nothing more than mechanism design to facilitate the further delay of the complete abolition of section eviction and we will look to vote against it with the government have previously make it clear that there will be requirement for advance notice of six month before new tenancy be convert and minimum of month between that conversion and the transition of exist tenancy with proposal that the latter will also be make subject to the assessment require by government new clause it could be year before renter see section completely abolish make complete mockery of the secretary of state recent claim that such notice will be outlaw by the next general election we know the government be in no rush to abolish section eviction because they be not lay the groundwork that be necessary for that to happen where be the draft prescribe form for section notice and where be the propose amend court form and civil procedure rule there be no sign of they or of any sense of what the regulation require to bring they forward might be the truth be that ministers determine long ago for reason that be entirely obvious to essentially kick the can down the road on abolish section while disingenuously deny it although the passage of the bill will be take as signal of abolition before the next general election private renter outside will know that be not the case and that implementation have be push back potentially indefinitely we believe that hard press renter have wait long enough for the commitment make by the conservatives over five year ago to be deliver they require certainty that it will truly be honour and section eviction definitively abolish with the passing of this legislation our amendment would provide that certainty by ensure that section of the housing act be repeal on the day that the bill receive royal assent with save provision for any notice serve before that date so that they remain valid and of lawful effect commend the amendment to the house government new clause and to which have make reference be only three of the government amendment table just before the deadline last week before conclude will touch briefly on several of the more substantive among they start with the small number that will be genuine improvement to the bill we be pleased that the government have respond to our call to ensure the maintenance of number of the regulatory obligation that have build up around section notice over the year by table government new clause which give the secretary of state the power by regulation to transpose those precondition and requirement into section eviction notice similarly we be pleased that the government have listen to the argument make by my hon friend the member for weaver vale mike amesbury in committee and that government amendment will amend the bill to ensure that tenant maintain the right to access homelessness support when serve with valid section notice sadly those and other sensible government amendment include new clause and be overshadow by other that be far more concerning chief among they government new clause as the minister explain new clause will prevent renter from serve notice to quit within the first four month of tenancy couple with the two month notice period provide for by the bill as introduce tenant will be unable to leave property until they have reside in it for at least six month unless the landlord agree otherwise the government have commit to consider exemption to this fix initial six month letting period in serious circumstance such as domestic abuse the death of tenant or serious hazard be present in the property however nothing in the new clause as draft guarantee that any such exemption will ultimately be make or what they would look like in practice even if such exemption be introduce we believe that the propose six month initial period would still be extremely damaging not only would place the onus on tenant to prove that they qualify for an exemption under serious circumstance deter many particularly those experience domestic abuse from explore such an option but fix initial period of any kind risk fatally undermine the integrity of the new tenancy regime premise as it be on all future assure tenancy be periodic and open end with tenant able to end their tenancy when they see fit with appropriate notice as provide for by the bill the government have advance two argument in justify their eleventh hour introduction of new clause first that it will ensure that the cost bear by landlord of find tenant and make repair between tenancy be cover and secondly that it will prevent tenant from use rented property as short term let all the available evidence suggest that the prohibitive cost of move be lead to tenant stay long in their home there be no evidence to support the entirely hypothetical notion that tenant be likely to game the new tenancy regime en masse to use rental property as short term let the truth be that there be no compelling rationale for government new clause as the minister know full well if the government be not have to appease small minority in their own rank they would not be propose it we believe that the propose six month initial period will not only trap large number of tenant in unsafe and unsuitable property but put at risk the coherence of the tenancy regime that be at the heart of the bill and we will look to vote against it in conclusion this be long overdue piece of legislation and it be imperative that it progress today there be no question about that but for those of we on the opposition benches the bill as introduce be only ever starting point for overhaul the regulation of the private rent sector as it progress the bill should have be enhance so that the play field between landlord and tenant be level decisively instead the fractious state of the conservative party have see the government make concession after concession in an attempt fruitless attempt from what we can see to placate minority of member on the government benches we need to draw line today on what that minority can extract from ministers to the detriment of private renter who deserve well and we need to strengthen the bill in number of important respect urge the house to come together to do so there be many amendment on which could speak indeed the book of amendment seem to be almost as long if not long than the bill itself but will limit myself to new clause which have table in my name and those of hon friend and colleague and on which amendment to be contingent first declare my interest in the register of members financial interests as chair of the quality and safeguard board for child company new clause go to the heart of my interest as it deal with care experience child essentially its purpose be to ensure that landlord do not discriminate against people who have grow up in the care system when make decision on whom to rent property to it would place specific duty on landlord prevent they from deny those who have grow up in the care system tenancy on that basis landlord find to be in breach of the new clause could be subject to penalty that be the thrust of what be try to achieve and it might strike chord with many colleague here some may remember recent case that highlight the potential problem the guinness housing trust in advertise property for rent specifically say that it be not available to care leaver that be an extraordinary piece of discrimination redolent of the bad old day when people put up sign say no dog no irish no black if we can remember back that far in that recent case there be potential discrimination against young people who through no fault of their own have be through the care system guinness fortunately withdraw that straight away and apologise but the case reinforce the vulnerability of some of the most vulnerable young people in our society when try to get the most basic of daily requirement roof over their head that be what be behind the new clause thank the coalition of various charity and organisation that have do lot of the heavy lifting on this issue lead by barnardo and the charity for care experienced young people become as well as other let say at the outset that new clause be probe amendment and be grateful for the positive engagement have have from the minister already be wholly optimistic that he will say some helpful and constructive thing when he come to respond will flesh out why this be an important amendment to this important bill in which fully admit there be many other priority as you know madam deputy speaker have long stand interest in championing care experienced young people whether formerly as child minister or now as the chair of the all party parliamentary group for child and vice chair of the all party parliamentary group for care experience child and young people why do we need to do more to support care leaver when access accommodation in the private rent sector it be imperative first for we to consider the big picture with the issue that our young people leave care face more than child and young people be in the care system in england which be recent high every year more than of they leave that care system we all know that unfortunately despite all the good effort and endeavour of successive governments and ministers care leaver still have much poor outcome than their peer they be less likely to gain good qualification in the education system nearly half of the child in the care system have mental health problem and it be estimate that quarter of homeless people have be in care at some point in their life they be also disproportionately represent in the justice system and make up over quarter of serve prisoner from the age of care experience young people be often expect to be financially independent and manage their own household bill but research over many decade have show that care leaver be much more financially vulnerable than their peer significant number live on or near the poverty line and struggle to make end meet interruption be be echo as if members can not get enough of once they be now get it in stereo with time delay while inflation be begin to come down certain sector continue to see large price increase include the private rent sector private rental price pay by tenant in the uk rise by some in the month to january this year unchanged for the second consecutive month and that put huge pressure on all tenant young care leaver live independently at the age of just have no support from the bank of mum and dad and for they thing can be especially tough the member be make very important and excellent point about care leaver do he agree that one of the problem be that on reach the age of they be deem to be able to be independent but they have no support network in the way other young people of often do and therefore while they be get housing support they might not be get the necessary emotional and advice support that all other year old get and benefit from there be therefore need for some sort of arrangement to ensure there be continued level of support well after the age of if the individual young person actually want that agree with the right hon gentleman up to point and of course young people do not magically become much more self sustainable and resilient the day after their birthday but there have be many improvement over the year there be extend support for care leaver up to the age of and there be arrangement whereby they can still have relationship include financial relationship for example with foster carer through the stay put scheme the government have come up with and many charity and organisation do very good work in provide support but the point the right hon gentleman make be right most of we be lucky enough to be able to go run back home to birth family for help and support in difficult time but that be not always available to young people in the care system although many do have the continual support of good quality foster carer and other carer they rely on when they be under the age of however they be vulnerable and ensure these young people have safe and stable home to start their adult life be really crucial housing can act as vehicle for stability and without access to good quality accommodation young people will face challenge in get job stay in education and ongoing training access health service and everything else however despite the key role housing can play in help young person transition to independent living many care leaver be struggle to find suitable accommodation in those early year after leave care it be estimate that one in three care leaver become homeless in the first two year immediately after they leave care and one in four homeless people have be in care at some point in their life as mention early young care leaver face many barrier in access appropriate accommodation and many will not be able to be address in this bill however it do offer an opportunity to address one of those barrier that landlord sometimes feel reluctant to rent to young people who have grow up in the care system young people in care tell charitable organisation in the youth sector that they come across landlord who be reluctant to rent to they because of their circumstance and evidence from survey of care leaver carry out by the charity centrepoint find that over one in some they have be unable to access accommodation because the landlord be unwilling to accommodate they because of their status that be not fair the problem be also likely to get bad give the grow evidence of reduction in the number of private rental property available across england an investigation by the bbc find the number of property available to rent across the whole of the uk have fall by third in the month up to march and increase competition for the property that be available have enable more landlord to pick and choose which tenant they like often go for the high bidder which of course make it especially challenge for vulnerable group such as care leaver in the last few year barnardo have be run campaign to try and improve access to suitable accommodation for care leaver certainly support the campaign which call on all local authority to offer rent guarantor and deposit scheme for care leaver seek to rent in the private rent sector the macalister report on child in social care which the government commission and which be publish last year make recommendation that be care experienced child should be protect characteristic so far in excess of local authority include my own in west sussex have voluntarily acknowledge that although the government have not make it statutory addition at this stage so some local authority be already provide help to care leaver with deposit or scheme where they can act as corporate guarantor such scheme greatly help make care experienced young people more attractive tenant and number of local authority report that such scheme have have significant success the scheme operate by kent county council have have no rent default from when it start in until however such scheme be not offer by most local authority freedom of information request by the care leaver local offer website to the local authority in england with child social care department show that will not act as guarantor for care leaver understand barnardo be currently in conversation with the department for education on how these scheme can be extend with more local authority be encourage to develop they that be welcome but while such scheme will help they will not be successful if landlord continue to have reluctance to rent to this group and instead pass they over in favour of young professional who can offer the backing of family or personal guarantor or high income on their own term that be why through this amendment be urge the minister to extend the provision in the bill to require landlord not to discriminate against certain group of tenant include care leaver young people who have grow up in care have often face very difficult circumstance in their life which be why they end up in care and when they come into the care of the state we agree that we would become their corporate parent very much see the amendment as key to fulfil this duty in provide important extra support to care leaver ensure more of they will be able to access safe and stable accommodation that they can call home in closing want to say that there be basis for have consideration for foster family as well know from my experience work with foster group that landlord can be reluctant to rent to foster family who have number of child who will change and may be little more problematic in some case as well however foster family do an essential job and we be short of about or foster carer in this country and the last thing we need be for they not to be able to offer safe stable love home to child who have be through traumatic experience because they can not get into rent accommodation themselves as landlord do not want to be housing child who may be little more challenging in some circumstance but in most case be not so consideration must be give to the idea that landlord should regard foster care family as people to be encourage because they be do noble and worthy job for vulnerable child and frankly that be just the sort of tenant they should want to encourage so perhaps in consider the way we treat care leaver themselves go out into the big wide world to rent we should also be mindful of the need of foster carer who have do such fantastic job in pick those child and young people up and guide they through to adulthood want to secure the minister commitment to work with colleague particularly in the department for education which have the lead responsibility for child in the care system to consider how to involve landlord when develop new rent guarantor and deposit scheme for care leaver and to agree to keep the issue under review with the possibility of use power the secretary of state have under the bill to extend the non discrimination clause to group such as child with care experience know my hon friend the minister be sympathetic to the thrust of my probe amendment and in his response and the government official response on these matter we must send out very clear signal that discriminate against child in the care system and care leaver be not on people should have more of duty of care to do everything they can to make sure those young people who have miss out on many of the thing we take for grant safe and love family at home be not disadvantaged yet again by not be able to get roof over their head hope the minister will respond favourably to this probe amendment and be sure he will rise order before call the next speaker inform the house that will be give priority to those member who have amendment down so that they can speak to they before we hear from other call chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee clive betts it be disappointing that we be have to focus primarily on the government back pedal on the timetable for the abolition of section the levelling up housing and communities committee look at this year ago and conclude unanimously that the principle of the government intention be right we have some reservation and caveat and we raise concern and suggest detail change but nevertheless we agree on the principle generally speak there be agreement across the house that it be the right thing to do in the meantime people be live in uncertainty in private rent housing that be why we think it be the right thing to do that be what the measure be for to give people great certainty about where they will be live in year time it be not merely that it be also so that they know if they do not have car that they can get on the bus to their place of work in the morning if the landlord evict they and they have to move home will they be able to get to that job in the future it be also about child at school will those child be able to get to the same school if they be evict from their home and have to find new property that be the sort of family certainty that the abolition of section will introduce so many family be live in uncertainty not just housing uncertainty but other uncertainty while we await that abolition the minister need to get on with it and give we some clear time commitment on when it will happen we have just discuss the problem of the court of course covid have affect lot of public service but say to the minister that it be not surprise if we look at how long it be take local authority to get court hearing to deal with antisocial behaviour case before covid we see even then that those run into month it have be problem in the court for many year that be why the committee have suggest it have be suggest before housing court system know that minister do not want it and that the ministry of justice do not want it but it seem to we way of resolve what be often simple or quick problem small claim court format could do it in many case without the need for lawyer to be introduce be sorry but have no conviction that with several month of look at this several year of contemplation and plan for action the court will be any quick in two or three year than they be now the court system have delay and they be likely to remain so we need to look bit beyond the exist system to resolve these problem obviously ministers have set their mind against that turn to the other main problem that we highlight on implementation local authority and their staff we know that local authority be desperately short of staff for enforcement in the private rent sector once section go tenant who be currently frightened even those live in appal damp property to make complaint against their landlord because they be concerned they would be evict as soon as complaint be make will feel emboldened to make that complaint and if their complaint be not listen to they will be embolden to go to their local authority and ask for help local authority will get more request for help and they have not get the people to deal with that will the minister assure we that he be start to talk to the local government association about the new burden that will be place on local authority this be new burden that we be impose on they albeit good one and that there be some agreement on the resource that will be need resource do not produce extra staff overnight so local authority will need advance warning so that we have the staff in place to respond quickly apologise for interrupt the hon gentleman give the important point he be make about redress for tenant and who they might go to would he add any comment on consumer protection for unfair trading which be one of the remedy for those who have difficulty with either the standard and quality of their property or the landlord as well as those who have be mi sell for rental period think the reality be that local authority be generally short of resource right through as the committee recent report on local authority funding again it be unanimously agree show because of the demand of social care on local authority budget other service be often cut even more than the mainstream we have previously look at trading standard and consumer protection which be an important element the hon member be absolutely right and hope that they will be factor in when we have the new burden discussion there be some thing that the minister could resolve fairly quickly he refer to the important role that the ombudsman can play in resolve dispute there be sometimes bit of conflict between whether someone go to the ombudsman or to the court sometimes the ombudsman will not deal with case if it be in the court it would be helpful to clarify those issue but why do he not just decide that the housing ombudsman who currently deal with social housing issue will also deal with private sector housing he should make that decision again if the ombudsman be to have that responsibility it need to gear up by start to recruit more staff and get in resource to be able to do it it be simple decision he have not rule it out but he have not rule it in can we not just do it it seem obvious why set up another body which would have to start from scratch when the ombudsman have the skill to do it those skill be slightly different in some case but why not let it get on with that and tell it now that it will have that job to do have couple of other point the property portal be really welcome development we know that when someone be try to track down landlord it be often local authority which want to serve notice on they suddenly the ownership of the property move and different member of the family become an owner or different company be set up to know who own the property information will have to be give to the property portal along with all other information about the property that be really important step forward as well as make sure that the portal be digitise so that the information can be keep up to date simply welcome the minister say that selective licensing and the property portal be not the same thing with the property portal to be there for all property selective licensing it be in the name will be there for some property when there be review of selective licensing and the relationship with the property portal will the proposal come back to the house for consideration at some point want reassurance on that many of we support selective licensing which we see operate against the bad landlord and the bad property and we hope that there will not be diminution of those power and responsibility that would weaken what it can achieve can certainly commit to work with the hon member and his committee when we be at the point of make decision on where we go after such review completely agree that selective licensing have its role it be not overtake by the property portal but we must ensure that the two work together that be helpful assurance which accept and think he have already give assurance of similar collaboration on the decent home standard which be appreciate finally come specifically to some complicated amendment that have table admit that they even confuse on occasion which be about the power that social landlord have when they come to regenerate area the committee have hear some pretty awful example of poor property in the social housing sector and we have be critical however often it be not an individual property that be the problem but property in deck access block build in the or the property have reach the end of its life and people do not like live there it might have damp or other problem such as antisocial behaviour the management cost be high and the cost of regeneration make it fit for purpose and bring it up to decent home standard be so great that it be not worth spend the money in some case demolition and rebuild be need and in other substantial regeneration and improvement be need and that mean the tenant have to move out in those case social landlord need to be certain that they have the power to require tenant to move because in block of property of resident of they will probably be terribly enthusiastic about move out particularly if they be go to get new or refurbish home but the other five might dig their heel in and try to stick it out hold up the whole scheme the minister believe that social landlord have the power to do that under exist legislation have table amendment and the related amendment because the national housing federation be concerned that social landlord think they have power but they do not exist where the initial tenancy with their secure tenant be set up by nomination from local authority it be complicated legal issue but an important one the nhf be also concerned that although someone can be move on by secure tenancy be take away and another be give where someone be be move on not to secure tenancy because it be decant property pende their home be refurbish social landlord may not have the same power there be legal and technical complication in this area will not press my amendment but table they because the nhf be still concerned even with the minister assurance will he agree to meet and the nhf to try to ensure that landlord have the power to act in this way which think everyone will support they to do the hon gentleman make legitimate point and be more than happy to meet he and the national housing federation thank the minister for that response on that collaborative point will end my contribution be very pleased to follow the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee on which sit he express very well the importance of the section reform in particular to family and to renter who be so reliant on they my view be that the bill do not go far enough in deal with the fundamental challenge of the private rent sector which be no long flex or transitionary tenure but the main tenure for million of people for much if not all of their life there have be long term structural shift away from social renting and home ownership into an expand private rent sector that shift need to be address by build more home affordable home and for first time buyer and by find new balance that reflect the new reality for million of people in our country sadly the original principle of the bill which be to create fair and responsible new rented sector have be undermine by the government amendment that change of position undermine not just the bill but the very manifesto commitment on which the conservative government be elect in turn to the amendment and new clause that stand in my name new clause would require landlord to make relocation payment to the tenant if the tenant be evict within two year of the start of the tenancy other than on exempted ground such as antisocial or criminal behaviour evidence from shelter and generation rent show that unrecoverable cost the waste cost to the renter of an unwanted move can be between and my new clause propose that payment would be make by the landlord in recognition of those unrecoverable cost to the tenant be evicted place great emotional strain on tenant who find themselves in insecure housing it should not place they under financial strain as well amendment would amend ground possession due to failure to carry out an obligation of the tenancy in schedule to the housing act set out the ground for possession that provision will gain much great importance follow these change for it be the catch all provision for eviction the amendment be intend to address the risk of be serve notice for eviction for trivial matter such as hang up washing outside display poster on wall or teenager put up poster with blu tack those be real example write into exist tenancy agreement by let agency that be member of their relevant professional body amendment would provide that ground could be use only for material breach not for blu tack the minister have write to to say that there be landlord who want to make the ground position mandatory these be landlord who want to be able to serve notice and evict tenant for use blu tack in my book if you be to lose your home it should be for serious reason not for blu tack or hang the washing outside or any other trivial thing all the more so because we know that the majority of eviction take place when notice be give to the tenant without court application let alone court repossession order the law society have raise the issue of the scarcity of legal advice available to tenant across the country we have hear already today that the government have not yet produce even work draft of what the new form might be for the new eviction ground that also matter because at the moment the court form require the ground to be set out in the document they do not require for example for that to specify whether it be in fact discretionary or other ground for the court so this do impact directly on tenant understanding and ability to challenge their potential eviction as such the government position which be to allow ground the blu tack ground unamended be to invite every landlord to invoke spurious and unfair reason for eviction this be apparently not the intent of the bill be grateful to the minister for his engagement with on that ground ask he to reconsider that position and see what more can be do to ensure that ground apply only in relation to serious matter that seem much more reasonable and fair to landlord and tenant alike on government new clause when speak to major landlord recently they confirm that they be not yet ready to digitise they be not yet ready to put in place and work with the very provision for which they have so strongly advocate understand that it might take some more than two year to put their own system in place to engage with the new measure they have ask for meanwhile and after all this time nearly five year the government have no detailed plan about what these court change might be in november in committee the minister deny that this be delaying tactic however since then the ministry of justice have publish its digitisation and reform programme all the way through to there be absolutely no reference not even an indicative reference to this reform programme relate to repossession ask the house of commons library for assistance but it too have be unable to find any specific reference to the change that may come up in the court process so be afraid that the truth be that new clause be delaying tactic to benefit landlord as have be mention the levelling up housing and communities committee have write to the minister on the implementation of these measure it have be note by the committee that court guidance be already in place to deal with repossession claim in timely manner they be contain already in civil procedure rule of course the court can always be improve indeed it be most welcome that there be commitment that they should be so but it should be note that the ministry of justice data show that last year the target set out for repossession have in fact be meet the court performance in landlord repossession case stand in marked contrast in the recovery since covid to many other court backlog that be confirm in write evidence to the justice committee be grateful to the chair of the justice committee my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill he be not currently in his place for whom have the great respect note that in the write evidence to that committee the moj confirm just in september that of court be meet that target understand that the much large number of week to which my hon and learn friend refer may relate to personal injury and other matter that be bring before the committee but will discuss that with he later give that he be not currently in the chamber these be important reform and it be important for the court process to work in the right way but they be work within their current target in mark contrast to other court backlog that be why new clause be not necessary and be properly consider to be delaying tactic this be bill that the conservative manifesto promise would benefit tenant but it have become bill in which the balance too often favour the landlord particularly if it include new clause which could indefinitely delay the abolition of section no fault eviction that would be nothing short of betrayal of the promise that be make in and for that reason be unable to support the new clause be delighted to speak about this important bill on behalf of my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan who unfortunately could not be here today but who have do huge amount of work on it include her work in committee thank the minister for his comment about she and for the constructive way in which he have work with she throughout the bill passage so far on specific amendment some of which will discuss in due course the liberal democrats support the bill in principle because we want to ensure that the private rental market be fair for all and we have long call for section no fault eviction to be scrap barely week go by when london mp do not hear from yet another family who be be turf out of their home for spurious reason under section be sorry to say that as many other have point out the government have be far too slow in introduce these measure they have be drag into it kick and scream at every turn and have make the commitment five year ago and have have plenty of legislative time available in the last and current sessions they have delay and delay meanwhile cost of living crisis have mean even more people become homeless and rise pressure on council that be have to pay for emergency accommodation amendment table by my hon friend the member for north shropshire would increase the time that must elapse between landlord take ownership of property and make the property available for rent to six month from the currently propose three this six month period be design to act as more effective deterrent for landlord wish to evict tenant in order to remarket property quickly or flip it into holiday let note that similar amendment table by the opposition would extend the time to month the liberal democrats believe that would risk drive landlord from the market and that six month strike the right balance between protect tenant from sharp practice and not drive reputable landlord away flip or quickly remarkete property for holiday letting have cause serious injustice in some of the most beautiful place in the country such as cumbria local people live in tourist hotspot often struggle to afford home in their area because of the rapid increase in the number of property take out of residential let and use solely as short term holiday let that have knock on impact in term of workforce pressure especially in the hospitality and care sector of course there need to be some holiday accommodation in beautiful area that benefit economically from attract tourism but we must find balance between holiday and private rent sector accommodation be grateful to the government for accept that point and work constructively with the liberal democrats by table amendment although their amendment do not go quite as far as we would have like and include six month restrict period it will ensure that landlord can not remarket property as short term or holiday let within three month of purchase that be much need step towards level the play field in the housing market for local people in tourist hotspot and help local economy and community to thrive amendment which be table by my hon friend the member for north shropshire would ensure that accommodation rent from the defence infrastructure organisation by service individual and their family be subject to the decent home standard servicemen and woman be house in accommodation rent from the dio which be currently not subject to minimum standard this mean that individual who have put their life on the line for our country be not necessarily guarantee warm and safe place to live in return across the country and specifically at raf shawbury and tern hill barracks in north shropshire there have be report of service family accommodation be plague by black mould rat infestation and chronic overcrowding that be no way to treat people who have put their life on the line to serve this country frankly they deserve well amendment would ensure that all accommodation rent from the dio meet minimum housing standard such as be in reasonable state of repair and provide reasonable degree of thermal comfort without the amendment the government would miss out on crucial opportunity to finally bring service accommodation up to decent standard be sure that member on both side of the house will agree that this be the absolute minimum we should be offer to service individual so hope that the minister can offer reassurance from the dispatch box that he and his department be willing to move on this issue ahead of the bill move to the other place by work with my hon friend the member for north shropshire to ensure that the decent home standard be apply to all military service accommodation otherwise we will push the amendment to vote amendment be table by those on the opposition front bench some conservative members question why we should scrap section not just in name but by implement this legislation at the early possible opportunity but ask they what they would say to the father in my constituency who contact last year he be serve section notice for have the temerity to fix leak in his home that be cause damp and mould his landlord have refuse to do the repair and he have two child live with very serious health condition whose symptom be exacerbate by the mould the endless delay from those on the conservative benches have mean that thousand more family like my constituent have find themselves homeless last week receive another case of family who be about to be evict just as two of their child start their gcse and level some million renter household in this country include child we should be put they first which be why the liberal democrats support amendment abolish section eviction would ensure that tenant live in property suffer from disrepair or even infestation can report such issue to their landlord without the fear of revenge eviction it would also drive up standard in the rental sector and give tenant much need voice there should be absolutely no delay in the abolition of section notice also want to speak in support of amendment which be table by those on the opposition front bench it would maintain the exist definition of antisocial behaviour as be conduct causing or likely to cause nuisance or annoyance rather than be define as behaviour capable of cause nuisance or annoyance that be small but critical difference in the definition of antisocial behaviour without the amendment the conservative government would be write very ambiguous definition of antisocial behaviour into the statute book the government definition of antisocial behaviour could allow landlord to use it as quick way to evict tenant or as back door to section eviction in committee my hon friend the member for north shropshire move an amendment that word the definition similarly we must have definition of antisocial behaviour that protect tenant from unfair eviction but ensure that landlord have the tool necessary to evict tenant in case of genuine disturbance in his second reading speech the secretary of state promise this house that the bill would bring tenant and landlord together to put in place strong protection for the report october vol without amendment he will fail to do so new clause which table would introduce technical change that discuss early with the minister it seek to address an anomaly in the bill as draft in relation to leaseholder seek to let their property be grateful to the minister and his official for their attention and recognise that government new clause address this issue to large extent but as discuss early with the minister look forward to work with he and discuss how we can ensure that this provision be far extend to lease where freeholder or management company consent be require for sub letting place on the record my strong support for new clause table by the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton strongly endorse all his comment on care leaver and foster family and of course he would expect to add the family of kinship carer to that category urge the government to work constructively with he on that the liberal democrats be broadly in favour of the bill and appreciate the fact that the government have agree to work with we on the importance of safeguard community from be price out by the popularity of the holiday let market despite that we would have like the bill to go far and we urge the government not to ignore this opportunity finally to guarantee service individual and their family the right to decent housing and to close the ambiguity on antisocial behaviour to ensure that it be not just another way for landlord to unfairly evict tenant end by call once again for the government to stop kick the can of abolish section down the road say gently to the minister who have be very collaborative in his comment that we have see with the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill that when the government be hellbent on do something for political purpose they will ram the legislation through they will ensure that those flight get off the ground because it serve their political purpose so if there be will there be way take on board the point about the court have to be ready but firmly believe that if this government want to do something they have the mean to achieve it therefore urge the minister again to protect renter particularly those family with child up and down the country who be face homelessness every single week this be core reform that the liberal democrats have long call for and that the government have long delay it be high time they step up and deliver it rise order before call the next hon member speak have now to announce the result of today defer division on the draft economic growth regulatory functions amendment order the ayes be and the noes be so the ayes have it the division list be publish at the end of today debate rise to speak to the amendment that stand in my name as well as on number of government amendment feel that should start by thank both the minister and the shadow minister for their conversation over the last five month on this topic should be clear about my position in lead number of amendment to the bill at no point have we ever seek to stop section come in and hope that will be able to make that clear in the course of my remark what we have seek to do be to stop the ending of fix term tenancy something believe would have dramatic impact on the supply of property include long term rental property that to be the concern believe that it will cause far great upset in the short and long term in respect of whether people can have the house that they need in rural area such as mine where housing be already very expensive more and more landlord be already decide that let their property out be not worth the candle they will therefore sell they and the effect will be that there be few and few property to rent those that be available will therefore go up and up in price and our youngster will struggle to get on to the rental ladder thank my hon friend for make that point it be one that will come on to in term of both the impact that the bill will have on the attractiveness of short term let and the bureaucracy and hassle that will arise from this legislation from the outset of the bill arrival in parliament have work to ensure that it strike the right balance between tenant and landlord balance that ensure that the right of tenant be respect and enshrine in legislation while the right of landlord property ownership and contract law be maintain and safeguard believe that failure to strike that balance would have disastrous impact on the private rental market in the united kingdom complicate the rental market with onerous request bureaucratic measure additional cost and an inability for people to operate their personal property as they wish would only result in large swathe of the private rent sector throw up their hand and sell their property just as failure to support tenant would only embolden rogue landlord diminish standard and increase unfair treatment from the start it have be my mission to find level playing field that ensure that tenant and landlord can co operate together in fair market that have healthy supply of rental property with right and standard enshrine cost low and bureaucracy minimal in system that respect the rule of law and perhaps most importantly have structure and court system that be effective and that deliver all of this have be do because we be in the midst of supply crisis in the private rented sector on which we have yet to touch on average prospective tenant inquire about every available rental property up from eight in accord to rightmove hampton estimate that between and the end of individual landlord sell almost more home than they buy last year the bank of england warn that demand for rental property continue to outstrip supply as the number of landlord choose to exit the market increase it be therefore vital that responsible landlord have confidence that pragmatic change be be make to the bill failure to do so would only deepen the crisis have say previously that the failure to have sensible rental period at the start of tenancy would likely result in the flourishing of long term rental property be use as short term let give the substantial price difference between short term let and long term let in constituency like mine and the constituency of the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan and for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron there would be very real likelihood of people exploit that loophole landlords incur cost and expense when enter into tenancy and they need the certainty of minimum period many buy to let mortgage lender also require minimum six month tenancy agreement when lend to residential landlord as result table amendment with the support of colleague to ensure that tenant can not give two month notice to leave property until they have reside in it for four month believe that this be in line with the recommendation of the levelling up housing and communities committee therefore welcome that the government have accept this argument and table new clause which mirror amendment will therefore not press my amendment wonder whether can tease out the hon gentleman reasoning in think that the possibility of rental property be use as short term let be so serious it be an entirely hypothetical problem renter who take out tenancy agreement will have to provide five week deposit they will probably be charge the maximum and they have to go through lengthy process to try to get that deposit back what evidence do he have to suggest that en masse tenant will try to game the system in the way he expect with the great of respect be say that that be one of the reason why fear not have minimum notice period my constituency have the high number of second home and short term let of almost anywhere in the country there be significant price differential and significant amount of hassle be be heap on landlord by this bill which might push they in that direction this may be one of the foreseeable consequence have raise it on second reading and in private conversation with the hon gentleman new clause on rent repayment order would enable local housing authority to impose financial penalty on certain individual where they believe that housing offence have be commit by body corporate last year the supreme court deliver landmark ruling in which it say that where rent to rent company take over the running of property it can not pass its legal liability on to the property landlord the government have amend the bill to reverse that decision which will mean that landlord can be fin even in case where rent to rent company or similar have without the landlord knowledge be ask by tenant to illegally sub let property accord to datum from direct line one in renter admit to sub let part of the home in which they live of whom do not disclose it to their landlord and three quarter do not review their exist lease agreement to determine whether sub letting be permit the amendment would deal with the main concern associate with the use of rent to rent company it would address the problem of landlord and other who willingly hide behind such company to let property while avoid liability for rent repayment order without penalise those who be innocent victim of such company welcome and recognise the fact that the government have see sense and table their own amendment mirror my propose new clause in the form of propose government new clause therefore withdraw propose new clause amendment and in my name be about court reform as have be discuss amendment will require the secretary of state to publish review of the operation of residential possession proceeding before determine the commencement date for the provision of chapter of part reform to the justice system be vital for tenant and landlord to be able to enforce their right when section be rightly end the law society have warn that the court be vastly overstretch possession claim and the eviction process can take many month sometimes more the bill may lead to an increase in contest hearing in the short term as landlord that would previously have use no fault provision will instead have to prove fault the government should outline how it intend to manage increase demand on the court and what additional resource it will put in place to deal with exist backlog datum from the ministry of justice show that it take mean average of almost week between private landlord make legitimate possession claim to repossession happen under section procedure the ministry of justice note timeliness figure be high than the legal guideline it be not acceptable that where tenant be commit antisocial behaviour fellow tenant and neighbour be expect to wait over half year before the problem be resolve as say in my opening speech we be explore expedite possession for serious antisocial behaviour claim be happy to work with my hon friend on how we go about that and ensure that it happen before these reform be fully implement the minister will find in this part of my speech we will be agree vehemently although the latter part of my speech might not be so agreeable be grateful to he for his intervention always welcome the opportunity to work with he likewise in the case of rent arrear it can not be acceptable to have system that allow rent arrear to continue to build for seven month the amendment would make good on the government commitment that the justice system be fully prepared for the impact of the end of section again be grateful that the government have decide to accept the point in principle and introduce proposed government new clause which mirror my amendment which be support by so many colleague therefore withdraw amendment propose new clause the repeal of requirement for selective licensing under my name would remove the ability of local housing authority to designate area as subject to selective licensing the bill provide the secretary of state with the power to develop new property portal that all landlord would have to join to demonstrate to prospective tenant that the property they rent meet all require standard it would be effectively national licensing scheme as selective licensing deal only with management quality and not property standard the change in the bill be likely to do more than selective licensing to improve property since council will be able to use the portal to access information on all private rent property and landlord operate in their area and in view of plan for decent home standard for the sector local selective licensing scheme will be make redundant in wales the introduction of landlord registration lead to the end of almost all selective licensing so it be unlikely that local authority would pursue costly and complex scheme in future take on board the minister comment in his opening remark selective licensing be an additional cost to landlord in addition to the property portal and redress scheme landlord should not have to be regulate twice and pay twice for much the same thing propose new clause would scrap selective licensing scheme for private rent housing when the property portal go live have both would not enhance protection for tenant but merely be duplication scrap they would remove an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and cost for landlord be grateful for the minister opening remark will take the government at their word that the dispatch box commitment to conduct review of selective licensing will take place at the early opportunity my new clause would enable court to consider hearsay evidence during the course of proceeding for possession on the ground of antisocial behaviour it be vital that when section end swift and effective action can be take against tenant commit antisocial behaviour who cause misery for so many neighbour and fellow tenant to support this the government have change the wording of the discretionary ground to repossess property due to tenant antisocial behaviour ground they clarify that any behaviour capable of cause nuisance or annoyance can lead to eviction previously it be behaviour likely to cause problem however that be not the true problem the current problem which be not deal with by the bill be that the main evidence of nuisance be provide by neighbour as they be close to the person involve the change to the definition of nuisance do not alter the fact that evidence of behaviour need to be provide and that will still come from neighbour however in so many instance neighbour be reluctant to attend court and give evidence in part because the slow speed of the court system mean that they will be force to live near the person that they have report or help to evict for several month afterwards well solution would be to allow landlord to use evidence of problematic behaviour that be provide by neighbour complain by text or email to the landlord or the let agency this evidence be not currently admissible and the court can not give sufficient weight to it when decide whether the tenant be commit antisocial behaviour this amendment would allow for such evidence to be use by the court in the negotiation and discussion that we have in the run up to this debate the minister department and his civil service team be extremely helpful in highlight civil procedure rule part in relation to circumstance in which notice of intention to rely on hearsay evidence be not require again the comment make by the minister be welcome although hope his department will follow this up with the ministry of justice therefore withdraw new clause amendment cover house of multiple occupancy relate specifically to student this would mean that the ground for possession for student property could also be use for property occupy by one or two student which would not otherwise have be consider as hmos end fix term tenancy will be problematic for the student housing market it would be problematic for the whole bill which operate on yearly cycle from one academic year to another although the government have recognise that by allow fix term agreement to continue in purpose build student accommodation it will not apply as understand it to traditional off street private rent housing often rent to those in their second or third year of study this be concern share by many in the industry and indeed by the levelling up housing and communities committee which have note currently the proposal be to include this part of the prs in the tenancy reform but we conclude that abolish fix term contract could make letting to student considerably less attractive to private landlord as the student market mirror the academic year and benefit greatly from month fix tenancy hope that have quote the select committee report accurately government amendment to the bill make at committee stage establish new ground for possession ground to protect the student housing market this be to be welcome it will ensure that landlord can guarantee that most student property will be available for each academic year but it will not protect all student housing the new ground will cover only house of multiple occupation it will not apply to those property occupy by one or two student this oversight would be rectify by my propose amendment again thank the government for recognise this and introduce their own amendment and which have address that problem as come to my concluding remark at last wish to make some comment on amendment which have not be select order have be listen carefully to what the hon gentleman have be say he have range of amendment and it be perfectly in order for he to speak to those but it be not in order for he to speak to amendment because it have not be select not only have it not be select for division but it have not be select for debate there might be general point to which he could make reference but he may not speak to amendment thank you madam deputy speaker for be so generous in your explanation on that the problem that see with this bill be that while the intent to remove section be good and necessary one yes it have take time to get to this point it be not one that those who have sign my amendment have ever object to the principle that explain why the amendment have be so widely support be that there must be some leeway around ensure that fix term tenancy can remain indeed they still remain in certain instance within the student market my hon friend be make powerful speech do he agree that it be in renter interest more than anything else to be able to agree tenancy long than six month in order to have security of tenure if they have young family they will not want ground such as sale to get in the way my hon friend be right to make that point in essence the bill forbid contract be agree with date on which the tenant would have to leave the property the noble lord hannan of kingsclere point out in february in the other place that language matter in politic and tendentious phraseology have consequence how have we reach the point where the expiry of contract freely enter into by two party at the end of its term be now widely refer to as an eviction let alone no fault report house of lords february vol to be clear the bill will make it illegal to sign fix term tenancy the lack of clarity when describe the end of contract have mean that we be now term simple cessation of contract as no fault eviction who be at fault when previously agree contract come to an end at future date no one believe that there be way to retain fix term tenancy and scrap section will the hon gentleman concede that although in principle it be perfectly possible to imagine scenario where the tenant and landlord mutually agree to set length of tenancy the reality be that because so many tenant be rush for so few property the amount of free will that the tenant have in sign up to that contract be not very great the idea of its be mutually agreeable be rather more suspect than the hon gentleman suggest come at it from different angle we be heap so many rule and regulation on people and make thing so difficult they be leave the market as result this be one of the pioneer policy of thatcher bring in the idea of the free market in property and ensure that million of people across the country could realise the social value of have buy to let property on long term basis the hon lady will not agree with do not think that we agree on very much that be okay it be good to be able to debate the issue especially in this chamber we must be honest about this remove fix term tenancy be essentially the state tell individual what they can and can not do with their own private property it be conceivable to remove section while retain fix term tenancy have say that the conservatives have long pride ourselves on be the party of free market and we should keep that in mind when we vote later we be send completely the wrong message with dire consequence for future level of housing supply we be make an enormous mistake which will reduce long term let in favour of short term let and result in many property be take off the rental market would hate to be back here have to repeat the figure that give at the start of my remark in there be eight people for every one property now there be and say that the number be go up and up fear that as consequence of the bill that will happen the hon gentleman seem to be in favour of abolish section but then give landlord the right to bring in fix term tenancy which end with section notice if the landlord choose therefore section would not be abolish would it it would be figment of our imagination here because in practice it would never be deliver with his proposal the hon gentleman be right to make that point and he have far great expertise in this area than but be say that we can retain fix term tenancy scrap section and amend other part of the bill there be breach of contract indeed we could make notice period long know that the department discuss that idea when this be moot after the election we could scrap section but increase the notice period for an eviction those be way we could do it but to throw the baby out with the bathwater and to become so restrictive on someone private property be problem people go into the buy to let market to let their property out but unfortunately think this bill will have the opposite impact push people out of the market who will no long want to deal with the hassle my hon friend be make fantastic speech and commend he for all of his effort on the bill one of the challenge be that sometimes our thinking about this issue be constrain to for example metropolitan area he and both represent rural constituency that be really affect by short term holiday let and the unintended consequence of this bill be that landlord will be push towards use those because the rule and regulation will become so tight and constrain on long term landlord do he agree my hon friend be absolutely right to raise that point and it come back to the question of try to incentivise long term let over term let in rural constituency in the south west we face rise tide of short term let however we be not legislate on the basis of our own respective constituency but on nationwide approach we should look very carefully at other country and other example of where thing have go so badly wrong through sometimes the simple tinkering of housing legislation scotland on rent control might be one and finland or berlin might be another they be example of thing have be get horribly wrong have be listen very carefully to an excellent contribution as always from my hon friend they be lucky to have he in totnes far to the intervention from our hon friend the member for the cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown be my hon friend say that the irony of this debate be that we be effectively legislate to no fault evict tenant because we be push landlord out of the market through this legislation can he back that up with any more evidence that he have hear in his deliberation while create this excellent speech my hon friend be absolutely right will use my constituency as an example have see significant decline in the number of long term let over the last four year period they be go straight into short term let at far great cost make rent totally unaffordable and leave we to come up with innovative way to supply the correct amount of rental property for people who live and work in south devon think that be also reflect in east devon in yeovil in somerset and be sure in the cotswolds will finish by say that be grateful for the work parliament have do on this at no time do think the government have drag their foot at no time do think they have try to block by virtue of table quite so many amendment be probably responsible for some of that hold up and for that apologise ultimately however it come down to belief in whether we be overreach feel that this bill be overreach there be way we can help to ensure that the right of tenant and landlord be enshrine and balanced but remove fix term tenancy be step too far for it will be significantly negative for the future rental market and will unfortunately have to vote against third reading the renters reform bill have the potential to bring much need security and safety to renter yet amendment to water it down bring forward in committee and even on report be backward step that will significantly undermine the bill intent as an mp with one of the large student population in the country be all too aware that student be experience housing crisis on top of cost of living crisis we have see landlord ask student renter for guarantor as well as for deposit of up to of their annual rent the criterion for which be that the guarantor must own uk property that requirement have an impact on the accessibility to working class student of private rent sector accommodation at their university it also have an impact on the ability of care leaver and those estranged from their family to access high education altogether as well as that of international student who do not have family member with property in the uk to mitigate that have table new clause which seek to end one of the most illogical part of the rental process guarantor scheme the expectation that despite enter into legal contract that outline the responsibility of the landlord and the tenant nominate individual take responsibility for fulfil the contract seem to undermine the purpose of the contract itself my new clause seek to tackle financial pressure on student support the amendment table by my hon friend the member for sheffield central paul blomfield to stop landlord from sign up tenant month before an academic year which create an arm race for student let we must also consider those who have come through the care system or have become estranged from their parent for whom live at home have never be an option if student do not know guarantor who own house in the uk they may be stick pay extra to private company pay six month rent or more up front or be unable to rent at all guarantor be not expect for most people of the same age who be not student so why be there this discrepancy for student an international postgraduate student at leeds university tell my only viable option be use the guarantor service housing hand which cost an additional pound month on top of rent and bill be phd student receive the ukri minimum stipend which be pay monthly the cost of live for food and rent alone be already difficult on this stipend and during final week before the stipend be pay each month often struggle to maintain healthy and balanced diet due to financial strain this be not only demoralise but effect my academic progress on physical level as be often hungry and unable to afford fresh fruit and vegetable which be staple of my diet it may not sound like much but not have to pay for this guarantor service could make considerable difference to my overall wellbee on monthly basis as this money could instead be use on fresh food research conduct by student from the centre for homelessness impact find that just of university provide help on rent guarantor that even few provide rent guarantor service for student and that as university themselves face financial issue such service will become more unlikely rent as student be already an uphill struggle we know for example that student accommodation price have increase by since and information from the national union of students uk show we that two in five student have consider drop out because of the cost of rent and bill when we be try to encourage people to attend our world lead institution which strengthen the skill potential of our country workforce why do we put up so many barrier our university be the uk strong soft power international student in particular be leave with nothing but bad choice they must either find uk guarantor or pay six month rent or more up front to their landlord as one student recently relay to the all party parliamentary group on student international student often face more challenge than home student we have hear story of student pay month of rent upfront only to find out they have be scamme and the place they think they would secure do even exist we have one case where international student pay whole year rent in advance only to find out their landlord go bankrupt while they eventually get their money back the stress and uncertainty they go through be unbearable the bill be welcome opportunity to rectify so many of the scandal in the private rented sector yet there have clearly be continued and concerted campaign to force the government to create an unprecedented two tier rental market in which student would be at the mercy of section eviction that other tenant would be protect from refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as be the owner of single residential flat that be let out simply want to say that in housing policy we must always try to strike balance between the legitimate interest and right of tenant and those of landlord not all of whom be large corporation by any manner of mean and not of all whom make any great profit from those premise they often operate at quite small margin but who be necessary part of the whole eco structure equally have serve in local government for many year be conscious of the pressure that unwarranted eviction can place upon family and then upon local authority which have to pick up their housing duty towards those family believe that the government be do their level well in the bill to get the right balance as far as that overall picture be concern want to speak in particular to government new clause we have already hear some rehearsal of the logic behind the new clause and the concern about whether it will cause delay to the abolition of section eviction as well as concern about the pressure on the county court it be in that context and wear my hat as chair of the justice committee that want to flag up to the house the inquiry that the justice committee be currently undertake and receive evidence on in relation to the work of the county court particularly welcome the minister commitment of million to be transfer to the ministry of justice to carry out the assessment because of course like local government and housing the ministry of justice be an unprotected department it be also downstream department either through the court service or other part of its work it pick up many thing that have go wrong whether elsewhere in our public service or in society as whole the court system include the civil court and the county court in particular be very much part of that great deal of social problem go through the county court and we know from all the evidence we be receive that those county court be under very great pressure as such support the new clause but not because want to delay the introduction of the reform to the housing procedure that be envisage or the abolition of section eviction as they currently exist although as my hon friend the member for totnes anthony mangnall say there may be other way of strike the right balance that we could look at do not want to delay that reform but we have to be frank and open about the pressure it will potentially put on what be already strained county court system if we be go to make those reform this apply to both party we need to will the mean to make sure the county court work as efficiently as they should do for all party whether landlord or tenant that be the topic that want to refer to some of the evidence on the overall picture base on some submission that have be publish on the justice committee website be that of very troubled situation as far as delay in the county court be concern there be delay in two area that be germane to this debate the first be the time it take to see possession action through the court and the second be enforcement and particularly delay in get bailiff appointment where necessary and then get the enforcement carry out there be real difficulty with both it be fair to say that those difficulty vary across the country but especially in many urban area there be considerable pressure that be particularly acute in london and the south east where my constituency be although the majority of those submission come from landlord they be base on datum that think be accept and verify whichever way one look at this issue the large agents representation group represent the large letting and estate agent in london and the south east it have collect deal of datum and it say in its submission that on average the county court be take approximately work day to process repossession claim from initial enquiry to decision be give some of the other datum that we get do not cover the whole of that process which be why it be important to have the overall picture that come to an average of about week which do not include the enforcement time afterwards that be unacceptable on both side of the equation so we need the resource to put that right midland heart housing association base in birmingham well establish register of social landlord say that typically possession claim may take minimum of month and sometimes up to month to conclude the hyde group another major social housing provider say that the current level of delay be extreme and unacceptable number of those submission also highlight the serious delay in bailiff execute warrant of possession when they be obtain under the current process of course that be not unique to possession hearing as have be observe in some case possession hearing proceed with more speed than other part of the county court process but they be still painfully slow in many area for example we have have pretty clear evidence that there have be an increase in possession action of roughly from the equivalent quarter in before the pandemic there be obviously drop off during the pandemic itself for number of reason and as have be observe the county court have do well to pick up the backlog that be create during the pandemic we ought to pay tribute to everybody in the county court not just the judge but the office staff who have work phenomenally hard to try to turn that situation around hope all member of this house will try to find the time to visit their local county court and see the work that be do by people on the admin side who be often not the well pay people in the public sector by any mean indeed recruitment and retention of staff in the county court be itself real challenge which mean that we must have continue investment in those court hope the assessment that the lord chancellor carry out under the term of new clause will help we to trigger great investment and make the case for fund the county court much well than it have be for many year under government dare say of all political complexion to support that simply refer to some of the word of the former lord chief justice lord burnett of maldon he repeatedly tell we when he give his annual evidence to the justice committee that there be problem with recruit full time district judge the condition of the estate and very importantly the fact that the county court rely almost entirely upon paper base system to carry out its work the crown court and the high court have be substantially digitise his majesty courts and tribunals service have an ambitious digitisation programme but it have run slowly behind its original intention and many of the propose portal on the civil side be not yet in operation the net result be that we be work on an analogue system in the county court which deal with about of the civil claim and overwhelmingly the vast bulk of possession action to make this bill work we be go to have to invest in the system that enable possession where appropriate to be address with the proper safeguard to tenant delay have also be cause this be something the government have to take on board through the withdrawal of legal aid in housing case when we talk to the association of his majesty district judges and other who give evidence to we we repeatedly hear that with more and more people appear in person not just tenant in possession action but very often small landlord who may also not be able to afford the cost of solicitor hearing with litigant in person take much long they have to have more explain to they and the hearing take long the judge have to draft the order which would normally be draft by the lawyer therefore the productivity particularly of the district judge be reduce they can deal with few case in sit day that be another reason why we need such level of investment to quote the evidence to we from the association of his majesty district judges the county court have long be the poor relation of the justice system when it come to technology the other problem be with the recruitment of salaried full time district judge who be the vast bulk of the people who carry out this work it be an moj issue and as much as anything this require make the work condition of those judge attractive and make sure that salary be competitive not that that problem do not exist at the high level of the judiciary unless we have that unless we have proper representation in these action so that time be save by lawyer hone the issue and enable judge to deal with case more quickly and unless we have sufficient district judge recruit to hear the case we will not achieve the much swifter resolution of these issue that the bill seek to achieve there be also the issue of enforcement the interim review of the structure of civil court lead by lord justice briggs as he then be describe enforcement as the achilles heel of the civil justice system or at least of the county court it be fair to say that since the government have make serious investment in his majesty courts and tribunals service reform programme progress have be make but it be fair to say that the ambition the lord chancellor set out in of transform our justice system have not yet be achieve in the county court hope that we can use this debate as signal that if we be go to achieve the policy objective which think the house be broadly agree on we have to will the mean to the court system because we can not have efficient execution of policy without give the mean to the court system that carry it out legal right be they the right of the tenant or of the landlord be only as good as their ability to access the court to uphold those right in timely fashion sadly we not yet able to achieve that finally there many great people do work in housing law be it in the court or behind the scene one of the great contributor to housing law in this country recently retire from the bench his honour jan luba kc may be know to some member as one of the titan of housing law both as lawyer and as judge jan recently retire as the designate civil judge for london he have oversight over all london county court he have probably do more for housing law than anyone else have come across hope that in retirement he will speak frankly about the pressure that his colleague who be still work be under that be my plea if we want to make this bill work we have to use the assessment under new clause as evidence of the need for sustained investment in our civil justice system it be four month since the bill conclude in committee and five year since the government promise to legislate for renter right so start by say that it be totally unacceptable that it have take so long for the renters reform bill to be on report it be deplorable for nearly million renter to have be issue with section eviction notice in england since the government promise to abolish they accord to recent yougov datum renter have be badly let down by this delay and aspect of the legislation before we continue to let they down my amendment would require energy performance certificate for property to be provide to the database operator and for the detail to be record in the portal this simple amendment would make big difference it would recognise that information be power and allow tenant to know whether the home they be about to rent will be damp and leaky or warm and efficient amendment also build on the exist rule that require epc to be commission before property be put on the market and for they to be clearly display in advert in commercial medium fairness and logic demand that renter should be able easily to compare energy efficiency information when consider property to rent cold and damp home can end up cost renter dearly both in high energy bill and health and wellbeing impact renter in cold and damp home run an increase risk of problem associate with mould and of health condition such as asthma and heart disease as well as of poor mental health we all know that the uk have some of the leaky home in europe and that tenant be particularly expose to high global gas price because the private rented sector be the least energy efficient of any tenure staggering quarter of renting household be live in fuel poverty today so urgent action be essential to improve standard across the sector and to ensure that all renter have warm and decent home in which to live it therefore beggar belief that the prime minister announce last september that he be scrap the requirement to upgrade energy efficiency standard in private rent property to epc grade that be despite it be essential to deliver on our climate and fuel poverty target that upgrade would save tenant more than year even at so call normal price accord to the climate change committee as well as harm renter that regressive move be also contrary to the wish of landlord of whom be in favour of strict energy efficiency regulation my amendment seek to tackle the crippling private rent that so many people be pay in brighton and hove in which my constituency rest new study of more than renter find that tenant in the city be spend scandalous of their pay on rent make it the most expensive city in england in which to rent as the bill stand the measure on rent increase be wholly inadequate they rely on resource intensive and time consume appeal process that could even see tenant bad off at the end of it because the tribunal would have the power to impose high rent than the one the tenant be appeal that be frankly outrageous and go directly against the promise make in the secretary of state white paper which say we will prevent the tribunal increase rent beyond the amount landlord initially ask for when they propose rent increase amendment would simply make good that break promise by ensure that the rent payable after tribunal determination can be no high than the rent initially impose by the landlord in the notice serve on the tenant one would have think that that would be pretty straightforward give that the landlord be propose that rent level in the first place that must surely be the upper limit of what the tribunal can determine the secretary of state obviously understand that principle since he put in in his own white paper the removal of this commitment in the bill show the government be determined to bend over backwards to tip the balance of power even far in favour of landlord in short amendment would get rid of what seem to be deliberate disincentive to discourage tenant from use the process that be suppose to protect they from unfair rent hike in the absence of national system for rent control with local flexibility which be what we really need amendment be modest rebalancing of the rent tribunal process and would welcome the minister consideration and response in sum up the debate there be limited time in the debate but very much support the amendment seek to prohibit eviction within two year of the beginning of tenancy where the landlord want to sell or move family in as the bill stand tenant can be serve two month notice just four month after tenant have move in make mockery of ministerial claim to improve security of tenure also sincerely hope that ministers will accept amendment which address the deeply concern fact that the notice period for eviction under the new landlord ground be just two month this amendment extend it to four month in recognition of the huge difficulty many people face in find somewhere suitable and affordable to rent when they be evict which as we know be major cause of homelessness have never be landlord but have be private renter and greatly welcome some of the measure in the bill as they would have help and other private renter lot be offer some extraordinary property when be private renter remember that one have dog mess all over the floor while another in elephant and castle have bare wire hang out of the wall and gas cooker hang off the wall welcome the extension of the decent home standard to the private rent sector through this legislation and it be strike how little controversy there have be about that give how big deal it be the proportion of private rent home that have major category hazard in they have already come right down from when we come into office in to just now but that be still too high and it be three time high than in the social rent sector so it be great that today we be press on with fix this the government amendment we be debate today be welcome they strike good balance between the interest of tenant and of landlord for example new clause which make the commencement of the end of no fault eviction dependent on county court be ready be sensible the slow recovery of the court from the covid backlog have be frustrating and there be much wide question about how we can get rid of old fashioned court practice that slow thing down my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill chair of the justice committee make important point about the paper base nature still of lot of what go on there however lot of good idea can be wreck if we do not get the implementation just right and my hon and learn friend also mention that it currently take about week from commencement to possession which be much too long although agree with what we be do here in term of no fault eviction it be big deal and it be right and reasonable that those who let out property do at least know that they can rely on slick and well function court process before we bring this measure in even those on the opposition front bench say the court be recover from the pandemic rather than be fully recover so think they recognise that up to point as well the government have make range of other sensible reform in the new clause before we to ensure that there be fairness for landlord as well as tenant include new clause which give those who let out property some confidence in the first six month there be the new student ground as well and note that even landlord group such as the national residential landlords association be now say we should get on with this legislation so think this be about right large number of government amendment be before we today but the overall effect be to get good balance in the legislation know some have concern about the end of section but many country have similar system and the sky have not fall in germany austria denmark switzerland and the netherlands all ban no fault eviction and they have high share of private renting than we and in the us and canada state include california and quebec do the same and the sky have not fall in there either even scotland have have this since and again although it have do some other thing that be pretty unwise in term of rent control the sky have not fall in landlords will still be able to cite lot of reason to ensure that they can get their property back indeed my hon friend the member for dover mrs elphicke who be not in her place suggest that perhaps there be still too many but think it be essential that people can get their property back the end of section change the balance bit recognise that it be no small thing to ask people to move home there be more people live in the private rent sector with child these day and it be hugely disruptive to have to move remember how in place that be rent we be all move out because the landlord be supposedly go to do massive work but he end up instal about square metre of linoleum and let the place out again for the same rent it be just huge amount of disruption to no particular end for those in more vulnerable position than be it be not small thing to be ask to move home so by end section but still enable landlord to get control of their property when they need it we be strike the right balance the amendment that we be consider be not the end of the story feel lot of sympathy for the comment make by the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts he make some important point about estate regeneration also have some sympathy for the hon member for twickenham munira wilson who make some important point about defence estate and the like on the one hand understand the concern of my hon friend the member for totnes anthony mangnall but on the other hand also understand the concern of other such as my hon friend the member for dover who worry that it be too easy to evict people it be not easy to get the balance right but in put forward this suite of carefully judge amendment the government have do that the bill will make it fair and more secure for people in the private rented sector but it also treat landlord fairly think that be fair balance while respect the view of the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill who raise some valid point about the county court system and the pressure on it as someone represent large number of private renter must nevertheless express my concern and share those raise by the shadow minister and other about the government failure to deliver on their promise on no fault eviction rise as chair of the all party parliamentary group for student to comment specifically on the proposal in relation to student to support new clause table by my hon friend the member for leeds north west alex sobel and to speak to amendment which stand in my name student form substantial part of the private rent sector back in july the all party parliamentary group organise meeting to ensure that their view be hear we bring together people from different nation of the uk and from all part of the country the minister sadly he be not currently in his place would have find it useful because it highlight number of issue in the bill that have not be properly think through have discuss with the minister the issue that come out of our meeting and be grateful to he for have find that time but want to share some reflection at this point in the bill progress first on the decision to extend ground for eviction from purpose build student accommodation to house in multiple occupation and potentially to other student renter there be mixed view across the country some be worried that exempt student make they more attractive to less scrupulous landlord as potentially second class less protect tenant other though be concerned that give student the same protection as other renter would force landlord to leave the student market with that point make by landlord in area where there be significant pressure on the housing market overall we reach the same view as the select committee on balance the exemption be probably right but it need to be keep under review there be however wide problem with the whole approach to student in the bill it seem that the government have approach student with one size fit all model they be undergraduate aged to live away from the parental home from the first time and live there during term time only however student at our meeting be at pain to point out that they be not homogeneous group there be mature student who be rent in their home city and need to be there all the time and student with family many course do not start in september and be not on the cycle on which the government amendment be premise there be postgraduate teach programme on different long cycle there be postgraduate research student on full time programme over several year who be like any young professional there be mixed household of student and non student particularly where group of friend form and perhaps one member graduate discuss all those variation with the minister be glad to see he back in the chamber and his view be that any atypical student would simply not be subject to the exemption partly because these issue have not be think through properly that might be in their favour because they will have great protection or it might leave they out in the cold because landlord will find they less attractive within the student market again that emphasise the need to keep the impact of the student proposal under close review as the minister resume his seat will move to my amendment which raise further issue that he refer to the cycle of student tenancy which have discuss with he and on which he be sympathetic when some of we be student undergraduate would start university in september settle in and make friendship group and towards the end of the academic year after easter they would start look for accommodation for the subsequent year we have see landlord drive arm race as my hon friend the member for leeds north west refer to it in which they have pressure student ever early in the year to enter into contract for the subsequent academic year it be now the norm in many part of the country that student start course in september be put under pressure by landlord the following month to enter into contract for the following year that force they to pay substantial deposit at point in their life when they already have significant additional cost it also force they into joint tenancy with group of people who they might discover later in the year be probably not who they want to live with in the subsequent year appeal to landlord to step out of the contract into which they enter be invariably reject as the government proposal be to regulate on the basis of that tenancy cycle my proposition be that we try to make that cycle work well by say that designate student contract should not start soon than march of the year in which student will take occupation in september that would be in the interest of tenant for the reason that all of we who represent student will know set define starting point will also end the arm race in the interest of landlord the tendency that the hon gentleman refer to be not new my daughter who graduate in and therefore start in be already under that pressure he be right that for lot of young people it be incredibly difficult to find group of people they want to live with the follow year within month of arrive at university his proposal be commendable and hope the government be listen thank the hon lady for her intervention it do vary in different part of the country but the way in which it have come early and early each year to the ludicrous position where student be be force into contract for the subsequent year almost at the moment they start their first year clearly need to be address as say have discuss this issue with the minister when we talk about it he seem sympathetic so hope it be an issue we can address as the bill progress before start my remark refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests my amendment amendment to all refer to the protection from eviction act have raise this issue with the government for the past two year after one of my constituent who be lecturer in law at bristol university come to with his concern to be fair to the government the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities the hon member for kensington felicity buchan have meeting with that group of academic but then hear nothing which be little bit disappointing have just this afternoon receive reply from the minister thank he for that but it be date yesterday and only send to today will look at it very carefully but it be still important that raise here what have to say there be two part to amendment which relate to the law on harassment of residential occupier at the moment the law be complex and confusing particularly for lay people and difficult to enforce have glance over the response from the minister the government believe that there be currently enough power of enforcement as understand it the act be quite unknown local authority and the police do not know enough about it wonder how we can work in that space to ensure that any unintended consequence bring in by the new legislation will not allow rogue landlord or those who do not want to do the right thing and refer they to other piece of legislation first the amendment would change the law so that everyone who be harass residential occupier to try to get they to move out of the property be subject to the same law currently if criminal landlord be harass the tenant the law be fairly clear however it might be another individual who be harass the tenant to get they to move out in this case the local authority have to try to find out whether the person do the harassing be an agent act for the rogue landlord there be also often deliberate obscurity about the identity of the landlord investigate the relationship between individual to establish their precise legal relationship be time consume and unnecessary where the aim of the legislation be to protect residential occupier from harassment the amendment change the law to make enforcement easy for local authority the change will not affect the position of landlord they will continue to be subject to the same law it be only the local authority that can prosecute this offence and it would still need to prove that rogue landlord their agent or any other person know or have reasonable cause to believe that their action would have the result of cause the occupier to leave the other thing that the amendment would do be clarify the law currently if rogue landlord interfere with service that be reasonably require for the occupation of the premise as household that can constitute harassment however it be not clearly state what those service be can think of essential service such as electricity cut the water off or even change the lock so it be important that we take that into consideration we be not talk about decent landlord as have always make very clear it be about get to those landlord who be clearly not do the right thing as say it be not clearly state what the service be amendment set out list of such service include water gas and electricity as well as access to electronic communication network and service as define in section of the communications act amendment deal with three issue first the law on whether certain occupier be protect by the legislation on illegal eviction be very complex and it can be very difficult to establish that be because some occupier for example those who live with the landlord be exclude from the protection in the law and can therefore be evict without notice or court order that create an incentive for sham arrangement whereby rogue landlord might pretend to live with tenant to circumvent the protection in the protection from eviction act the amendment reverse the burden of proof place it on the landlord who must establish that an occupier be not protect by the law it be base on the idea that everyone have the basic protection of the law unless they be in an exclusionary category for good reason the presumption should be that they be protect secondly one of the big problem face by residential occupier and prosecutor be identify the landlord the current law encourage behaviour that obscure the identity of landlord and the bill do not address that propose new section would amend the act so that there be rebuttable presumption in any action under that act that the person to whom the residential occupier pay rent be the landlord of the property the word other payment in respect of occupation of dwelling be take from the housing act there have be extensive complaint from local authority and other that police ignorance of the law do not assist and at time obstruct the effective prosecution of offence under the act propose new section would amend the act to require police officer who become aware of potential offence of illegal eviction and harassment to notify the relevant local authority it also add power for police to assist the local authority in its investigation and prosecution of offence under the act amendment seek to amend the housing and planning act it would lower the standard of proof require for make rent repayment order relate to illegal eviction or harassment in other rent repayment application prove the offence be much more straightforward for example the landlord may not have licence prove illegal eviction or harassment be considerably more challenging for applicant and as result of that difficulty application for repayment order for breach of the act often fail the amendment would bring that test into line with the test use by the county court to determine damage for illegal eviction or harassment all this be pretty technical and legal stuff that take up because think that my constituent have very fair point the minister have now send response for which thank he will study it carefully in decide whether want to pursue this issue and whether the amendment should be table in the other place rise to speak in support of new clause which stand in my name but before do so will say little about the bill more generally legislative reform of private renting be urgently need my constituency be in the eye of the storm of the housing crisis and every year since the situation have worsen the waiting list for genuinely affordable social home have become long the number of people live in temporary accommodation have become high and private sector rent have continue to spiral despite many promise the government have delay action for far too long private renter housing campaigner charity and member from across this house be unite in their support for bold reform of private renting but now after year of delay we see government unable to deliver the effective and urgently need reform that be promise because they be too weak to face down their own back benchers at the heart of the matter be the urgent need for an end to section eviction which have be call for since the debate on the housing and planning act section be the basis of insecurity in private renting because it give landlord the ability to evict tenant for no reason at all time and again have see in my constituency how section be use egregiously to ratchet up rent and to stop tenant complain about basic repair or safety issue such as damp and mould because section eviction do not need to be justify with reason all the power be in the hand of the landlord tenant live with the daily threat that they will be tell to leave their home with all that that entail such as have to find new home as rent cost continue to rise in housing crisis characterise by an acute shortage of genuinely affordable social housing private renting be form of tenure on which million of people rely they must have degree of security so that they can put down root know that their child will be able to remain at the local school and live without insecurity and the constant fear that they may have to move section be destabilising for family and community it be therefore beyond disappointing that the bill will not result in an immediate end to section and that the secretary of state can not give date for when it will end the reason for the delay be the shocking mess that the government have make of the court system my constituent who use to be able to attend lambeth county court now have to travel to shoreditch because the court be close in when we challenge the closure of lambeth county court on the ground that it would involve much more complicated and costly journey for constituent face eviction who wish to attend court we be promise digital reform of the court service we be promise investment in infrastructure to make hearing accessible to anybody who have to attend court and to ease the complexity of the distance and journey time be increase but no such investment have be forthcoming legal aid lawyer in my constituency who work in the court speak of the chaos the crumble infrastructure and the overburden workload fall on staff yet this be the excuse today for why section eviction can not be bring to an end new clause which table arise from tragedy that happen to family in my constituency their son first year university student have sign tenancy agreement on house for his second year in common with parent of university student across the country his parent be the guarantor for his tenancy but before their son have finish his first year at university and the tenancy have even start he tragically die by suicide face with one of the most terrible tragedy that any of we can imagine these bereaved parent be then pursue by their late son let agent for the rent he would have owe on tenancy that he would never take up write to the let agency several time on behalf of my constituent but it refuse to budge it maintain that contract be contract and that my constituent be liable as the guarantor so they would just have to pay surely we in this house can agree that contractual provision that financially penalise bereave parent for the suicide of their child be straightforwardly wrong after raise that case during prime minister question be contact by number of family who have sign guarantor agreement on similar contract but also by number of landlord and let agent who say that they do not use such clause in their tenancy and guarantor agreement this demonstrate that such clause be simply not necessary loss of rental income due to the death of tenant be an insurable risk for landlord and it should be matter for insurance not for bereaved guarantor be grateful to the minister for meet to discuss new clause but be baffle by the government response which be to suggest limit the obligation of bereaved guarantor to two month include during the propose six month minimum commitment at the start of new tenancy while two month rent be clearly preferable to six month or year worth of rent it be still quite literally financial penalty for the death of love one bereavement be one of the hard thing anyone can experience and the government should use the power at their disposal to provide comfort security and peace of mind to the bereaved so that they can focus on grieve the loss of their love one it be simply not fair for bereaved guarantor to be charge for the rent that their love one be no long alive to pay and it be not necessary because the loss of rental income due to the death of tenant be an insurable risk new clause would bring this practice to an end and give peace of mind to guarantor that should the unthinkable happen they will not have to find hundred or even thousand of pound as they grieve the minister have say that he will continue to reflect on this issue urge he to do the right thing and to accept new clause into the bill it be simple measure that would prevent anyone else from experience the additional distress that my constituent suffer when their son pass away this new clause have not be select for separate decision today but will continue to pursue this reform it be the right thing to do urge the government to look again at this issue it be reform that would cost the government nothing but it would give peace of mind to anybody face bereavement as my constituent have have to do that egregious landlord and let agency will not come after they for cost that they may not be able to afford at time when they need help support and comfort not additional financial penalty thank right hon and hon member for their contribution to the debate and for their ongoing engagement throughout the bill passage will respond to some of the issue raise during the debate but might not be able to respond to all of they in the time remain will start by address the point make by the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook and the amendment table by the opposition as say in my opening speech thank he and other on the labour front bench for their continue engagement and their support for the bill believe that we share the ambition to see the bill on the statute book as soon as possible new clause would extend awaab law to the private rent sector the tragic and avoidable death of two year old awaab ishak be the most shocking reminder of the danger of damp and mould be clear that no tenant should have to live in dangerous housing condition but our approach to tackle this issue must reflect the difference between the social and private rented sector awaab law be design for social housing most social landlord manage large portfolio and have dedicate repair and maintenance team enable they to tackle issue to specific timeframe in contrast the vast majority of private landlord own small number of property with of landlord have few than five property and own just one the bill take different and believe more suitable approach to ensure that private tenant have safe home it give council power to immediately fine private landlord up to if their property be dangerously unsafe it also introduce decent home standard for the first time and new mean of redress through the ombudsman we will publish statutory guidance for council on enforcement and we will explore how this guidance can strengthen the onus on private landlord to deal promptly with tenant complaint about hazard include for large institutional private landlord that may have resource similar to those of social landlord amendment which the hon gentleman speak to would remove section immediately upon royal assent this would mean there be no transition period as be currently plan leave no time at all for landlord let agent tenant group and local authority to adjust to the new system there would be no time to conclude the necessary secondary legislation leave the statute book confusing mess importantly without have the new possession ground in place amendment would prevent landlord from regain possession of their property even where they have legitimate reason to do so which the new ground reflect landlord could not repossess to sell their property or to deal effectively with antisocial behaviour or repeat rent arrear most concerningly of all temporary and supported accommodation would not have access to the critical new ground which would have an immediate impact by clog up those sector although it might seem appeal and sound good to say let just abolish it on royal assent amendment would create chaos in the sector it be far well for tenant and landlord alike if we ensure that the change happen in an orderly way for those reason ask the hon gentleman not to press his amendment amendment table by the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan and give voice today by the hon member for twickenham munira wilson seek to bring accommodation provide by the defence infrastructure organisation into scope of the decent home standard make it clear that everyone deserve safe and decent home none more so than the hero who serve in our armed force although of service family accommodation already meet the decent home standard bring such accommodation within scope could provide further safeguard to ensure that all service personnel and their family have home of the quality they deserve we therefore strongly agree with the intent of the amendment service family accommodation have unique feature however include significant portion be locate on secure military site where there will be issue around security and access for inspection this would create challenge in apply and enforce the decent home standard the government intend to ensure that service accommodation meet the decent home standard while recognise that work be need to determine the appropriate monitoring and report arrangement give the unique nature of this accommodation my department will therefore work closely with the ministry of defence to explore these challenge and how we can well ensure that there be strong safeguard for service personnel and their family that work effectively in practice assure the hon member for twickenham and for north shropshire that we be seriously consider this issue and that the minister for defence procurement and intend to meet the hon member for north shropshire in the come week to discuss these issue in more detail before the bill be in committee in the lords therefore ask she not to press her amendment new clause and amendment to table by my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton seek to extend the core blanket ban provision in chapter to care leaver be grateful to he for raise the important issue of care experience young people ability to rent home in the private rent sector the government have already reserve power in the bill to extend blanket ban provision to additional cohort in future should we find evidence that it be need this power could be use to extend the provision to care experienced people if evidence suggest that it would be effective help care leaver to make successful transition from care to independence be priority for this government and we recognise that care leaver can face significant barrier to secure and maintain affordable housing include provide guarantor or rent in advance we be already seek to improve care leaver access to housing as set out in the stable home build on love strategy which sit alongside exist duty owe to care leaver by local council as corporate parent furthermore we understand that at least council have pass motion grant care leaver the same protect characteristic status as other cohort under the equality act in their local area be happy to continue work with my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham to hear the challenge that care experienced people face and how we can make private rent accommodation more accessible to they can confirm to my hon friend that the measure to prohibit blanket ban on the basis that child will live with or visit person at property include foster child and in response to the hon member for twickenham kinship carer landlord and let agent will not be able to discriminate against potential tenant on the basis that they foster child no further legal provision be need to do this more broadly during this spending review we be invest over million in foster carer programme and foster carer recruitment and retention programme that be the large ever investment in foster in england for that reason ask my hon friend to withdraw his amendment new clause propose by my hon friend the member for dover mrs elphicke effectively require landlord to compensate tenant when use any possession ground find in schedule of the housing act within two year other than ground or ground while appreciate the intent behind my hon friend amendment do not agree that landlord should be make to pay compensation to tenant when they have legitimate reason to evict landlord look to move into or sell their property or deal with tenant in rent arrear may find themselves to be in financial difficulty too and the change propose by the amendment could exacerbate that amendment seek to tighten the breach of tenancy ground so that tenant can be evict if the tenancy breach impact the wellbeing of other tenant or neighbour or could cause material damage to the property beyond what would be cover by tenancy deposit as have indicate to my hon friend the member for dover previously be sympathetic to the intention behind her amendment but it could have adverse consequence for example significant breach of tenancy agreement such as sublet may not lead to an eviction if they be prove to not have material impact on other housemate or immediate neighbour be also concerned about the impact on exist contract sign between landlord and tenant on the basis that this ground would be available assure my hon friend that ground be discretionary mean that judge will consider whether the ground have be meet and whether the possession be reasonable in each case we therefore think it be unlikely that tenant would be evict for minor breach will seek to clarify in guidance when this ground ought to be use be happy to explore what more could be do in legislation to ensure tenant be not unfairly evict for minor and unfair breach to their tenancy agreement for those reason ask my hon friend to withdraw her amendment turn to propose new clause the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes set out deeply moving and tragic case in her consistency be grateful to she for meet yesterday to discuss the case new clause would prevent guarantor be hold liable for rent after tenant death the hon lady have campaign on the issue for some time and appreciate her work on it by move to system of periodic tenancy tenant and their estate will no long be lock in after the first six month in the event of bereavement the tenant representative would be able to serve two month notice to end the tenancy and end the guarantor liability attempt to hold guarantor liable for rent past the end of the tenancy would be in breach of the tenant fees act and landlord could be fin for do so be aware that our new six month term may mean guarantor be hold liable for long that be why we have commit to look at an exemption where tenant tragically die as discuss with hon lady yesterday so that notice can be serve in the usual way for that reason ask the hon lady to withdraw her amendment turn to the point make by my hon friend the member for totnes anthony mangnall in his speech he acknowledge that the government have accept not one but almost all his amendment regret that he still feel opposed to the bill overall but hope he will reconsider his position have listen to the debate and hear the significant change we have make he mention margaret thatcher reform of the her reform seek to smash disastrous system of sit tenant where landlord be block from move into or sell their home or be force to let their property below market rent our reform build on her reform landlords will still have mandatory right to move into or sell their home nothing in our bill introduce rent cap despite call from opposition party and the mayor of london five year ago the late james brokenshire as secretary of state for housing communities and local government promise that we would abolish section eviction eight month later every english member of this house stand on manifesto to abolish section in we publish the white paper into how we would reform the tenancy system in we bring forward this bill which give the white paper legislative form and today we have the opportunity to move forward bill that strike the right balance between security for tenant and fairness for landlord for tenant this bill abolishe section eviction and move to more flexible system of periodic tenancy for all it apply new decent home standard to the private rent sector for the first time and outlaws blanket ban on tenant with child or those on benefit it give renter legal right to request pet it also expand the homelessness prevention duty to protect vulnerable tenant together these change will give tenant the opportunity to put down root in their community their child in local school and to live in secure home for landlord the bill strengthen possession ground give landlord certainty that they can get their property back it provide strong protection in case of antisocial behaviour and repeat non payment of rent and protection for the student market and rural community tenant will have to give two month notice to leave tenancy instead of one and we be make improvement to the court system to ensure that they can properly support the new system the new private rent sector ombudsman will also help prevent issue escalate to the court offer quick and cheap resolution to dispute and the new property portal will provide one stop shop for landlord to understand requirement and to demonstrate compliance above all the bill deliver for landlord and tenant because it drive out the bad actor in the system that be what we aim to do to build sector that give tenant security and protection and landlord fairness not pit one against the other but work with both to drive out the bad actor this bill be the culmination of year of work in sector that have not see meaningful change in three decade

signify beg to move that the bill be now read the third time this bill be an opportunity for we to improve the life chance of million of private renter across the country and hope that we have also give reassurance to the million of good landlord who endeavour to provide home for those who rely on the private rent sector when the government set out their levelling up mission in as the levelling up minister feel this keenly we make clear commitment to halve the number of poor quality home by to restore sense of community local pride and belong especially in those place where it have be lose when housing be secure and safe it be the launch pad for rich and fulfil life and give people place they truly proud to call home this bill mark the big change to the sector in more than year rightly member have press the government to ensure that it strike the right balance improve the sector for all while ensure that no party be unduly burden either by cost or by process believe that the bill now strike that balance and be proud to have take it through the house as my first bill as minister should add that take it over hour before the beginning of the committee stage be an add excitement that shall not forget let again pay tribute to my predecessor my hon friend the members for walsall north eddie hughes and for redditch rachel maclean at this point invite the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas to intervene if she wish to do so be grateful to the minister as he know try to intervene early during his sum up speech merely want to pursue the point about rent tribunal that make in my initial intervention in the white paper the government say that they be go to prevent tribunal from increase rent beyond the amount that landlord initially ask for when they propose rent increase why have the government go back on that why do they now envisage scenario in which someone could go to tribunal and end up with high rent than the one against which they be appeal that be surely massive disincentive large rent increase should not be use as back door method of eviction but it be crucial that landlord be able to increase rent in line with market level to maintain investor confidence we have listen to concern and we think it fair that the tribunal be not limit when determine that market rent this mean that as the hon lady say the tribunal have the freedom to make full and fair decision and can continue to determine the market rent of property understand the hon lady concern but it be important that all our measure be proportionate and that we do not allow the tribunal to become overburden by too many complaint therefore think that this be necessary safeguard the minister be be very generous in give way be not the only person to have say that it should not be possible for rent to rise in these circumstance the government own white paper say it only short time ago wish that the minister would address the point about the disincentive if tenant know that by go to tribunal they could end up with high rent than the one against which they be appeal surely that will be massive disincentive obviously in number of area we have listen to the sector and move on from the white paper the hon lady point be legitimate but the reason the tribunal be able to set rent that be above the landlord initial request and to set market rent be that we want to ensure that it be not overburden with repeat request that challenge rent increase that be perfectly reasonable surely the whole point of tribunal be for the tribunal judge to set what he think be fair market price it might go up it might go down or it might stay the same but that be the whole point of tribunal entirely agree with my hon friend and that be why we have act in this way we have hear from member in all part of the house and thank they all for their contribution during the bill passage they have work collaboratively and diligently to ensure that this important legislation become law want to record my thank to all my official can not name they all but few of they be leah guy steph and ross as well as those in my private office team and the clerks thank member on both side of the house notably my hon friend the members for northampton south andrew lewer and for totnes anthony mangnall for all their work and of course thank those in the government whips office above all thank all the group that have have the pleasure of meeting as they represent the interest of both tenant and landlord across the wide sector hope that our colleague in the other place will take the collaborative approach that have be take in this house and will pass the bill with the speed that it now deserve to give certainty and security to landlord and tenant throughout the country let start by thank the clerks the house staff and the library specialist for facilitate our debate on the bill along with all the expert and external organisation that have engage extensively with we on it also put on record my thank to all hon member who have contribute to our proceeding at all stage particularly those who serve on the public bill committee especially thank my hon friend the members for weaver vale mike amesbury for westminster north ms buck for north tyneside mary glindon for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle for their forensic scrutiny of the bill provision and the considerable effort that they have make to strengthen it as whole offer my sincere thank to the minister for the manner in which he have approach our exchange on this important piece of legislation in be hand this as his first bill to take through the house he have be give an unenviable task to put it mildly but he have bear his trouble with good grace have very much appreciate the civil way in which he have engage with throughout and his effort within the severe constraint under which he be no doubt operate to make number of small but sensible improvement to the bill once again put on the record the thank of labour members to all those who have campaign tirelessly in many case over decade for reform private rent sector particularly thank all the organisation that have join labour over recent month in urge the government to amend the bill so that it level decisively the play field between landlord and tenant especially the that make up the renters reform coalition labour have consistently argue that the case for fundamentally reform the private rented sector be as watertight as they come state of affair in which more than million people in england not just the young and mobile but many old people and family with child live day in day out with the knowledge that they could be uproot from their home with little notice and minimal justification and where significant minority of they be force to live in substandard property for fear that complaint would lead to an instant retaliatory eviction be intolerable the sector should have be transform long time ago the bill as introduce be good starting point for the reform that be necessary but ministers could and should have strengthen this legislation rather than progressively water it down in forlorn attempt to appease minority of malcontent on the government benches as result of the government unwillingness to face down that minority the bill that we send to the other place today be not only far weak than it need be but in danger of be fatally compromise we will not oppose the passage of the bill tonight because it be essential that it progress but we hope that the noble lords address that danger and that over the come month we can convince the government to think again and ensure that this long overdue piece of legislation truly deliver for renter it be great tribute to my hon friend the minister that he have get the bill into form that be far well than it be on second reading and that it be so much improve that there will not be division on third reading that do not mean that everybody on the conservative benches be satisfied with all of the content of the bill although it be significantly improve recall the enthusiasm with which those on the conservative benches greet the third reading of the housing act which be be substantially amend by tonight proceeding that act introduce fundamental supply side reform and be at the heart of the thatcher revolution which transform the private rent sector from one in which nobody want to engage the sector be shrink and young barrister like be make living by try to defend the interest of landlord who have haplessly find themselves on the wrong end of the legislation we have move long way since then and one of the essential element of the act be the shorthold which be privately arrange agreement between landlord and tenant for period the tenant would be able to have exclusive possession of property that be rent by the landlord during that period neither the landlord nor the tenant would be able to renege on the agreement the rent would remain the same and the landlord would not be able to say that they need to get repossession of the property for any reason at all it seem to that the shorthold principle be still miss from the bill there be an amendment that would have bring back something like shorthold provision to provide privity of contract between landlord and tenant who wish to enter into an agreement on property in the same way that one can agree to rent somebody car or caravan the principle of privity of contract which be fundamental to conservative belief be enshrine in an amendment that be deem to be wreck amendment hope that that amendment which be sign by more than colleague will be resurrect in the other place where the rule be different that the principle enunciate in it will be take forward and that the bill will be far improve in the other place we need to ensure that we support conservative legislation that be design to increase the size of the rented sector rather than shrink it fear that the inevitable consequence of this we have already see bit of this in scotland will be that because the bill will reduce the supply of private rent accommodation the cost of that accommodation will go up fast than the rate of inflation the sort of people who have be campaign in the alliance to which the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook be refer will then say stop there we must have rent control and price control over rent because one set of regulation create another set of regulation then we will be back to where we be in that consequence be likely to flow from what we be approve tonight and just hope that it will be amend in their lordship house so that the supply side reform which be so fundamental to the legislation can be carry forward and we can give fresh confidence to people who be think about enter the private rent market and fresh confidence to those already in it so that they do not withdraw from it as they be do at the moment in increase number it do not help constituent who be try to get rent accommodation if that accommodation continue to escalate in price hope that if there be to be response to this short debate we will be able to have guarantee that under no conservative government will we ever have any system of rent control hope that the government will be able to assure we that as consequence of this legislation we will be able to increase the size of the private rent sector rather than diminish it far want to conclude by congratulate my hon friend the member for totnes anthony mangnall on have wag his campaign although it be not one man campaign because large cohort of people behind the scene support of his amendment as result of those amendment the bill have be improve significantly one of his amendment be not select and that be still in my view unfinished business but we should not shirk from congratulate he on have carry this campaign forward so effectively and successfully when the bill come back from the other place maybe in another year and half since it be first present we might be on the other side of general election some of we might think it would be well if we do not have the bill on the statute book by the time of the general election but that be another story will not go into that now whenever the bill come back hope that it will be in an improved form and that even more of my hon friend amendment which be well support on the government benches will be include in the text of the legislation with the leave of the house would just like to confirm to my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope that we do not intend to introduce any sort of rent control question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass prevention and suppression of terrorism we now come to motion the order paper note that the draft order have not yet be consider by the joint committee on statutory instruments have now be inform that the committee have consider these instrument and have not draw they to the attention of the house beg to move that the draft terrorism act proscribed organisations amendment no order which be lay before this house on april be approve be grateful to the house for its consideration of this draft order which will see the terrorgram collective proscribe the government assess that the terrorgram collective operate as an organisation in accordance with the guidance on the meaning of that term find in section of the terrorism act the terrorgram collective be the sixth extreme right wing group to be proscribe along with group proscribe for extreme islamist or other ideology this be base on the level of direction provide by its leadership for the preparation of propaganda campaign and the co ordination between the network to advance its neo fascist accelerationist ideology article of this order add the terrorgram collective to the list in schedule to the act as new entry have carefully consider all the evidence the government have conclude that the terrorgram collective should be proscribe while be unable to comment on specific intelligence can provide the house with summary of the group activity the terrorgram collective be transnational online network of neo fascist terrorist who produce and disseminate violent propaganda with the aim of radicalise reader and encourage individual to commit act of terrorism the message of hatred it preach be one of extreme white supremacism it call not just for death and violence but for the collapse of western democracy itself so that the collective might build white only world in its place the terrorgram collective have publish three long form magazine style publication as well as minute documentary video this propaganda be design to incite violence towards perceive representative of the establishment ethnic minority and other minority or religious community it not only celebrate the abhorrent cycle of violence and death that it mean to inspire it worship it glorify the collective genocidal peer as so call saint and encourage reader to commit similar act the terrorgram collective specifically celebrate anders breivik who kill eight people with car bomb before shoot dead people at youth camp in norway in as so call saint the government have determine that the terrorgram collective be an organisation concern in terrorism for example in february key contributor to the terrorgram collective be arrest for allegedly plot attack against the baltimore power grid the terrorgram collective be involve in prepare for terrorism through the dissemination of instructional material in its propaganda it promote and encourage terrorism through its publication which contain violent narrative and material that glorify previous extreme right wing attacker and encourage those who consume the content to commit similar action in october an extreme right wing terrorist attack gay bar in slovakia result in the murder of two people in his attack manifesto the perpetrator credit terrorgram publication since the attack terrorgram now glorify he as an example to follow the decision to proscribe terrorgram demonstrate this government commitment to defend the security of the lgbt community terrorgram hold vile antisemitic view it have publish propaganda material aim at incite violence against jewish community and the state of israel and most recently celebrate hamas attack on israel include endorse the use of terrorism to target israel and jewish community reporting indicate that terrorgram have advocate for attack on israel critical national infrastructure this proscription far demonstrate our unwavering commitment to fight antisemitism and our unfaltere support for the jewish community the safety and security of the public be paramount it be and always will be this government no priority the ongoing fight to counter and contain terrorism in all its guise be an essential part of that mission as be stand up for the value we cherish when our collective security and value be threaten by group such as the terrorgram collective we will not hesitate to act therefore urge member to support this proscription commend the draft order to the house thank the minister for his statement and thank civil servant at the home office for brief in advance of the debate today proscription order for the terrorgram collective also know as just terrorgram be bring about by the exceptional man and woman who serve in our intelligence and security service in government and in our police they perform vital public service and thank they for it we on the opposition benches will always work with the government on these crucial matter of national security in order to stop the malign force that seek to harm we divide we or undermine our way of life let say at the outset that the opposition support the proscription of terrorgram as terrorist organisation terrorgram take the form of an online network of neo fascist terrorist who produce and share violent material that incite violent extreme right wing activity here in the uk and abroad even after our nation existential fight and victory over fascist almost year ago their threat to our security and our way of life have never completely go away we must always defeat fascism wherever we find it that be why it be important that the order before we will amend schedule to the terrorism act to add terrorgram to the list of proscribe organisation do so will make it criminal offence to engage with the terrorgram group to promote support for it or to display its logo terrorgram name derive from it be group on the encrypt message platform telegram so we very much welcome the innovative approach to proscription outline by the minister even though terrorgram be without physical presence in the uk its online presence which glorify terrorist act and share bomb make material be threat to our national security the minister cite number of example will refer to the attack in slovakia in where the threat pose by terrorgram become deadly and tragic reality when year old assailant kill two people in an lgbt nightclub he later take his own life but leave manifesto that thank terrorgram for build the future of the white revolution one publication at time we approve of the government innovative action that will lead to the rightful proscription of terrorgram within legal framework there must be an approach that be relentless agile and cunning to defeat all terrorist group regardless of whatever warped ideology they peddle violent extremist across the spectrum continue to use online platform to radicalise their support base and organise their activity we must prepare to proscribe more online group if that be necessary these online group online cesspit regularly feature violent misogyny an abhorrent trait that be common feature in all terrorist ideology include extreme right wing terrorism as the minister will know very well the prevent programme currently do not recognise violent misogyny and incel ideology as extremist ideology will the minister provide an assurance that the appropriate framework be in place to bridge the gap between violent misogyny and recognise extremist ideology today proscription of terrorgram come after the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities publish the government definition of extremism in march although long overdue we believe this definition of extremism be welcome and will lead we towards well counter some of the cause of terrorist threat to our country as the minister would acknowledge the new definition be always intend to be the beginning of process to well counter extremism not the process in its entirety what progress have be make between the home office and the department for levelling up housing and communities on publish list of organisation designate as extremist terrorgram corrosive influence must also be view in the wide context of rise hate crime across the uk since police force in england and wales have record increase in report in four out of the five hate crime strand race sexual orientation disability and transgender furthermore since october the community security trust have record increase in antisemitic incident compare with and tell mama have record increase in anti muslim hate case in the past four month alone the minister will know that the last hate crime action plan be publish eight year ago he know more than other that proscription be an incredibly important mean to counter extremist activity but it be not the only mean new hate crime action plan could be part of the arsenal to disrupt and defeat violent extremism can the minister say what plan the home office have to publish an update one to conclude proscribe terrorgram be the right thing to do for our national security it be no long tolerable or safe for the poison of terrorgram violent ideology and terrorist material to be in reach of malign actor in our country it have to be treat with the strong and most robust antidote proscription we welcome that the uk be the first country to do so no government can ever relent in their determination to ensure that as country we be always one step ahead of those who seek to harm we to divide we or to undermine our way of life this house must always stand united in protect the public whom we strive to serve and protect that be why we strongly support this proscription order the snp firmly support this order as well and believe that no organisation should be free to spread extremist hate and encourage violence in the uk so it be absolutely right that the terrorgram collective be proscribe as terrorist organisation hear the minister mention that terrorgram be the sixth extreme right group to be proscribe and as understand it it be the first online network to be proscribe in this way and welcome that he have take that step tech against terrorism which also welcome this proscription have be track and report on terrorgram content for some time and have state that it send alert on this content to seven different platform only four of which have remove it understand from the explanatory note that this order now give the government the power to compel platform to take down such content have the minister have any communication with tech against terrorism or have he instruct these platform to take down this content because it have no place on they especially give this proscription order from today understand that the huffington post have name woman in the us dallas humber as terrorgram propagandist and narrator of some of its content as this be to some extent an issue of human right abuse be it possible that we can look at proscribe an individual under our exist magnitsky legislation could the government put restriction on this woman who have be name as perpetuate hate online or any other individual who be involve in set up this site these people should not be allow to travel around the world if this woman be to travel to the uk for example she could speak to people in the real world as oppose to just online will the minister take that away and consider whether something of that kind be indeed possible can the minister give we an up to date assessment of far right group as the government and the various intelligence agency be pick up on this and give it such high priority especially give the scene that we see on the street of london early this week extremism do not begin with organisation such as terrorgram or with the atrocity that people inspire by terrorgram have commit it start at much low level and people via the algorithm that these site use get expose to more and more extremist content have any work go into trace how some of these people get to very extreme content and what step could have be take to remove content at less extreme level before they get expose to something that radicalise they to the point of carry out atrocity there be prevention work to be do here have see various case where somebody come in with concern about lockdown and be now serious anti vaxxer because they see more and more extreme content and then get expose to more far right content and more dangerous content as result there be job of work to be do to deradicalise people who have be expose to such material what be the government do and what thought do they have on how they might go about deradicalise those who have be expose to far right content it be very serious threat to our democracy and the safety of people particularly minority in the uk do not think that it be quite be take seriously enough on behalf of the democratic unionist party add my support to the minister for his proscription of terrorgram he clearly outline the issue that be pertinent to the announcement express concern over the radicalism that seem to persist throughout society it seem to happen in way that perhaps from non technical point of view can not really understand but understand that the name of the organisation terrorgram tell we all about this group its very intention be evil and wicked its intention be to kill and to maim the minister announcement today encourage we as he often do when it come to these matter the minister announcement that the uk be the first country in the world to proscribe the terrorgram collective be positive and proactive by he and the government this group spread vile propaganda with evil indeed murderous intent and there be absolutely no place for it in modern society the minister rightly remind the house and myself in particular that the group be anti israel and anti jewish terrorgram hatred of israel and the jewish people be to be condemn unreservedly commend the minister on the government response and their support of israel within the law which they have give the whole way through on this issue the response be critical be friend of israel when be in the northern ireland assembly some year ago be there for year and have be friend of israel here be therefore encourage by the minister comment in relation to the support that he have give the israeli people and the jewish people in the face of downright hatred the terrorgram collective must be proscribe and it must be make criminally impossible for they to operate in any fashion so today announcement be good news do the minister agree that social medium play massive role in the distribution of horrific comment and opinion while it may not entirely be the issue today do he agree that much more need to be do legislatively for platform such as telegram and indeed other that be use by people to spew hatred whether that be tiktok twitter or any other unashamedly say that do not have the ability to do technical thing but be pleased that other do technical change can happen at breakneck speed do the minister intend to ensure that when anything come on the radar of our government parliament will respond immediately to proscribe it perhaps he can give we some idea of the timescale when something come to the attention of the house the security force or other will he respond in an urgent manner again thank the minister and our government for the proactive way that they respond it encourage as citizen and on behalf of the people of strangford the people of northern ireland and indeed all the people of this great nation that we love welcome all the comment make particularly by my hon friend the member for barnsley central dan jarvis he have be friend for many year and we have work together on many different operation in many different part of the world although very few be quite as vile as this one be afraid terrorgram be genuinely horrific organisation he raise some interesting point about the protection of the jewish community and he be absolutely right the community safety trust which he and both support will receive an additional million in funding to continue to provide measure until as he know that commitment be make only few week ago by the prime minister my hon friend also quite rightly raise the incident of anti muslim hatred that tell mama have record he be completely correct that we have sadly see an increase in that area as well as in antisemitism and he will know that we have also be very clear that those organisation mosque and school that require extra support and protection can get it from the home office indeed many have be apply and have have the privilege of ensure that they be able to get the funding they need for their own security to prevent harm to anybody in the muslim community as well want to touch briefly on some of the area raise by the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss who make some interesting point about an individual if she will forgive will not speak about that individual in particular but will say that proscription work against organisation and be not an individual power however she be also aware that sanction do work against individual and where we be aware that individual be connect to such hateful organisation certainly if they be connect to proscribe organisation as be confident terrorgram will be very shortly after this debate there be no way that somebody like that would be in the legal term conducive to the public good and there be no way that they should be allow access to the united kingdom the hon lady also raise an interesting point about st george day must say that have be to many st george day lunch at the very generous invitation of individual who when be still in uniform use to be very kind can see my hon friend the member for barnsley central remember they too we use to get invite to lunch in various part of the country my late be in west malling and may say that while we sit down for lunch at midday do not remember when we stand up from lunch that be great day of celebration and fantastic moment for all of we what we see yesterday be no celebration of st george day or english national patriotism it be simply thuggish violence and it have no place on our street on tech the hon lady be absolutely right that sadly it be very easy to go down rabbit hole or tech black hole that lead to an amazing warren of hate fill conspiracy theory this be an area where tech company themselves have responsibility to play their part have engage with they in many different area include child sexual abuse online which she know have devote lot of time to combat however this be another area where she be quite right that there be more work to be do and more responsibility on those who be profit from the attention of individual across the world the last point want to make be on the definition of extremism my hon friend the member for barnsley central know very well that this be an important piece of work there be more work to be do on the actual list as he rightly say but will bring it forward as soon as we ready to do so he will understand that we want to make sure it be as robust and complete as it possibly can be but he will be among the first to know as soon as it be ready have see some truly harrowing material in this job but the scene from the attack on the gay bar in slovakia where innocent people be gun down in cold blood rank among the absolute bad the manifesto write by the perpetrator advocate the murder of gay people jewish people and black people not for anything they have do but for who they be make no mistake this be not just an attack on the lgbt community and the terrorgram collective be not just threat to our national security this be an attack on the value and principle that define who we be and who we be as nation the terrorgram collective be threat to our society there be no place whatsoever for the vile ideology espouse by the terrorgram collective we will not tolerate it proscribe it be proportionate and necessary step in our ongoing effort to tackle terrorism protect the public and defend our value we will never relent in show terrorism for what it be poisonous corrosive force order before the minister sit down have to put the question on the defer division motion motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that at this day sitting standing order no defer division shall not apply to the motion in the name of secretary james cleverly relate to prevention and suppression of bell question agree to debate resume main question again propose minister you can finish now and with that mr deputy speaker commend the order to the

and banking hub in devon welcome the minister and colleague to the debate take quick stroll down your near high street mr deputy speaker and you will notice that there be few bank branch than there be in year go by far few in there be bank and build society branch in the uk in the number of bank and building society branch have fall from to that decline have not happen more quickly on any particular government watch the fall have be consistent and steady over the past year however we have reach tipping point bank branch be get scarce we notice when bank branch be go altogether from our high street people can not deposit cash or pay in cheque business and charity can not pop to the branch to refill their till or bank their taking at the end of the day and we no long have friendly face to talk to for financial advice when bank branch be go people have to travel mile to apply for loan or to arrange third party access to start bereavement proceeding for example people tell that when those branch be go manage their money become more difficult if not impossible people in my constituency travel to city and town such as exeter or honiton for their near branch every time bank decide to shut its high street branch my postbag fill up share those people frustration get it commend the hon member for secure the debate on this massive issue do he agree that bank abdication of their responsibility to rural community which often have the bad transport infrastructure and broadband connection can not be pave over with user guide to online banking at the very least hub that be accessible throughout the day and in the evening must be the minimum standard of service that any national bank must be require to provide for its customer the hon gentleman be absolutely right personally would benefit from how to bank online guide because it can be quite confusing even for someone who be relatively technical thank he for his point it be not enough to say that bank branch closure be commercial decision yes the government can not intervene and nor can as an mp stop bank branch from close as much as try but we have reach tipping point where enough be enough bank must provide core service to loyal customer on our high street and stop wash their hand of their customer need the bank claim that their branch on our high street be increasingly outdated they say that more customer be move online and go cashless that be broadly true but it be not an excuse simply to pull up stick and disappear in fact believe that bank branch closure across the uk be force people to change their habit but people still need access to cash and face to face banking service the demand be definitely still there to give couple of statistic of and of rely on face to face banking some among the old generation be not technophobe in fact they may have valid reason for not want to do online banking accord to research by age uk fear of be defraud and lack of it skill be common reason why many people prefer face to face banking if the need for face to face banking be still there what be the solution that bring to the second part of my speech my constituency have banking hub in belper which have become lifeline for business on the high street particularly small business because they can access cash and pay cash in encourage my hon friend to keep campaign for banking hub because they help every section of society old people young people and business that banking hub have rejuvenate the high street in belper thank my hon friend for her intervention it be almost as if she know what be about to say because be about to move on to the topic of banking hub which be relatively new concept think of they as share banking space they look bit like traditional bank branch but unlike traditional branch those hub be available to everyone they offer counter service customer from any bank can withdraw and deposit cash collect change deposit cheque pay bill and make balance inquiry they also offer private space for specific bank where customer can speak to someone from their own bank or building society about more complex issue such as mortgage loan and pension that be not really something that people want to do online banking hub be an industry lead solution to the demise of physical branch but the government have be clear that the delivery of hub must speed up they have do important work to legislate to protect access to cash not least through the financial services and markets act look forward to hear the minister remark in this debate and hope to hear about the progress be make in roll out more banking hub across the country know that he have have discussion with uk high street bank and have also hold roundtable with industry and mps about banking hub as east devon mp have be hold meeting locally to see how we can set up banking hub in the constituency last year launch local campaign lloyds in sidmouth the last bank in town be go to shut its door that be where live and local resident and want to send clear message to the bank that they should staff banking hub in sidmouth hundred of people get in touch through my survey and the result be quite startling of resident who respond say they have visit bank branch in the past six month and say they want staff from their own bank in the hub on the question in my survey what be the most common way that you access banking service say in branch or in person while say online and only say telephone my survey show clear demand for face to face banking and the need for banking hub in sidmouth here be what some local resident tell when lloyds announce it be close its branch in sidmouth mary say we wonder why it be sidmouth with all the holiday crowd folk festival regatta and jazz festival that the last bank be set to close there seem to be no logic do these decision maker have rusty old pin they use to decide which bank stay and which go susan tell be very upset to discover lloyds bank be close wonder what customer be suppose to do when they need paperwork either for power of attorney or closure of account after death pauline tell very nearly get scamme be not technology minded and do not bank online receive very convincing text message which result in my go to my bank to make payment if it be for the lady speak to in the bank would have have my account wipe clean she be very much on the ball so be save this show the importance of have bank in sidmouth local resident such as mary susan and pauline be delighted when sidmouth banking hub open its door last month it have be very popular but be it perfect no although would like to pay tribute to the staff who be fantastic because it be not yet quite what the town need because it need cashpoint it need to have atm available outside with printer so that resident can get mini statement as well as trial of saturday opening hour if at all possible however want to thank the team at cash access uk and the building contractor for get the hub up and run so successfully before lloyds close its door be also pleased to visit axminster banking hub when it open hear feedback from local resident and business about how important it be for that town more banking hub such as the one in sidmouth and axminster be need in devon and want to put that firmly on the record in today debate be currently work with local community to try to get banking hub in town such as exmouth budleigh salterton and ottery st mary exmouth the large town in devon will need banking hub soon rather than later and have already make the case for one halifax branch in the town will close this summer which will leave just three bank remain in exmouth the case for banking hub in budleigh salterton be also strong it have be without high street bank due to closure in recent year the last bank in town lloyds close in january the town population be significantly old than the national average local resident and business have only the post office and the co op to access over the counter banking service have see the queue and it be not great although it be small shop and the staff work incredibly hard that be why have make formal request for banking hub alongside local councillor henry riddell know the government want the delivery of banking hub to be speed up and hope that exmouth budleigh salterton and ottery st mary will be in line for banking hub too would cite these example as to where problem lie believe the criterion for whether an area should get banking hub must be relax because the bar be far too high at the moment generally in order to get banking hub town need people within km of the centre and at least retailer it also need there to be no bank at all in other word the last bank in town must be close or already have close too often it take the last bank in town to shut before the industry get its act together and open banking hub on this point exmouth will not get banking hub under the current criterion until nationwide tell when visit last week that it will keep its rolle street branch open until at least of course welcome that commitment by nationwide which be play fair by the high street but that commitment in effect mean that banking hub will not open in exmouth while the branch remain which make no sense to we have to consider the size of exmouth and we also have to consider the number of bank the town use to have we do need to look again at the criterion and to lower the bar recently co sign letter from my hon friend the member for hertford and stortford julie marson to the financial conduct authority to unlock more banking hub the fca will decide on new rule in the third quarter of this year and will be watch that like hawk this could be an important turning point so that even more banking hub can open as have say more banking hub such as those in sidmouth and axminster be badly need in my part of devon people should be able to access banking service on our high street be delighted to have secure today debate and look forward to hear the minister remark it be an absolute pleasure to respond to this debate and thank my hon friend the member for east devon simon jupp for secure it we know that our colleague in this place all work hard for their constituent but some go the extra mile would say that on this subject like so many other my hon friend be an exemplar of what can be see in british politic and in this parliament his work on secure access to banking service in his constituency be second to none appreciate the strength of feeling across the chamber on this topic share the concern of many member in light of the more than closure announcement we have see in the past year bank and building society be essential in people be able to manage their money on day to day basis and they hold privileged and important place in our society as such firm must ensure that all customer wherever they live have appropriate access to banking and cash service we need to be grow up about this issue we all recognise as my hon friend make clear in his remark that the world of banking have change greatly in recent year reflect that shift customer have increasingly move towards online and mobile access that shift be apparent across many area of the economy and society not just in banking recent financial conduct authority datum show that only of british adult still regularly use bank branch in contrast almost nine in adult bank online or use mobile app it be right that firm continue to innovate in response to change customer habit and ensure that customer across the uk benefit from the late development in technology but those change in technology this be fundamental point and believe my hon friend will share my view do not mean that access to in person banking and cash service be no long require they remain vitally important to many people up and down the country in our constituency in time of need or when more personalised support and service be require such as in the example that my hon friend mention speak to real person face to face can be essential more broadly the wide societal benefit to our constituency our high street and our market town of bank branch be critically important in the light of those thing the government have take decisive action over recent year to ensure that access to cash be protect through the financial services and markets act it place responsibility on the fca to seek to ensure reasonable provision of cash withdrawal and deposit facility include free service for personal current account follow the passage of that act the government publish policy statement set out our policy on access to cash the fca must have regard to that policy statement as part of its regulatory approach the statement set out that people and business should be no further than mile from free cash access point as my hon friend mention the fca have recently hold consultation on its propose regulatory regime in this area under the proposal bank and building society that be designate by the government will be require to assess and fill gap or potential gap in cash access provision that significantly impact consumer and business as well as access to cash the fca have guidance on bank branch closure while decision on individual closure be rightly commercial issue for firm we do not want government ministers decide where bank branch go tempt and fascinate as would be by that process we expect firm to adhere to the fca guidance that guidance be clear that bank and building society must ensure that they carefully consider the impact of plan closure on their customer where firm fall short of those expectation the fca have the power to ask for closure to be pause or for other option to be put in place and it will do so it be important to make the point that the industry have make great stride to provide range of initiative through alternative such as agreement with the post office or community outreach programme in location such as community centre library and village hall shared banking hub be as we have hear another exciting and popular innovation banking hub be clear example of pioneer industry lead innovation to protect access in change landscape as my hon friend the member for mid derbyshire mrs latham make clear banking hub can be lifeline to community be pleased that the sidmouth hub have be open where my hon friend the member for east devon have the privilege of cut the ribbon or whatever they have he cut but it be important that the house and indeed everybody know that banking hub can be modern century way to ensure access to cash and banking service the government strongly support this innovation these hub help people and business withdraw and deposit cash pay in cheque and check their balance over the post office counter and also provide community banker who can help people with wide banking service from make transfer to provide support for fraud and scam victim my hon friend mention victim in his constituency who he have be work with hubs be deploy by cash access uk in response to link assessment of the community cash need to ensure there be no gap in the provision of service the industry have commit that if hub be recommend the branch it replace will not be close for up to month until that hub be open and if there be delay beyond that temporary hub will be put in place to date over hub have be announce across the country and be open this be welcome programme and it be priority to that the industry continue to deliver on this but speed it up uk finance the trade body represent the industry have recently commit to total of hub to be open in the next month like my hon friend and many in the house will be watch and hold it to account and make sure that those hub open as quickly as possible as the minister know represent derbyshire dales where we recently have the closure of the last bank the national westminster bank in bakewell that be the last bank in the peak district my concern be that the criterion for hub exclude we because bakewell be too small it have only to people and under the present criterion there have to be what might work in belper or another part of district or county like derbyshire or indeed devon might not work elsewhere mean that people will be leave behind will the government look with the fca at whether the criterion should be change to take into account area that surround small town where that small town might still be vibrant but not big enough on its own to qualify for hub what be the future in this area thank my hon friend for her point and should not have leave she out when talk about the committed members of parliament who work on this area pay tribute to she for the number of time she have question badger and advocate for her community and constituent on this subject and today be another good example if she wait few minute will address her specific point directly it be important that hub provide good service to customer and the industry evolve its offer as it learn from the roll out of the hub that be already open follow recent discussion have hold with the uk high street bank and my roundtable with industry representative and mp last month be pleased that the industry have agree to improve the service in hub to ensure they be genuine alternative to bank branch my hon friend the member for east devon refer to some improvement he would like to see in his constituency participate high street bank have commit to range of improvement to the banking service provide in hub such as first have an agree consistent and improved level of service provide by all firm secondly ensure that personal customer do not need to bring their own device to access service and thirdly trialle various new service such as customer liaison service and saturday opening those improvement will make big difference to participation and indeed to how welcome banking hub be be grateful for the constructive and positive approach that have see from industry in its engagement with his majesty treasury recognise the need of its customer have write to all mp and to the chair of the treasury committee on the package turn to the point make by my hon friend the member for derbyshire dales miss dines firm have provide with reassurance that they will continue to revisit the criterion for location to be eligible for hub to ensure that they reflect customer need and that they will do so in particular follow the publication of the fca response to its recent access to cash consultation that be important because rural area and small place such as bakewell sometimes lose out know that the industry will be watch the debate and will take what be say seriously let we revisit the criterion in sensible way to ensure that they take account of area that need banking hub service but be not currently accommodate that be very important and will work with the industry to see what it can do to deliver on what have just say from the dispatch box believe that the measure set out in the package mark significant step forward from industry in ensure that customer need be be meet but reassure the house that will continue to monitor the roll out of banking hub closely be grateful that we have have another chance to discuss this important topic while branch closure be commercial decision and it be right that they be strongly believe that all customer wherever they live and whatever their age should have access that be appropriate for they to banking and cash service be grateful for the engagement have have from the sector and the fca on this important issue thank again my hon friend the member for east devon for bring the debate to the chamber and thank my hon
