be grateful for be able to contribute to this debate it be privilege to follow so many powerful speech and the speech deliver by my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen be the most powerful have hear in this place her word rise to the moment mine be inadequate by comparison can only thank she for speak so powerfully about an issue that affect so many of we welcome the new secretary of state to his place and thank he for the way in which he open this debate at the outset draw the house attention to my background as an officer of the gmb union and my current unpaid role as chair of the gmb parliamentary group in that capacity thank the hon member for dundee central chris law as he leave the chamber for what he say about members staff in this place gmb be the union that represent the majority of people who work in support of we as member of this house be sad to say that they be perhaps uniquely vulnerable to some of the abusive practice that have sham our democracy for too long and be at loss to understand how the relevant lords amendment be ever bring forward from the other place wish to speak specifically against lords amendment and and in support of the government amendment that seek to strike they out before do so want to say few word about my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders who be not in his place at the moment as former shadow minister and latterly as the sponsoring minister for this bill he unfailingly and characteristically bring graft industry and good humour to the brief this will be weak and less bill without he and those of we who support the bill and its principle owe he debt of thank be glad that my hon friend the member for halifax kate dearden who bring real depth of knowledge and understanding to the role of under secretary of state for business and trade be now guard the bill passage to royal assent know that she will be both pro worker and pro business in her approach believe that lords amendment contain significant drafting weakness and would fundamentally alter the nature of the propose and restore school support staff negotiate body first the amendment state that employer may introduce new term and condition of employment that meet or exceed any minimum standard set by the sssnb in legal term however the sssnb will not set or determine those standard it be statutory forum for negotiation the actual condition of employment will be set through regulation draft by the secretary of state and approve by parliament secondly the actual parameter of future pay and grade structure will be negotiate by the relevant party the representative of employer and the representative of employee that be the spirit of the original act and the actual operation of the sssnb in its original incarnation give my experience as former trade union officer represent school support staff know the contractual issue that need to be address be so complicated that they can not be satisfactorily resolve on the floor of the house that complexity be result of year of drift dither and political disinter in the support staff worker in england who keep our school go and it be damn indictment of the decision to cancel the original sssnb finally lords amendment risk create confusion at local level the amendment state that employer must not be restrict from introduce improved term and condition but change to contract be not merely introduce they be consult on and agree either individually or collectively under exist statute the effect of the somewhat loose wording in the amendment may be to encourage local attempt to make unilateral variation to contract and term and condition member who support this amendment might say that only improvement could be make under it but both improvement and detriment be subjective term they be in the eye of the beholder and believe that if the amendment be to be carry through the actual effect may be to increase the number of court case concern school support staff urge the opposition not to push point and to reconsider their wide opposition to the school support staff negotiate body school support staff undertake essential role and they deserve the same professional standard and professional respect that be afford to teacher that be what the restoration of the school support staff negotiate body will achieve we have debate the official opposition amendment many time at various stage but want to comment on some of the lords amendment that stand in the name of liberal democrat peer either in whole or in part when enter this chamber at the start of the debate do not presume that those amendment necessarily enjoy the support of the liberal democrat front benchers in the commons but be afraid that impression be dispel by the contribution from the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for richmond park sarah olney be at loss to understand how the radical change in approach have come about among the liberal democrats in this house between committee stage report third reading and the debate that we be hold today in fact listen to the hon lady feel an uncomfortable sense of déjà vu it be like watch the rose garden press conference all over again after all her front bench colleague the hon member for chippenham sarah gibson and for torbay steve at all time appropriately critical in committee but they be essentially supportive of the principle of enhance worker right lord amendment which be originally conservative amendment in the commons but now stand in the name of liberal democrat peer be not support by the liberal democrats in committee lord amendment which stand in the name of both liberal democrat and conservative peer seek to amend clause however the liberal democrats support that clause in committee and only voice concern which be reasonable that timely guidance to employer must be issue to accompany it indeed they vote with labour members when it be put to vote in committee fear that this amendment too could have serious unintended consequence the clause that it seek to amend put duty on employer to offer regular hour contract to be the language use in the legislation as it stand at the moment but the amendment seek to convert that duty into right to request by employee employee be of course more restrictive category than worker indeed clause of the bill as draft make it clear that for the purpose of the interpretation of this bill worker and employee mean two different thing many of the people who be class only as worker be precisely those who may benefit the most from these protection some million people who be nominally casual worker in sector such as social care construction hospitality security and retail could be exclude from these protection if the amendment which stand in the name of conservative and liberal democrat peer be to be carry hope it be not the intention of those on the conservative benches to exclude those million people at the start of this debate could not believe that that be the intention of the liberal democrats but now be not so sure
