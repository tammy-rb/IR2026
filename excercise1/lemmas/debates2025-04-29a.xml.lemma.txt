as another member of this house who vote in to recognise the state of palestine in motion that this house pass will say that progress on this matter be long overdue hope the minister have hear loud and clear the message from many of we that continue to delay that be problematic the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne might be surprised that agree with he there be concern about what will be leave of the state of palestine despite the existence of theogenic technology israeli force be now burn to the ground the agricultural field in northern gaza in apparent pursuit of the tunnel that hamas be use for their terrorist attack we know that nearly child in gaza have be diagnose as suffer from acute malnutrition we all desperately want to see aid resume to palestine because we know that there be no future for any state if people be starve to death will the minister update we on the practical detail he discuss last night with the palestinian authority about how we will get food back into gaza and get movement in this process just for the record in case hansard do not pick that up that be jenny the dog cross the floor not member of parliament be sure the hon member for torbay steve darling be grateful to you for that clarification madam deputy speaker even if be not as jenny would always be most welcome on this side of the house hope that have reassure the hon gentleman that we do have the legislation require to act would be very happy to report to the house on the reason why we would not do that be sure the hon lady will allow to write to she separately to set out how intend for we to do that it seem to be reasonable request return to my original point the current drafting would mean that dwp can compel information of that kind from private landlord or estate agent but not from housing association there be an inequity there that we be seek to address with the amendment clarify the drafting and continue to protect the personal information of service user of crisis support or advocacy service the bill also bring forward new information gather power that govern how dwp authorise officer can compel information to support an investigation into fraud it also set out where information must not be compel for example to protect the long stand principle of legal professional privilege separately the bill bring forward power of entry search and seizure for dwp authorise investigator those task with investigate the most serious case of fraud it do that by bring those authorise investigator under the remit of the police and criminal evidence act in england and wales and by create similar power in scotland for dwp authorise investigator that ensure that those investigator be govern by similar legal framework to other law enforcement body that be grant access to use those type of power government amendment seek to ensure that the exemption to information that dwp authorise officer can compel be not applicable to authorised investigator when use power of entry search and seizure government amendment mirror that provision for the psfa those amendment will support effective fraud investigation as without access crucial evidence might remain out of reach slow down our response to fraud those exemption be important but the police and criminal evidence act which apply in england and wales already provide such restriction and safeguard by only enable that information to be compel with the approval of the court couple with similar convention that apply for scotland the amendment ensure that there be no duplication the power in the bill remain in line with exist convention as set out in pace and correctly reflect the norm of the scottish legal system turn to government amendment to paragraph of schedule currently refer to definition within pace in relation to special procedure material confidential professional material exclude material and item subject to legal privilege government amendment and set out specific definition to avoid link provision that relate solely to scotland with exist legislation that apply to england and wales this also ensure that legal privilege and item subject to legal privilege reference contain in the schedule be correctly define for scotland government amendment and be consequential to amendment government amendment and ensure that the power for the dwp under pace take by the bill in schedule be align with those of the police and other government departments such as hmrc and provide clear legal framework for what evidence can be seize and how it should be handle government amendment and mean that dwp authorise investigator such as the police can seize item that be reasonably believe to be evidence of an offence not just dwp relate offence when undertake entry search and seizure activity in england and wales this will mean that potential evidence of any other offence if discover in the course of search can be preserve and may be seize where it be consider necessary to prevent it from be destroy or move the amendment ensure that the law be clear on how it must be handle and transfer to the most appropriate law enforcement agency in england and wales government amendment and make similar provision for authorised investigator in scotland to those have just describe for england and wales government amendment and clarify how authorised investigator can prevent access to seize evidence from any offence if it may prejudice criminal proceeding in scotland by amend the definition of offence in schedule insert by schedule of this act this mirror the same provision that be already in the bill as it apply to england and wales government amendment and be all minor and technical amendment to correct inconsistency in terminology government amendment be minor and technical amendment to provide the correct reference to power in the social security administration act to ensure that the power in scotland align with those in england and wales government amendment amend the period of time in which warrant must be exercise to scotland from three month to one month this correct the bill to ensure that it be consistent with the usual practice in scotland government amendment ensure that the court have the power to order person have be disqualify to provide their ni or eu drive licence as be already the case for those hold gb licence under the new debt recovery power the bill as draft would allow dwp debtor who evade payment and hold an ni or eu licence to be disqualify from drive however it inadvertently limit the court ability to order that person to produce their licence unless it be issue in great britain undermine the power and cause administrative difficulty for the court and the driver and vehicle licensing agency government amendment correct this and ensure parity between gb ni and eu drive licence under the power in schedule government amendment and ensure that the application and limitation period in clause follow the policy intention that the psfa can investigate fraud and recover debt in england and wales government amendment also ensure that the dwp debt recovery power in this bill be not limited in scotland to the usual five year time limit in the prescription and limitation scotland act this make it clear that the long year recovery period in
