to questions culture media and sport the secretary of state be ask grassroots music support what assessment she have make of the potential merit of require venue to introduce surcharge on large event ticket to support grassroots music venue if she will take step to require arena stadium and major festival to charge ticket levy to help fund grassroots live music pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale for support my maternity leave the chance to raise tiny child be fleeting and precious and his superb stewardship of my portfolio grant that gift one of my big worry on stand for election and then become minister be that it might prove incompatible with start and now expand my family simply say to other woman who want to get involve in public life do not be afraid there be lot of talk of barrier but service and motherhood be compatible privilege as my right hon friend the member for norwich north chloe smith say so encouragingly to you can do it grassroot live music venue be the talent pipeline of our music industry we be support they with fund and rate relief we have no plan for government mandate ticket levy but we encourage industry discussion welcome the minister back to her place in edinburgh we benefit from plethora of small venue that depend on the edinburgh festival to survive we also have big event every year at the moment all the excitement even in my household be about taylor swift come to the city in june but we recognise that small venue the music venue trust say currently struggle to survive and depend on grant from it do not get any benefit from big gig will the government consider levy to support small venue because without they we will never have the elton johns the queens and the taylor swifts who use they to learn their craft develop and benefit our economy and culture the hon lady be absolutely right that grassroots venue be the talent incubator of the music industry she will be aware that the chancellor give substantial amount of money at last year budget up to million for new hub for the edinburgh fringe because of that talent pipeline for the edinburgh fringe and the edinburgh festival we be do what we can with various different pot of money but we also think there be room for the industry to find solution on ticket levy we think it be probably good for the industry to do that rather than mandate it as government welcome my hon friend back to her place in across the country not just in edinburgh live music boom with some million people attend gig yet small venue close more than one week draw the minister attention to an analogy with another hugely successful leisure industry football where small amount of the enormous rich gain by the premier league be allow to trickle down to the grassroot so that the future of the sport be preserve just as with football we have hugely profitable large arena where the superstar of today perform and create huge revenue levy on the ticket from those sort of be sorry mr speaker be very passionate about this would help small venue to produce the superstar of tomorrow so will the minister take positive attitude towards levy my right hon friend have make his point well if not briefly we agree about the importance of grassroots music which be why we have give another million to the support grassroots music fund but we be also in close touch with the music venue trust which have great initiative call own our venues arts council england be help with the purchase of some of the freehold of these venue we support that as well but we think there be more scope for the industry to lead solution and we be back talk between different part of the industry let we hear from the industry call pete wishart the music industry be just about the most unequal sector in the whole of society those at the bottom the vast majority earn an absolute pittance while those at the very top have unimaginable earning surely we should be do everything possible to try to change that it be the sensible option they do it in france and the scottish national party government be consider do it in scotland will the minister support that effort and initiative in scotland and if it show that it can help redistribute some of this money will she follow that example thank the hon gentleman for tell we what the scottish national party be do have understand that it be cut substantial amount from the art budget we have be support for instance the edinburgh grassroot hub think there be great deal of appetite in this place for solution also think that the good option be for those in the industry to get together and we be back discussion of that kind indeed before go on leave talk to mark davyd of the music venue trust about the issue too warmly welcome the minister back to her place she mention the million for the support grassroots music fund and that be greatly welcome but let we be clear festival rehearsal space and independent promoter be also eligible for the fund that be lot of mouth to feed they be all important part of the ecosystem and they all need fund in real term this be tiny amount of money for grassroots music venue be my hon friend push the treasury to expand that funding to ensure that it can go far thank the hon lady for draw on her expertise in this regard and for the work that the select committee be do be go to provide that dreadful answer ahead of the budget we will be discuss all these matter with the treasury creative industries tax relief whether her department have make an assessment of the potential impact of tax relief on the growth of the creative industry let begin by welcome the minister back to her place since the conservative government have introduce tax relief for the creative industry year on year that be one of the reason why the creative industry be grow at twice the rate of the rest of the economy and why they be world lead the labour party oppose every single one of those tax relief and despite its warm word it offer no substantive action as my right hon and learn friend say since we come to office we have introduce number of tax relief that have support child television video game production gallery orchestra theatre and museum it be for the chancellor to decide on tax policy but can my right hon and learn friend tell we what more she can do to make this go far to ensure that we remain one of the world lead production venue we have indeed introduce many tax relief and since we come to office have instigate and back the introduction of tax relief and other support for the sector independent film making have be support with more than million of government and national lottery funding and have recently speak to representative of the independent

of tax credit for performance in the european economic area be direct result of brexit and could make touring in europe unviable for orchestra what be the minister message to my constituent whose ability to tour in europe be be sacrifice on the altar of brexit fundamentalism unlike the snp we actually listen to what people say in referenda so be afraid we will not be rejoin the eu and therefore we can not have special tax privilege on that basis dcms be aware of the concern of tour orchestra we be facilitate discussion with his majesty revenue and customs so the orchestra know precisely where they stand on some of the issue they have raise film and television industry what step her department be take to support the growth of the film and television industry we have see significant growth in the film and tv industry the support that we have take include reform to audiovisual tax relief uplift for animation and child tv and million of investment in the uk global

of the american production machine know that my hon friend be himself veteran of the silver screen appear in the brilliant british house of cards our film industry be world lead he be right that the strike cause disruption we work very closely with our partner in other jurisdiction one example be the international hit film barbie which be film in the uk support job add million to our economy and earn more than billion at the global box office we need to ensure that the film industry could continue to thrive after the strike which be why we be continue to support the industry with tax incentive fund pot and importantly the development of skill pipeline to ensure success long into the future bbc current affairs coverage impartiality whether she have have recent discussion with the bbc board on the impartiality of the bbc current affair coverage the bbc have duty to deliver its impartial and accurate news and current affair coverage under its royal charter it be editorially independent which mean that editorial policy be matter for the bbc but both the secretary of state and regularly meet the bbc leadership team we have discuss the important issue of impartiality on multiple occasion it be also key focus of the government mid term review of the bbc governance and regulation as former bbc journalist myself completely believe in its editorial independence from the government but just as strongly consider it essential that the bbc across all its programming and from all presenter should be absolutely and unequivocally impartial give the concern that we have hear about the current coverage of israel and the occupied palestinian territories the reporting of the resignation of the president of harvard and example of where ofcom have find significant editorial failing do my hon friend agree that the bbc need to work consistently constantly and visibly to enforce that requirement on impartiality thank my hon friend for his question he be absolutely right trust be the bbc currency that be especially important in relation to its international coverage particularly during conflict so it must use its word with care with regard to the event in israel and gaza the government have be clear that the bbc should reflect on its coverage and learn lesson for the future but of course we again emphasise impartiality and the high editorial standard that be strategic priority of the bbc leadership and we be talk to they about this in relation to the mid term review and licensing renewal call the snp spokesperson as an ex bbc reporter be in awe of my former colleague bravery and impartiality when they cover world affair we have all follow with horror the israeli bombardment of gaza reporter without borders say that it appear that israel be now directly target journalist the al jazeera bureau chief have have three child kill include his journalist son what unimaginable pain another palestinian journalist ayat khaddoura say when will this war end who will tell the world what we go through and what we see bring her question to the house as she be no long alive to do so can the minister share with journalist across the world how the government refusal to call for ceasefire be advance the cause of journalistic freedom or peace in the region and can she tell we who the government position have persuade apart from those on the labour front bench who remain limpet close to the tory position on gaza as on so many other issue that question be long way from the impartiality of the bbc we must ensure that we stick to the subject of the question suggest to the hon gentleman that topical would have be much well place for his question minister can you pick out the part that you need to simply wish to pay tribute to every journalist who put their life on the line to bring truth to the public attention they play an incredibly important role we be proud of what the bbc journalist do in particular they have also do some awesome thing in ukraine as government we just want to say that we support their work and pay tribute to they access to sport woman and girl what progress she have make on increase woman and girl access to sport woman and girl should have exactly the same access to sport as boy and man that be why we support the recommendation in karen carney excellent report it be why we be invest million to boost equal access to sport and why we recently announce million for the lionesses futures fund to deliver pitch across the country with priority access for woman and girl with further opportunity for woman and girl we have have fantastic success with woman football particularly the lionesses include harrogate rachel daly who have be great inspiration locally but what step be my right hon and learn

sport at every level sport england this girl can campaign fund by the government inspire million of woman and girl to get involve in all sport the school games programme also fund by the government encourage child to take up sport and get active call the shadow secretary of state unfortunately in recent week there have be spate of disgusting sexist misogynistic abuse direct towards sportswomen just for be at the top of their game know that the under secretary of state for culture media and sport the right hon member for pudsey stuart andrew have be on the receiving end just for stand up to it which commend he for agree with he that vile misogynistic comment be dangerous the reality be that they be put woman and girl off sport do the secretary of state agree that every sporting organisation should have strategy to eliminate all form of sexual harassment and abuse agree with the hon member we should not have misogynistic bully behaviour in sport and all govern body should be look at what their sport be do we set out in our sport strategy how we should have fair competition and integrity in sport the secretary of state mention the carney review but be afraid that the government seem to be fail woman football on that with complete lack of detail about how the implementation group to put into practice the carney review recommendation will work without senior leadership that group will not have the tooth that it need and all the hard work will be put at risk fan player and club deserve urgent action and leadership from the top if the secretary of state do not reform the woman game and give it the same prominence as the man will will she commit to chair the implementation group and report back to parliament so that mps can hold she to account completely dispute what the hon member say about our support for woman in sport and woman in football have have the pleasure of meet karen carney on number of occasion her report be excellent we endorse all its recommendation many of which be for the fa which have also speak to on this subject will ensure that the recommendation be fulfil the implementation board will have all the govern body on it its first meeting be in march will keep very close eye on the board and will work very closely with my right hon friend the under secretary on that and every other issue topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility as draw to close official statistic highlight that under this government the creative industry continue to thrive they now employ almost million worker growth of so we be well on our way to meet our objective to grow the creative industry by billion and increase employment by million by local commercial radio whether in lancashire or suffolk can fill the gap leave by the reduction in bbc local radio coverage but in the lowestoft and waveney area it be constrain in do so as the local digital audio broadcasting network have not be extend to cover the area please can my right hon and learn friend arrange for that important infrastructure which be available throughout most of the uk to be extend to north east suffolk as soon as possible completely agree with my hon friend on the importance of local radio to listener across the uk and know that he be an effective campaigner for his local area the bbc and commercial radio be responsible for the operation of their respective radio network include the dab radio network but have ask my official to engage with local dab multiplex operator and broadcaster to look at whether there be desire to increase local dab coverage far do the secretary of state agree that in the medium world content be king and that that be why we must support our world lead creative talent will she take step to require artificial intelligence developer to provide songwriter and composer with detailed information as to how their work be be use include when authorisation have be grant for use of those work as training datum the right hon member be absolutely right about the importance of protect the original work of the creative industry have hold number of roundtable to ensure that we protect that originality the intellectual property office be work on that very issue and have be liaise with it and with the secretary of state for science innovation and technology the secretary of state will be aware that the premier league and the english football league have hold meeting and yet have fail to come up with solution for fairer redistribution of funding give their inability to come to an agreement will she get the two side together round the table she be probably already do it to encourage they to come up with solution fail that if legislation be necessary will she consider it because we do not want to see any club go under it be absolutely right that deal should be do the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew and have be encourage all the authority to come to an arrangement we have be clear that if no arrangement be reach there will obviously be backstop in the legislation for the football regulator that we will bring forward to the house shortly as the secretary of state will be aware charity be face an extremely challenging fundraising environment and at the same time be try to respond to increase demand due to the cost of living crisis will she explain why the government continue to impose sale restriction on charity lottery fundraising the removal of which would not cost the treasury single penny but would ensure much need additional fund for charitable cause that would hugely benefit community in my constituency and across the whole uk as probably one of the few member of this house who have actually set up charity lottery understand the importance of they it be right to say that we do significant review of they not so long ago know the hon member be probably refer to one particular lottery and have write to that lottery with suggestion have consult with the gambling commission of way it may be able to expand within the current remit but as department we be extremely busy at the moment deal with the gambling white paper that have to take priority once we have do that we will consider what further work may need to be do on society lottery with both wealdstone and uxbridge football club embed in my constituency grassroots football be incredibly important to the people of uxbridge and south ruislip club like those offer more than just football they act as vital community hub and support significant increase in girl football through to special educational provision and much more for the benefit of the club and fan across my constituency will the minister give the house an update on the progress be make to protect grassroots football include how television revenue will be distribute to ensure that those important community asset do not just survive but flourish my hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of football club like wealdstone and uxbridge they be incredibly important in provide opportunity for people to become physically active but be also integral part of our community that be why as my right hon friend the secretary of state just mention we have be urge the football authority to come up with deal so that that money can flow down and we can ensure that our great football sport that we have in this country continue to flourish this year in scotland we will have the chance to see the scottish football team on terrestrial television that be rare opportunity not just because we have qualify but because scottish football like other sport be become increasingly difficult to view because it be increasingly behind paywall that be damage its attraction to young people who want to see it will the minister tell we what discussion be take place to try to alleviate that problem be glad that people in scotland will be able to watch their national team believe that our current list work well it be important that we strike the right balance because we have to ensure that the sport right holder use the income they get to benefit the whole of that sporting environment that be something we look at constantly but think that at the moment we have the right balance give ofcom comment that it be consider whether its proposal for regulation of local radio be still appropriate in the light of the bbc change to local radio provision do the minister agree that the bbc mid term review be good opportunity to look at how the bbc deliver for old audience particularly in its local radio provision the mid term review be very important point where we can look far and indeed have look far at number of issue include competition complaint and impartiality we will be publish the result of the mid term review very shortly the minister will know that warwick and leamington leamington be also know as silicon spa enjoy the great concentration of game company in the world appreciate what be say in the autumn statement but there be skill shortage can the minister update we on what be be do to address that the gaming industry in this country be world lead and have have the pleasure of visit number of gaming company to see how they be thrive we have creative industry skill package which we commit to in the creative industry sector vision to ensure pipeline of talent all the way from primary school right up until someone second or third job and there be measure at every single one of those step wallington fc be an amazing local football club in roundshaw in carshalton and wallington but it be have trouble maintain its lease with the new owner and its very old sport pavilion need an overhaul can the minister set out what support be available from the department or other organisation to help with that the volunteer that my hon friend mention be absolutely the lifeblood of community sport and it be vital that they have those facility as mention early again we be invest more than million and any team can have discussion with the local authority and the football foundation be happy to meet he privately to discuss that and perhaps give he some pointer performer in the uk be have their image voice or likeness reproduce by other use ai technology without their consent the copyright designs and patents act which regulate performer intellectual property do not account for ai when will this government act to protect the right of artist performer and other creative in the uk or be they content to see this continue exploitation and violation of people intellectual property right the hon member will know that in the uk we have world lead protection for copyright and intellectual property we want to make sure that as we move into new technological age with generative ai we continue to protect creative work assure she that we be work closely with the industry and the intellectual property office to ensure that we get the good protection we can and know that an update on the ipo work will be publish shortly one of the key recommendation of the carney review into woman football be the need for an improvement in mental health provision in elite woman sport think the government have accept most of the recommendation of the carney review so can the secretary of state give we an update on how she think mental health provision need to be improve in woman elite sport my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight that important piece of work in karen carney review know that football authority such as the fa for example be start work in this area but that be precisely why we will be introduce the implementation group because we want to ensure that pressure be put on to do the work that be need and to do it quickly labour have programme for new generation of youth hub because we know that our young people be struggle with mental health challenge school themselves and other and some be be pick off by criminal gang in contrast with our programme the ymca have identify cut in funding since and loss of frontline youth worker when will the government invest in our young people and in comprehensive youth service be grateful for the hon lady question because this be something feel very passionately about be very proud that we be invest million in our national youth guarantee and that we already have in place programme to build youth club we have already build throughout the country spend million we want constructive thing for people to do which be why we be spend million on our sport pitch have strengthen the statutory guidance in relation to what local authority be require to do and we be work across department to ensure that our young people have something to do somewhere to go and someone to talk to church commissioners the hon member for south west bedfordshire represent the church commissioners be ask choral music cathedral whether the commissioners be take step to support choral music in cathedral the church commissioners provide million to support music in cathedral during the pandemic that sum be match fund by the cathedral music trust the commissioner be extremely grateful to the trust for do what it do to help ensure that worship in our cathedral remain of the high calibre my hon friend will know that cathedral school such as lichfield cathedral school play an important part in provide young chorister for cathedral but they be very concerned that if they have to charge on their fee and possibly lose their charitable status they may no long be viable and will go bust what assessment have the commissioner make of the effect of such change can tell my hon friend that there be concern that cathedral school may not be able to afford to pay business rate if the payment of business rate and the addition of vat on fee cause choir school to close that would be an issue for number of cathedral rough sleeping what step the church be take to support work by local authority and the government on reduce rough sleeping many parish church provide shelter and support for rough sleeper the church of england be work to provide long term secure housing for those who need it and pilot project to build housing on church land to enable that to happen church building and congregation can work well with local council to reduce rough sleeping by provide not only bed and meal but the opportunity for last spiritual and emotional support through membership of the church family what further support can the church of england offer parish in torbay that be undertake such work warmly congratulate all the church in torbay on the provision of the night shelter and single out in particular mark gridley and gary mitchell who know have be instrumental in lead that work be sure that the whole house be grateful for what they be do it be also typical of my hon friend that as understand it he provide sunday evening surgery at the shelter be sure that church across england could learn from that excellent initiative if any church would welcome conversation with the church of england about

to acknowledge the scottish government gender pay gap action plan the first in the uk which undoubtedly have help to achieve those welcome result the leader of the house government could take several step to help end the gender pay gap and advance equality right across these isle after repeatedly shelve the employment bill they could finally act to make workplace fair particularly in the current cost of living crisis which we know impact woman more they could legislate for mandatory gender and ethnicity pay gap reporting they could finally deliver compensation for waspi woman women against state pension inequality who have wait far too long to receive justice more broadly they could tackle the gender pension gap as yearly income among pensioner be on average more than low for woman

serve postmistress partington be an isolated community with low level of car ownership and appal public transport and of course its town centre bank have long since close it be several mile to the near main post office or for those without transport multiple hour round trip may we have debate in government time on the support available to post office in isolated community that do not qualify

scheme look at how service might be retain in the local community even if the brick and mortar of the post office have be stand down the next question to the department which think run that good

belarus sign into law provision impose more restriction on religious community will the leader of the house join in denounce that belarusian law and will she ask the foreign commonwealth and development office minister to take up the matter with the belarusian authority thank the hon gentleman for again shin spotlight this week on two appalling situation one in belarus and the other in

more extreme weather event will certainly ensure that the secretary of state have hear his concern which he may also wish to raise directly with the secretary of state on february civil nuclear road map with permission madam deputy speaker wish to make statement on civil nuclear power in the uk today we have publish three key document that reinforce the uk position as leader in the civil nuclear renaissance civil nuclear road map consultation on alternative route to market and consultation on propose policy for sit new nuclear power station that set we on path towards deploy up to gw of nuclear power in britain by as part of clean cheap and more secure energy system for the future it be the big investment in more than year in the civil nuclear road map we be set out our overarching strategy for the deployment of new nuclear reactor in the uk and how his majesty government intend to work with the nuclear sector to deliver that ambition the road map establish our vision for vibrant british nuclear sector provide detail on the policy that we be pursue to enable delivery cover area such as siting regulation financing the joint work that we be undertake with defence nuclear colleague to develop the require nuclear skill and supply chain in the uk and how we be take care of our nuclear legacy through policy on decommissioning and waste management announcement in the road map include commitment to reform the regulation financing and decommissioning of civil nuclear to make it more agile thereby streamline regulation while retain the uk world class standard of safety for example the measure that we be announce today could cut by up to the approval time for reactor that be already approve by overseas regulator we be also announce our commitment to reduce global dependence on russian fuel and to grow the uk supply chain by invest million alongside industry in the british production of clean green high assay low enrich uranium fuel for innovative new reactor thereby offer commercial alternative to russia for ourselves and our ally and partner the road map also set out our long term ambition for nuclear provide high level timeline and key decision point for wide range of nuclear technology over the next decade those technology include small modular reactor advanced modular reactor and gigawatt scale project include new commitment to explore further gigawatt scale nuclear project after sizewell advanced nuclear technology such as smr and amr present the opportunity to decarbonise across the energy sector from grid electricity through industrial heat to entirely new industry such as the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuel last year we set up great british nuclear as an arm length body responsible for help to deliver new nuclear project and lead our energy revolution but we be also keen to harness innovation in the private sector and help developer to bring forward new nuclear project outside of gbn ongoing smr selection process we be therefore today also launch our alternative route to market consultation that consultation which will run for week aim to understand where the government could support the private sector to bring forward advanced nuclear project finally in recognition of our enhance nuclear ambition and the exciting potential offer by advanced nuclear technology we be launch public consultation on propose new policy for the siting of new nuclear power station that consultation mark an important first step in the process for develop new nuclear national policy statement for england and wales and will run for eight week the result of the consultation will be use to inform the drafting of the national policy statement document which we intend to publish for further consultation the propose siting process announce today would of course apply only to england and wales although our ambition be for whole british nuclear revolution the current scottish government sadly remain committed to block any planning application for new nuclear in scotland under their devolved consent regime however we continue to invite the scottish government to join we and more than other country around the world to allow for reinvestment in and the renewal of our nuclear capacity across the whole uk in order to meet our net zero and energy security objective our intention be to designate the nps in subject of course to parliamentary process for the first time we intend for the nps to provide planning policy framework for smr and amr as well as the traditional gigawatt scale power station to achieve the uk nuclear ambition the government believe that additional site will be require for new nuclear project along with great ongoing flexibility in the site selection process to enable new technology we be excited to introduce positive shift in approach in the siting consultation the new nps will empower nuclear developer to identify potential site for development foster developer innovation and indeed flexibility although the exist designate nuclear site may possess many inherent positive attribute that potentially make they consideration for future development the change allow for the exploration of diverse new location by entrust developer with that responsibility we aim to streamline the process encourage creative solution and enhance the overall efficiency of nuclear development ultimately contribute to the growth and sustainability of the industry we propose that the siting of new nuclear would continue to be constrain by robust criterion that determine where development can occur developer would be empower to undertake the initial screening of site base on those criterion with advice from regulator and statutory agency of course it be our intention that safety will remain paramount with the high safety security and environmental standard oversee by the independent nuclear regulator and environment protection agency public consultation and community engagement will also remain essential part of the process this package this vision this announcement represent the big investment in nuclear in the uk for over year ensure our energy security keep we on the path to net zero and deliver the job of the future our nuclear future commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of his statement the energy bill crisis of the past two year have expose the deep vulnerability in britain energy system and the urgent need to build more home grow power in this country so that we can cut energy bill and have real energy independence from dictator such as putin in that context we support the government commitment to new nuclear power labour support new nuclear which must form critical part of our future energy mix nuclear power be long term project for any country and want to give the industry and nuclear worker clear assurance that there be cross party consensus for nuclear power in this country it be the last labour government who identify site for new nuclear in and in the time since this government record have be one of continual delay and false dawn yesterday meet people from west cumbria who have be wait six year for decision on nuclear since the last plan collapse on this government watch the road map publish today be two year later than they promise and it still leave number of unanswered question about how the government intend to turn warm word into practical action so shall ask the minister number of question first be glad that the minister have wake up to the urgent fact that we need to generate more cheap clean electricity in this country in which year will any of the policy announce today actually cut bill for people secondly it be all well and good talk about commitment to new station in the next parliament but what be the timetable for the final investment decision for sizewell the government promise to have final investment decision by the end of this parliament so will the minister give categorical promise today that that will be do time be run out thirdly will he update we on the timetable for hinkley point originally promise to be deliver by and when will it start supply power to household fourthly on smr what be the timetable for conclude the competition just yesterday meet representative try to site smr who be complain of long delay from government and the nuclear decommissioning authority in get the project move how will the minister unblock that and wide smr development fifthly what step be be take to ensure that the uk retain critical skill in our nuclear sector nuclear job be high skilled well pay and unionised job and labour support the worker and union in the nuclear industry in call on the government to ensure that investment in the industry support good job and apprenticeship right through the supply chain finally will the minister address the ongoing concern about the safety and security of our nuclear decommissioning process give the disturbing revelation about sellafield what step be be take to ensure that every nuclear site be secure labour support new nuclear for britain after year of inaction under the conservatives the wide lesson be that this country need government go full pelt for clean power we should be invest as country in nuclear offshore wind onshore wind solar hydrogen carbon capture and storage and all form of clean power that can help to cut bill and make our country energy independent that be what we need and that be what labour government will do be so pleased to hear the hon lady support for the conservative party policy regard nuclear give that we be invest in all of the above and more do welcome the support of the official opposition and their recent damascene conversion to the benefit of nuclear power but we should never forget in this place and beyond that any nuclear project in this country and any nuclear power station have be deliver only by conservative government it be record of which be very proud labour be in power for year and deliver nothing we be very proud today to be publish our civil nuclear road map as say it be important for the industry that there be cross party consensus and agreement that investment in nuclear be to the benefit of this country the economy and the environment and indeed will provide energy security and wean ourselves and our ally off our reliance on vladimir putin for our energy need the hon lady be absolutely right that deliver new nuclear power station will yield result for the british people and deliver clean bill in finland where nuclear power station be now deliver more than of energy on to the grid bill have drop by an incredible she ask about the final investment decision on sizewell we remain committed to make that decision by the end of this parliament on hinkley point we be in fact very proud of the progress that be be make just last month we see the dome be lift on to the top of reactor have nothing but admiration for the workforce and everybody involve in deliver that first of kind project at hinkley and we continue to support it the hon lady ask about the next phase of the small modular reactor competition it will be launch within week so ask she to bide her time and keep her patience we be very excited to have six fantastic technology company bid to deploy in the united kingdom and we be move fast than any comparable programme around the world to ensure that britain and the british people benefit from investment in small modular reactor and the benefit they can bring to the energy mix and to local economy the hon lady ask about skill one of the thing that the nuclear industry can bring and indeed deliver at this point be high skilled high wage job throughout the country and indeed in many place where those job be at premium it be absolutely right that we look at how we can encourage more people and make the space available within industry and in our educational institution to get more people into the job of the future in the nuclear industry that be why along with my hon friend the minister for defence procurement have launch the nuclear skill task force chair by sir simon bollom it will publish its initial finding and recommendation in the very near future as say welcome the new find support optimism and positivity for nuclear demonstrate by the labour party and when we as the conservative party go on to win at the next election be sure that the hon lady will continue to offer that support from the opposition benches call the chair of the science innovation and technology committee the committee that have the privilege of chairing publish big report on the future of nuclear power last year call for comprehensive strategy for new nuclear so warmly welcome the minister statement and the publication today which respond very comprehensively and substantially to many of the recommendation we make in particular welcome the commitment to new gigawatt scale nuclear as part of the gw target to streamline the regulation which be extremely important to small modular reactor and to the security that come from invest in our own domestic source of nuclear fuel those be very big step forward may ask the minister specifically to say whether the new site approval mechanism will allow these site to be use for smr by the deadline or target thank my right hon friend for his question and for all the work he have do to champion nuclear not only in his capacity as chair of the select committee but in his time as secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy when he be in charge of get this ship move to answer his question directly yes it will the new siting strategy will cover the possibility of the deployment of all technology smr amr and gigawatt scale reactor welcome my right hon friend support call the snp spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of his statement he be absolutely right in one respect the scottish government do not support the development of new nuclear power in scotland the reason for that be simple beside the environmental concern the economic do not lie nuclear power be slow to deliver and horrendously expensive and the policy of recent year under labour and conservative governments have be simply to allow private company to privatise the profit while the risk be socialise for taxpayer we on this side of the house at least on the snp benches all know that scotland comparative advantage lie in hydrogen and renewable both area in which the scottish government ambition appear to considerably outstrip those of the current uk government may ask the minister two simple question first despite his disagreement with the scottish government stance on planning and nuclear will he and his government respect the devolution settlement as it stand secondly will he give an undertaking as none of his predecessor over the last half century or more have be able to do that when the multibillion pound decommissioning liability become live for any new generation of nuclear power station they will lie squarely on the private company that have benefit in the precede decade and will not fall on the taxpayer the scottish national party like almost every nationalist party in the world have misplace belief in its own exceptionalism and nowhere be that more true than on nuclear at we see over country come together to pledge to increase civil nuclear capacity around the world by third so clear and obvious be it that nuclear be essential not just in ensure our energy security benefit local community and drive forward our economy but in reach our net zero goal and ensure that we have clean energy baseload in the future indeed there be no net zero without nuclear it pain especially as scottish member of parliament that the scottish government wrong head position on this remain extant would very much welcome change of direction within the scottish government urge the scottish national party to look around the world at the country join with we in this nuclear renaissance and revival and to think of the huge benefit that could be bring to scotland with its proud history in nuclear go back many decade if it be to join we on this journey of course we respect the devolution settlement we be absolutely committed to maintain it what urge though be change of direction change of approach and change of position by the scottish government so that the scottish people the scottish economy and the scottish environment can benefit from future investment in nuclear that will be feel in england and wales and indeed in so many other country around the world call the chair of the environmental audit committee today statement provide welcome clarity about the government road map for the delivery and revival of new nuclear energy capacity and will be write on behalf of my committee to the minister shortly to raise some point about the smr competition that he have touch on today notwithstanding the grudging support from those on the opposition front bench what step be my hon friend take to build the broad consensus behind this essential component of the delivery of net zero so that the road map do not fall victim to the short term thinking that bedevil the delivery of safe and effective renewal of nuclear capacity in the past notably under the previous labour government thank my right hon friend for his support of this document and for the work that he have do in chair the committee to drive forward the argument for further investment in nuclear know he share my belief that if we be to reach net zero nuclear will play large part in the mix of energy solution that we invest in my right hon friend be absolutely right that we need to build broad consensus genuinely welcome the support of the official opposition for new investment in nuclear as say when we look around the world the pace at which the mood be change and the broad acceptance of nuclear as key benefit in reach our net zero goal be incredible it will take lot of hard work on the part of all of we who believe in the benefit that nuclear can bring economically to our energy security and ultimately and most importantly to the environment to keep the pressure up look forward to his writing to and to discuss the issue that he have raise far and thank he once again for his broad support for what we be try to deliver may welcome the statement be go to commend the minister on the work that know he have do until he unfortunately become petty political think he spend bit too much time in scottish politic he will be aware that the small modular reactor assessment be already behind the government own timetable that be undermine rolls royce which build small reactor for the royal navy and have do for many decade meanwhile the formidable american political industrial machine be hoover up customer around the world can we not learn from the vaccine taskforce how to accelerate process while maintain safety will he now get move on so that we can build british modular nuclear reactor use british worker know the right hon gentleman would never stoop to petty politic in this chamber or anywhere else but have to disagree with he share his passion for small modular reactor and share his belief that rolls royce be world lead company that be deliver for this country right now and will continue to do so in future we be proud of the small modular reactor competition which we launch in july we have already complete the first process we have six world lead technology compete to get investment from the uk government for deployment here domestically of which rolls royce be of course part we will be launch the next phase in matter of week it be world lead and fast than any comparable programme in the world the right hon gentleman say to get move on but we have not stop to draw breath since we first launch gbn and the small modular reactor drawdown competition in the summer however welcome his support for what we be do and hope that he can encourage more of his colleague to support it today be fight back tear of joy and jubilation for this road map because it be absolutely clear that we have minister and government who be utterly commit to nuclear whether that be civil defence safe storage medical isotope or the entire supply chain may remind my hon friend the minister that the road map clearly refer to the the road between barrow and workington where the journey begin will he give his absolute assurance that he will remember where the journey begin with the commitment from my community and the community across furness and west cumbria and ensure that that be at the forefront of his decision making on future mission my hon friend she be friend be rightly proud of the contribution that cumbria have make to our nuclear journey over the last century the journey begin at calder hall and have continue she be right and at the forefront of our decision making will be the experience expertise and learning that have develop in and around her constituency which will of course be at the forefront of our nuclear renaissance congratulate my hon friend on his statement which be probably the most significant statement on energy policy for at least decade welcome in particular the intention to streamline planning process and regulation to reduce unnecessary cost and delay may ask for an assurance that if there be to be new nuclear development at bradwell in essex it will be of type that do not affect the marine protect area of the blackwater estuary historic oyster fishery on which many of my constituent depend thank my hon friend for his question and for his support at this exciting moment of course many site will be look at for future nuclear development and in every case they will have to adhere to the stringent strong and gold plat environmental standard that we expect of nuclear licensed site across the united kingdom do apologise for have call two member in row from the same side shall immediately correct myself by call two from the opposition side thank you madam deputy speaker take no offence at all it be fully understand the good route to affordable energy security be renewable nuclear power be blight by delay and rocket cost and the government be never honest about its much high cost compare with renewable on the government watch renewable have face long delay and the cost for offshore wind development have increase by will renewables road map soon follow the statement to address those challenge and ensure that the government do not lose their competitive advantage in offshore wind development lose track of where the liberal democrats sit on nuclear know that their current leader be against it then he be for it and then against it again right now be not quite sure do take issue with the hon lady insinuation that we be not lead the world in renewable we have the first second third fourth and fifth and soon the sixth large offshore wind farm in the world generating power right now for great britain we be invest at pace in solar and in host of new and emerge technology because unlike some party we believe that we should not invest all our time and money in one technology we need broad range of technology if we be ever to meet our legally bind net zero commitment look forward to the day when the liberal democrats can hold policy for more than five minute and come to the house and actually support we on the journey to our net zero future welcome the minister statement however what lesson will be learn from previous and current project on value for money the national audit office be scathing about some of the decision that have be take on those project what more can be do to support manufacturing in this area right across the uk build up the uk supply chain be essential one of the huge benefit that will be accrue through this big year investment in new nuclear be the ability to build up our manufacture base in the united kingdom create those high wage high skilled job that we want to see in more community around the entire country of course lesson will be learn from previous project we be always look at value for money for the british taxpayer which be why for example we be use the regulated asset base model for fund sizewell warmly welcome my hon friend announcement today because when the advanced gas cool reactor be decommission by we will have dip in nuclear production the public accounts committee of which have the honour to be deputy chair have do lot of work on this we recently have follow up visit to sellafield agree with my hon friend that they do fantastic work there but it be our large single project with minimum cost of billion over the next year will he undertake to renew our effort to get well handle on the decommissioning cost so that they can be properly allocate and we can have true estimate of what nuclear generation cost agree with my hon friend on the amazing work be conduct at sellafield in the constituency of my hon friend the member for copeland trudy harrison the lesson be learn through the decommissioning process at sellafield will yield benefit we be lead the way across the world on the decommissioning of site and be very happy to be advise other country on their decommissioning effort we need to ensure that any project run by the nuclear decommissioning authority be prove to be value for money and that we learn from the lesson of the past my party policy be to support the development of the present nuclear site in wales one of which be trawsfynydd in my constituency the welsh government have fund cwmni egino to develop trawsfynydd and million be allocate only last autumn for that purpose by the north wales growth deal to enable critical development and planning prior to the final investment decision to be make anon give the strategic development and investment in wales can the minister confirm that the entirely publicly own trawsfynydd with its potential job remain possible location for an smr in the near future will he please visit trawsfynydd would be delighted to visit the right hon lady constituency trawsfynydd have exciting potential as site for an smr and for other nuclear licensed activity it and many other be potential site for the deployment of these new technology in the year ahead as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on nuclear energy warmly welcome today publication of the long await civil nuclear road map in particular the exploration of alternative route to market for smr and amr outside the great british nuclear scheme on the delivery of large scale project be curious to know why the road map state on page that the government will need to wait for the sizewell final investment decision before they can set out timeline and process for new large scale project in the uk that formal work and engagement in the minister team need not wait on the work of another team over which he do not have control or oversight in the spirit of speed up delivery might he begin this work now in readiness for maximise the time we have leave before to get this do the hon lady can be assure that work be already begin on identify future site for large scale gigawatt power station we be commit to announce more in due course may add my intense excitement for this announcement and in particular for the inclusion of advanced modular reactor in the road map finally we have way forward for they my hon friend know how important it be to to get an amr in hartlepool he be with on his first ever visit to hartlepool on the day that we announce two year extension for our reactor which take we to do this announcement mean what think it do the guarantee of future for nuclear at hartlepool be it only matter of time before he come back to announce not only what we will build there but who will build it and when remember that visit distinctly my first as the nuclear minister thank the hon lady and everyone who host nuclear power station in their constituency for champion that industry the sector and the workforce the workforce and the sector have be widely castigate in the popular mindset over many year but now be reap the reward of continue support from people such as my hon friend and other in this house be delighted that hartlepool get the extension the road map that we set out today will deliver clear identification of what can be deliver where and how that mean bright future for nuclear in hartlepool nova innovation in my constituency recently announce the wonderful news that it have win million of investment from the eu to lead pan european consortium to create the seastar tidal energy farm in orkney the large tidal energy site in the world why do the uk government continue to largely ignore this safe low cost reliable form of energy as greenpeace point out the energy industry itself know that the economic case for slow expensive nuclear just do not add up tidal receive money for the very first time through the last auction round in the contract for difference process this government be invest in tidal technology wind solar hydrogen carbon capture and storage continued exploration for oil and gas which the hon lady party oppose and nuclear of course it be fantastic news for her constituent and the business around scotland that be win contract to invest in renewable what to their shame scottish national party representative in this place never mention be the hundred of thousand of job in scotland that depend on the nuclear industry manufacturing construction education and the fantastic work go on right now in torness the only generate power station in scotland currently deliver power to million home perhaps the scottish national party will come to the chamber and explain how when that power station close down as sadly and inevitably one day it will they will replace the power generate for scottish home under their plan to completely ignore this safe secure and clean option for secure future energy welcome the civil nuclear road map in particular the recognition that we will need additional nuclear site to those in the exist policy framework do the minister agree that there be one big difference between gigawatt reactor and an smr gigawatt reactor be very big and smr be comparatively quite small therefore do he believe that we need to consider small site such as dungeness in my constituency which could be very suitable for such technology as smr again welcome my hon friend support and thank he for host on visit to dungeness the fish and chip be exquisite agree that we will look at every site and possible site and judge they on the basis of what type of technology could be build there that will benefit his community community around the country and the united kingdom more widely thank the minister for his statement it be great that the government have outline plan for the big expansion of nuclear power in year to reduce energy bill which so many of our constituent struggle with on daily basis minister ask you this question because you admit that northern ireland order the hon gentleman know that he should not refer directly to the minister let we have another go apology madam deputy speaker what provision do the uk civil nuclear plan include to involve northern ireland how will it ensure that the region perspective and concern be adequately take into account in the development and implementation of nuclear politic and policy so that we can create job and strengthen our economy at the same time as other area in the united kingdom as ever the hon gentleman champion his constituent and the people and economy of northern ireland it be essential to that every part of our united kingdom benefit from this once in generation investment into new nuclear would be delighted to meet he to discuss how northern ireland and his constituent in strangford could benefit from investment in skill and the supply chain deployment of nuclear capability be devolved competency but would be happy to meet he to see what his constituent can get from this historic announcement from anglesey all the way up the coast to the tip of cumbria the north west nuclear arc will be as some member have already suggest dance little jig today springfield in lancashire be the geographic and would argue fuel production heart of that north west nuclear arc welcome this announcement to secure the future million investment to ensure that vladimir putin do not have his hand on the tap of advanced nuclear fuel that be so important for the hundred if not thousand of people who live in south ribble and work in the adjacent springfields this investment help lancashire support the uk domestic nuclear industry but can the minister tell if there be opportunity for export lancashire nous skill capability and fuel to the world absolutely lancashire like cumbria be at the heart of the vision we be announce today the million investment in new nuclear fuel mean that the united kingdom will remain among handful of nation commit and able to work across the entire fuel supply chain the secretary of state for energy security and net zero be visit springfields as speak demonstrate our commitment to that plant and its people move forward we will be central to our ally and partner around the world be able to move away from and wean themselves off rely on hostile foreign actor like vladimir putin for their energy baseload lancashire will be key to do that nuclear be hugely important for our energy security so welcome today statement miss from my atomic friend extensive list of the benefit of nuclear be how much kind nuclear be on land use with small modular reactor need just two football pitch to produce enough power for around million home compare to acre of solar that will power only home do the minister agree that nuclear be so much kind and do not involve destroy vast swathe of the british countryside and impact our food security my hon friend be absolutely right about the footprint and the comparable impact on land of nuclear compare to other technology but it be very important that we have wide range of energy technology move forward we will benefit from investment in wind solar hydrogen ccus and the nuclear we be announce today but welcome his support for what we be announce welcome the statement and the publication of the three document with sizewell as well as offshore wind and hydrogen east anglia suffolk and lowestoft will play vital strategic role in enhance our energy security keep bill low and drive forward the transition to net zero to enable the local area to play this lead role to the maximum advantage of local people and local business do my hon friend recognise the vital importance of investment in skill at east coast college and investment in infrastructure such as in the port of lowestoft absolutely my hon friend be spot on be very happy to visit east anglia last year and see for myself the investment sizewell be make in the local community and in local college support young people who want to get into the new high skilled job that will be produce through the development of project such as sizewell be very happy to announce that will be visit east anglia again on monday to see the progress that have be make at sizewell he be absolutely right that the benefit that accrue locally through investment in nuclear at large scale and at small modular scale be unprecedented that be one of the thing that hope come out of today yes we be talk about our energy security and yes we be talk about reach net zero but the impact locally to community through investment in new nuclear be unprecedented be very excited to see what it bring in the year ahead welcome the minister statement clearly nuclear will have major part to play in energy generation in coming year number of company have already look at site in my northern lincolnshire constituency which he will know be major centre for the renewable energy sector he speak of encourage developer to identify potential site do he agree with that it be also important that local authority play part in encourage this type of development can assure he that north lincolnshire council and north east lincolnshire council will welcome such development completely agree local authority have key role in drive forward interest and investment in small modular reactor and advanced modular reactor and indeed in any new technology that come through as the result of today announcement and the investment we be make in nuclear would be delighted to visit his constituency and see the potential of possible site for small modular reactor deployment in the area he represent because he be absolutely right the potential for these technology be huge not just as have say for our energy security move forward but for the benefit they bring to community up and down the length and breadth of the united kingdom backbench business send provision and funding relevant document petition increase funding for special educational need and disability send education petition fund more specialist school place for child with special educational need petition make send train mandatory for all teaching staff petition require school senco to be fully qualified for the role petition require all school staff receive training on sen child and petition more funding for sen child to access appropriate school provisions would just like to explain to colleague how we intend to proceed this afternoon we have two very well subscribe debate and will try to ensure that all back benchers have fairly equal opportunity across the afternoon the guidance be that the open speech be to be between and minute advise that in order to be fair to everybody we will start off with the guidance that six minute will allow everybody an equal opportunity from the back benches if people can not stick to that will have to put on time limit but think that will ensure that everybody get good chance to contribute beg to move that this house call for review of funding for send provision thank you madam deputy speaker will try my absolute good to stay inside your guidance we have applicant to speak in the debate which think be record so forgive if do not take intervention nearly people sign petition relate to these subject and be pleased to say that they will have their voice hear in the chamber today the debate about how good to cater for those with special educational need and disability be often dominate by hard number money place headcount and so on that be obviously vital part of the discussion but the real heart of the matter be the human impact and the child and family behind the figure my part of the world the east riding have the low per capita funding which be about third of the highest fund area declare an interest or more than an interest prejudice have grandchild who suffer from something call genetic disease that make her non verbal and give her daily fit and seizure so she have very high intensity of requirement in the two year of covid she miss day of teaching over and above lockdown requirement because of lack of resource that be eight week of schooling lose cause enormous distress to child who need continuity and stability we can see immediately how that have an effect chloe have complex need and meet those need be daily challenge for her parent and teacher for she to miss so much school be simply awful and put huge pressure on chloe herself and on the rest of her family as important as chloe be to the point be that her case be not unusual many of her classmate have and continue to have the same experience as do thousand upon thousand of child across the country parent teacher teaching assistant mental health worker carer and host of other do incredible work to ensure that child get as much help as possible but they be struggle to provide adequately for everyone at the moment the resource be simply not there bit of background here be important education health and care plan ehcp as they be know be introduce in this be well intentione reform that seek to provide holistic support for young people in need but what the reform fail to do be provide resilience in the system to deal with future change to demand for service in recent year there have be huge increase in that demand population growth well detection of condition such as autism and long life expectancy because of medical progress all put pressure on the system as result the total number of ehcp and statement of special educational need have more than double since that be rise of more than quarter of million case with large increase in every age group but the funding from central government simply have not keep pace part of the answer be to update the funding formula the exist allocation of fund be base on an out of date assessment of each area special educational need of course some level of differentiation of funding make sense as not every area have the same need for example rurality have huge impact as staff campaigner and family in my area know only too well those national pressure lie behind the call by the group represent local authority with some of the bad rate of send funding for billion in additional annual funding from central government the figure be base on that huge growth in the number of ehcp local authority have to support as well as significant inflationary pressure each ehcp tailor to the specific need of child require additional support cost the local authority cash so the more ehcp be need the more local authority have to cough up and the great the pressure on their already tight finance we should remember that in the past two year six local authority have already declare themselves effectively bankrupt the impact of these pressure on send provision be clear for all to see in less than half of ehcp be issue within week of application in other word one in two child wait more than five month give that of child have special educational need that be huge number of kid wait for help and many have to wait lot long to get the support that they need in some case child have to be send to school far away owe to lack of local place and family struggle over and above their normal need to get appropriate support parent and carer have supply with many illustrative example one jennifer say that we have be on waiting list for month for my son to see speech and language therapist the lack of sen school need address as matter of urgency as child be be let down and be suffer another esther say my son have have his ehcp meet in four year in an sen school he have not have speech therapy for over three year nor have he have his physio occupational therapy sensory or educational need meet there be urgent need for more funding so that sen school can have appropriate class size with therapist and enough qualified and skilled support staff accord to one special need specialist teacher louise service such as speech and language therapy have be reduce dramatically in my autism spectrum condition resource provision class we use to have three hour per week and now have three hour per half term another teacher catherine say we have large number of child who require specialist support to allow they to thrive and stay safe owe to lack of resource however other child be receive minimal support as we be firefighte just to keep the child safe the financial impact of all this be of course enormous the cumulative deficit in local authority high need budget be estimate to be billion and be expect to reach billion by march there be more than local authority with large high need deficit currently those deficit be be keep off local authority balance sheet by statutory override but the override be time limited and will expire in if it be not extend if and when it do expire many council will be bankrupt overnight with huge implication not just for education but for all local service that be why the group consider the expiry to be sword of damocles hang over the entire sector fifty five local authority have have to sign up to the government deliver well value in send programme and have have to sign up to the safety valve programme both set up to meet the challenge of deal with the rise demand and cost which mean that nearly authority have already have to go to the government for help of course it be also crucial that we be able to plan for future challenge so that we can meet they when they arise rather than constantly firefighte with limited resource to that end there need to be substantial increase in capital funding to allow local authority to invest in send project say to the minister that the recent announcement of billion for that purpose be welcome but more be need without the start up cash we will simply find ourselves in another crisis in five year time the number may sound big and we all know that these be straiten time for the economy after covid but in reality fail to invest be false economy we might save some money in the short term but the long term cost both to the budget and to the child concern be huge let we take an example child suffer from poor physical and mental health suicidal ideation and poor school attendance spend great deal of time refuse to engage at all special need staff have set out an action plan give he one to one mentoring support thrice weekly pastoral session regular counselling and organise work experience as result his school attendance improve he begin to develop friendship with peer and he be able to manage full school timetable his life be transform the reverse scenario however happen all too often as mo speech and language therapist put it it be widely acknowledge that early intervention be key however due to lack of funding staffing level and subsequent long waiting list we be unable to provide that intervention child might say have autism and anxiety and might be struggle to get into school and struggle to cope with the day work without help those thing get bad the child come to school less they find it hard and hard to carry out basic task their friendship suffer and it be then more difficult for special need staff to get through to they ultimately they will need much great and more expensive effort to reintegrate they into schooling and will require much more long term care intervene early be transformative and that require resource to make it possible to act before problem spiral out of control further problem be the severe workforce difficulty that send employer face specialist teaching assistant for example now cost employer about each up from about year ago however the place funding have be not change from per child so we be not match that extra demand many send worker would be well remunerate in less skilled job and in challenging economic climate they may be force to vote with their foot one therapist hayley say that she have see huge decline in skill and knowledge of the workforce that will not come as surprise to anyone in the sector of course minister say they value the work that send staff do but it must be back up by funding otherwise the workforce will continue to dwindle with dire consequence for those who rely on their support there be many other aspect that should like to mention but you want to be sharp madam deputy speaker so will not deal with most of they these challenge extend to further education young people age to make up of those with ehcp and know that some of my colleague will want to touch on that moreover as have say this be not simply matter of funding just this week the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for finchley and golders green mike freer recognise the need for systemic reform because family be wait between nine and month for hearing after appeal against ehcp decision be sure that some of my colleague will go far into these issue in their speech and will mention their own experience of help family in their constituency my right hon friend and neighbour the member for east yorkshire sir greg knight can not be here this afternoon because of constituency engagement but know that he agree with all the point have make front benchers who can not contribute to the debate also have their concern know that my right hon and learn friend the member for banbury victoria prentis have like many other be contact by numerous constituent about this subject and have take their worry on board the same be true of other ministers who do not particularly want to mention they can not think why the bottom line be this the support that society provide for its most vulnerable be measure of its compassion and to my mind measure of its civilisation that be the key be sure that the government share those principle but now we must find way to deliver the change that be need to make they reality it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis who do superb job of set out the strategic argument for more funding for those with special educational need hope that we will get some hint from ministers that the chancellor of the exchequer have hear the call from parent across the country and that more revenue funding and crucially more capital funding will be make available want to raise series of parochial issue that be nevertheless relevant to the more strategic argument advance by the right hon gentleman let say at the outset that entirely recognise from my own casework the story of parent and their difficulty in obtain support for their child with special educational need be sure that be the experience of everyone in this house at the outset acknowledge the skill and commitment of those who work with and teach child with special educational need both in my constituency and across the country teacher be remarkable at the good of time but like other school staff they be not value enough they be fundamental to the future of our country and to the future of the vulnerable young people we be talk about today be fortunate that harrow be bless with good special school alexandra school in south harrow in my constituency be particularly good but shaftesbury high school kingsley high school and woodlands school be also very effective commend their staff to the house also acknowledge the impressive performance of special educational need co ordinator and other staff who support young people in harrow mainstream school setting there be clear need for new place special school in harrow the four special school mention face serious financial difficulty and more investment be need for the young people in harrow mainstream school to get the support they need harrow have see increase in the number of young people with ehcp over the last five year and harrow council estimate that the figure be likely to increase by about year the four special school in harrow have just under place between they but young people year from my community be be place in special school the council already rely on find placement for vulnerable child with special educational need in out of borough school and private special school that be far away from their family setting as understand it harrow already have much great reliance on private sen school than the national average there be very little space to expand the borough four special school and harrow be unfortunately surround by neighbour borough that be also see very significant increase in the number of young people with significant special educational need pressure be also rise fast on the private and independent school cater for those with special educational need on which harrow might draw that mean that much high proportion of harrow high need budget be be spend on significantly more expensive placement than would be spend if an additional special school be build in the borough as understand it my council be now worried that there will be far significant fee increase for those school place even great pressure on the exist special need budget the department for education have turn down harrow application for special school three time even though the department accept that it be an effective bid and worthy of funding have funding be available hence the urgent need for more capital funding finally underline the point that special school in harrow and suspect across the country be already face serious financial problem understand that the national network of specialist provision have reveal that of special school respond to its survey report budget deficit in year one of their financial cycle rise to in year two the average size of that deficit be in year one which have huge implication for school budget that need to be urgently address in the forthcoming budget call the chair of the education committee it be great pleasure to speak in this hugely important debate be very grateful to the backbench business committee for provide time and to the petitions committee for organise and manage many of the important petition to which it relate some of which hope to address congratulate my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis on champion this vital campaign have work alongside he on one or two challenging issue over the year now have the pleasure of do so again support his motion for three key reason as we have hear member across the house have huge case load relate to special educational need as chairman of the education committee and as long stand and commit supporter of and its campaign for fair funding think that get the right support to child with special educational need and disability be vital challenge and we have to be frank that it be challenge with which successive government have struggle the committee praise the aim of the reform but it conclude in that their implementation have not be effective and that funding be wholly inadequate it be to the government great credit that high need funding have since increase substantially more than double since and increase by since the start of this parliament there have be real focus on provide more specialist place but while it be undoubtedly true that this government have prioritise the need of sen child in spending review it be also true that the real and substantial increase have not be enough to meet demand the vast majority of local authority be face high need deficit worcestershire be by no mean among the bad but it have tell that it expect its deficit to rise from million at the end of march to million next year not only be specialist and mainstream setting in every constituency struggle to meet the demand of the parent and family that they do accommodate but as my right hon friend make clear in his granddaughter case too many child be not in those setting when they ought to be the education committee have hear that non elective home education be too prevalent in this space it be therefore right that we use this debate to press for more resource for what be legally and morally meeting of basic need and the fundamental right to education pay tribute as other have to the incredible work happen in every single school in my constituency to support child with special educational need and disability say every single school because it be clear that sen child and child with ehcp be spread across the entire school estate mainstream as well as specialist hear from teacher and leader in mainstream primary school early year setting secondary sixth form and college and almost without exception they speak about observe rise level of need and complexity of need that be even more acute in specialist setting which some year ago be deal with few highly complex case of child with multiple and severe condition alongside large number of child with single diagnosis today an increase proportion of their intake be take up by those with multiple and severe condition and both regency high school and fort royal community primary school in my constituency have describe the pressure that create we should all be support the incredible parent and carer who support sen child while recognise as the government green paper and white paper have that the current system have be source of frustration and confrontation for they we should be support the aspiration of the green paper and the white paper to deliver the right support in the right place at the right time but to do so will require the scale of resource and investment in training infrastructure and need base funding for which this debate be call there be brilliant people provide support to send child across the country but the rise tide of demand for specialist support need to be acknowledge from the start that be why the case for more funding as well as fairer funding be really important ahead of this debate prepare detailed and instructive briefing set out that the area that have among the low overall school funding also have among the low extra funding for high need for the record worcestershire have the low overall funding and the low high need funding that position have improve since but it still put our school pupil and particularly our special need pupil at huge disadvantage compare with those with exactly the same need in well fund area know that the department for education draft legislation to take the next step in deliver on our manifesto promise of fairer funding formula by make dedicated school grant payment directly to school rather than through local authority but that the legislation fall victim to the demise of the late schools bill ask the minister for an update on when the department plan to take that crucial next step today be call not for reallocation but for grow the size of the pie and for do so with urgency that call have be back by the national education union the association of school and college leaders the national association of head teachers the early years alliance and the national governance association which all agree that the high need block require an extra billion year just to prevent the current crisis in high need from get bad that have be estimate through the growth in the number of ehcp since the substantial revenue funding ask in today motion be only part of the solution we also need to reduce lengthy journey which have place huge strain on home to school transport budget but do nothing for the welfare of child my local authority like many other be see huge increase in its home to school transport budget that be contribute to another grow deficit put more pressure on local family and other service although appreciate that the department for education be not the funder for those budget joint work with the department for levelling up housing and communities to ensure that they be properly fund and effectively use be vital we need to ensure that the worthy aspiration set out in the last spending review settlement the billion to provide new place be not just deal with as one off it need to be continue in future spending review with that in mind be very grateful for the investment that have go into new all through specialist autism school in the neighbouring constituency of my hon friend the member for west worcestershire harriett baldwin however know that my primary special school fort royal and my secondary special school regency be desperately in need of expansion we need to see that capital continue to come and we desperately need new specialist assessment centre for the early year in worcester spend to save in this area be very important and the government have rightly set out to halve the disability employment gap my committee inquiry on career education highlight how sen child could benefit from more support in advice and guidance on their career very much agree with what my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden say about the importance of speech and language therapy and investment in that area support the call for send in the specialist campaign last year and be glad that the government have respond positively to number of those but we also need to look at auditory verbal therapy teacher of the deaf and the number of child psychologist and paediatrician in our health and care team some area that go beyond the education budget need to be look at in this respect briefly wish to touch on some of the petition in support of this motion that relate to training for sen they be very important and welcome the fact that the government have make some move to include more sen content in the initial teacher training curriculum urge they also to look at the early career framework in that respect and that echo some of the call that my select committee have make petition call for great qualification for senco and for we to set high bar for their expertise and training my committee have welcome the government commitment to national professional qualification for senco and hear some positive information on the number of people take the level qualification the under secretary of state for education my hon friend the member for wantage david johnston who be on the front bench today write to we in october to say we have increase funding for an additional senco to be train take the total up to the project be on track to train minimum of senco by august can he confirm that that trajectory be be maintain this be hugely challenging and important area it would not only ease large and grow financial burden affect every local authority up and down the country but particularly benefit child with send and their family if the aspiration set out in this motion could be deliver therefore commend it to the whole house rise thank the two open speaker for be nearly within time remind member that my guidance be that they should speak for six minute call ian lavery we can be say to be decent and humane society only if we have do our utmost to provide help and support for the most vulnerable child in our community we should be able to proclaim not only that we provide for reasonable level of material wellbee for such child but that we be also allow they access to the education they need to better their life on both count this government have fail but one of their most glaring failure be the failure to provide the necessary funding for the educational requirement of child with special educational need and disability be my hon friend as concerned as be about the regional inequality in respect of both the prevalence of ehcp and the inadequate resourcing that reflect this particular need thank my hon friend for that very clear intervention and will deal with that point later in my contribution as nation we generally fail to make education provision the priority that it deserve to be we can develop modern and diverse economy only if we have people with the necessary skill and knowledge that such an economy require most importantly our working class child will continue to be hold back if we do not prioritise the proper funding of our school and further education college shamefully the uk spend only of our national income on education compare with the average of spend by oecd member when one consider the financial resource provide for the educational need for pupil with send one see that the underfunding be even more pronounced accord to the organisation which represent the local authority with the low amount of education funding an additional billion for baseline funding be require to make up that shortfall without this additional spending child with send will not find the place they deserve in either mainstream or specialist school yet at time when more send funding be so desperately need the funding be actually decrease in september my local authority northumberland county council report that the number of ehcp in northumberland be increase by per year increase need should of course be meet by increase funding but central government have increase the element for send funding within their grant to the council by only indeed over the past four year there have be growth of in the number of ehcp while fund from the dfe have increase by only be unbelievable in for the first time the northumberland school high need block will overspend expectation for april be even bad and there will be minus deficit at the minimum on positive note there be more learner with send have their need well meet in northumberland school than ever before that be testament to the fantastic work of the school and local authority staff who be find way to continue amid the chaos but they be be stretch to the limit want to pay tribute to the staff pupil and parent at the dales school cleaswell hill school collingwood school and castle school among other in my constituency which continue to do fantastic job shockingly however the amount per send child per year allocate by the government be an amount that have be freeze for year cost pressure on all school have increase greatly yet the amount per child with send have remain frozen for more than decade that be astonishing many child with send can only attend school that have the physical environment that be appropriate for they that require ensure that their school have at all time the adjustment in layout and mean of access that these child must have some student with send also need specialist electronic education equipment and it provision those need can be meet only with adequate capital spending last summer the government announce billion of increase capital funding for the support of specialist provision yet that have to be assess within the context of the cut in devolve school capital funding that be make in at the time of the tory and liberal democrat coalition government which of course have lead to the current school repair bill of billion this increase also do not reflect the recent inflation in construction cost and it be grossly inadequate it also have to be remember that when local authority be unable to provide their own place for child with send they often have to pay for expensive private school to take they put further strain on their budget student age to with send need access to further education in order to enrol in the course they want and to maximise their full potential both academically and in their future employment prospect there be specialist further education college for some student with send which be more costly for local authority and do not have adequate place to meet demand those fe college may be good for some but many would benefit from enrol in mainstream further education there be wide social issue at stake parent who can not find specialist place for their child with send be often force to care for their child at home as recently report by the bbc that can take its toll on such family in term of both finance and mental health the parent can find themselves isolate stress and depressed moreover they be unable to work and in many case be force to rely on benefit instead of concentrate on help family by increase funding so that child can attend school that meet their need the prime minister this weekend seem to be interested only in deprive the sick and disabled of their benefit in conclusion we have to address the lack of fair funding for send school there can not be any further cut or delay it may be helpful if actually put the clock on or else other member wish to speak will have their time cut down be sure the clock will be very helpful madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to follow the hon member for wansbeck ian lavery and pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure this important debate will start with something that be unusual in this place mea culpa serve on the bill committee for what become the children and families act we debate education health and care plan at length and how we aspire to their make real difference we think they would make difference by bring together education health and social care funding enable the child we be speak about to have the opportunity to thrive and achieve everything that we know they can and need to achieve sadly remember the word fight recur again and again in that debate parent be tired of fight for the right school place for statement which would later become an ehcp or for the right transport to get their child to the education set they need we think that act would see an end to the fighting but it simply have not because that have again be the recur word that parent from my constituency have use in email to when tell they that plan to speak in this debate they be still tired still fight and still see child make no progress in range of setting across our constituency whether they be specialist or mainstream provision as the chair of the education committee my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker say the sad truth be that those parent be wear out to reinforce that point lady call jill mothersdale in sedgefield come to and say exactly that they be so tired of try to fight the system and get result it be not anywhere but everywhere and endorse the comment make by my right hon friend my hon friend be right that it be everywhere mother contact about her two daughter one of whom she say have make no progress in her school setting for year and be be allow to sit at the back of the classroom make no contribution she will not pass her gcse and more than likely will never move into employment it be about transition child have to be give the opportunity to achieve the maximum they can so that they will go on to perform useful role in society and in work and so that the child of today be not the problem of the department for work and pensions tomorrow or bad the problem of the ministry of justice that be the stark reality as my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden say we need change do not want my contribution to be entirely negative although fear may get bit pokey and political at some point want to talk about brilliant school in my constituency st edward school in melchet park specialist school for boy with emotional and mental health challenge with particular social need it be private school the sole customer of which be local education authority any increase in the fee of that school will be an increase for local authority and the hard press taxpayer st edward school do brilliant job the year before last visit the school on international women day and year old boy ask what be do to celebrate the day in my role have forget it be international women day which be absolutely shameful but he have not plant tree at the school with young man call jacob who make properly laugh despite all the challenge he face because he be in setting that be safe secure and appropriate for his emotional and behavioural need my hon friend the chair of the select committee be right to refer to transport because that school transport child in every single morning and out every afternoon over massive distance they come from across the whole of hampshire some of the kid be sit in taxi for well over an hour at both end of the day the school wish to extend the residential offering so that the child can have the same stability and security in the extended day as they get in their school hour it be particularly important for child with social and emotional need to have consistency and certainty about how their day will pan out it might be awkward for those of different political persuasion to recognise that charitable part of the private sector be produce the good for young people and make sure that those boy be get the security they need but we have to face up to that will finish on point about special educational need that be often overlook and challenge that we all face girl on the autistic spectrum be often much well than their male counterpart at mirror the behaviour of their classmate and mask their condition as result they be less likely to get the ehcp that they desperately need we have to make sure that we do not overlook that and recognise that there can be difference across the sex in the way condition present we have to make sure that diagnosis be easy to get for girl who in too many instance will be stick in mainstream setting because their ehcp have not be grant because they have be much well at mask their additional need to conclude thank my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden and backbench business committee for grant the debate it be important that we recognise that the change we make in the act have not give we the change that we need and we must do well thank the backbench business committee on which serve many year ago and the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for bring forward this important debate that so many member be present show the importance of send education to our young people people be disable by barrier in society not by difference child with special educational need and their family in leeds north west be consistently make to feel that they be the problem the system be complete mess there be huge shortage of specialist provision and enhance mainstream provision so child be force into school that do not have the expertise to manage their need that lead to exclusion isolation and child be withdraw support staff do not have adequate training or care and many be pay less than those work in supermarket the number of child with special educational need and disability who be either exclude or wait for place at school have jump by almost third since the severe delay in child receive ehcp mean that family in leeds north west have be leave in the dark for month about which secondary school their child will attend that be especially distress for child with autism who often struggle with routine change and would benefit massively from know where they will be place one of my constituent tell that it take until the end of year for their child to receive an ehcp which be far too late to secure place for specialist provision for year only this december in year have my constituent son be able to secure place in specialist provision that be three year too late he will never be able to get back those year of his childhood spend struggle with no support for his complex need early intervention be non existent in many hospital an initial appointment at child development centre have waiting list of more than month but after wait month it be not really early intervention any more be it health visitor be unable to identify child who need speech and language therapy intervention because they only have time to visit for child protection although child protection be vital we need holistic approach for child child and adolescent mental health service be on their knee leeds camhs be take on only the most egregious case as it have huge waiting list massive underfunding and workforce crisis it be estimate that only one in four child who need help for mental health issue obtain access to camhs service wish to look briefly at some positive example of provision in leeds recently visit two setting with my right hon friend the member for leeds central hilary benn we go to specialist lighthouse school for young people with autism in my constituency and to the vine which be part of leeds city college in my right hon friend constituency have one of the most challenging and interesting question and answer session with group of young people the first question put to be what be the meaning of life as be sure all member here know that be not the normal question we would get when we go to school session what be your answer my answer be reference douglas adams which all the young people understand far well than they be very bright and articulate bunch but they be there because of the school and the additional support that it provide lighthouse be struggle for funding it be charity so as well as the funding that it receive it get additional funding and support from charitable mean but that should not be how school operate it should be able to survive and thrive on statutory funding the vine be specialist facility for profound and multiple learn difficulty with very challenging cohort of young people many of whom be non verbal the family we speak to be so grateful for the provision but we need so much more its facility include hydrotherapy pool rebound facility and sensory perception room it be the only place in leeds that offer such facility so it attract people from mile away make sure that we have suitable school and service for these child should be priority but unfortunately due to the government abandonment of funding for local authority leeds city council do not have the budget to manage and enhance these school place this be not just systematic let down to knowingly force child into school placement that we know be not right for they or simply to accept the fact that they will not receive any education at all be neglect and be afraid the neglect of vulnerable child amount to abuse what pleasure and privilege it be to have the opportunity to speak today thank the backbench business committee and my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure the debate like many wish to start by thank not just our specialist school tor view belmont school cribden house school and crosshill school in darwin but all the school in my constituency that support child with special educational need see my hon friend the member for bury north james daly in his place he be the minister parliamentary private secretary so he will not get the opportunity to speak today but know that he be huge campaigner on this issue in his adjoining constituency many of those school will be share between we to support our constituent come to this debate as parent of non verbal six year old who have an ehcp the experience we be talk about today and the struggle that parent face have be the experience and the struggle of my wife and as we try to navigate the system on behalf of our son which be why be so grateful to have the opportunity to speak in this debate want to ask every colleague in the chamber to do favour for my son and other parent with child who have autism and other additional need there be brilliant organisation in my constituency call spectrum of light which be run by julie nixon who have give so much of her time to support the parent of child with additional need we team up to hold an additional need autism and special need fair bring together all the council include lancashire county council and blackburn with darwen borough council and the support group into one room and ask parent of child with additional need to come along it be the most fulfilling and rewarding thing have do as member of parliament for at least decade it be our job to help people to help parent know that many colleague across the house support apprenticeship fair and job fair we all try to support our constituent we have parent attend our fair have parent contact from cumbria who want to attend this be something that we as mps can do we can all support parent who like and my wife have really have to struggle to get the support that they need for their child as members of parliament we can make difference by come and talk in this debate it be hugely important debate we can also make difference by use our office to support parent the fair that we hold make such difference to all the parent who attend just hope that this be something that we can all do on cross party basis it do not matter what party we be from this be just about do good work and roll it out across our constituency if anyone want to contact about how to do it be more than happy to deal with the inquiry that autism special need and additional need fair in lancashire demonstrate to that we have real challenge in service the demand of people like and other parent recently visit east lancashire adolescent centre at burnley general teaching hospital because it have be give national quality network for community camhs accreditation award the lead psychiatrist tell that there have be increase in the number of child present with diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder since the covid lockdown the centre be try to service that additional need without any additional funding and that in particular be why this debate be so important it speak to the challenge that other council face do not criticise anyone at lancashire county council or blackburn with darwen borough council they be do brilliant job but they be very very push spectrum of light and recently hold teleconference for parent who be struggle to receive an ehcp will talk about some of those conversation sarah rossendale resident say that the deadline for the completion of her ehcp be december she have have no appointment with the educational psychologist her seven year old son be rarely at school he have attend school for only hour since september hannah another rossendale resident have three child who be currently try to get an ehcp her daughter have adhd and be struggle in school through isolation but she can not get an ehcp her son have autism and can not get an ehcp they both attend school in my constituency in fact all three of her child attend school in my constituency the challenge or the blockage seem to be the lack of availability of educational psychologist to push through these ehcp to support parent as well as ask every colleague to contact my office which my staff will not thank for want each of we to hold fair to support parent who like have child with additional need and really need help my big ask of the government not just for lancashire but for authority across the country be to find way to increase the number and availability of educational psychologist we can not ration ehcp through waiting list that be not the intention it be not what the government want to do but it be in practice what be happen on the ground because of the lack of educational psychologist my ask of the minister hope he will deal with this in his summation at the end of the debate be to please find way to support council to fast track ehcp that would make difference ehcp do work when people get they know that it work for my family and my son the challenge be that people just can not get they in timely manner it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for rossendale and darwen sir jake berry while can not speak from personal experience in the way he movingly have hope to shed light on some of the issue through example that have come across around the country and in my constituency one of the reason be in this place be that be passionate about child and firmly believe that every child no matter their background or need can achieve great thing as we have hear too many vulnerable child be not get the support that they need to thrive and achieve their potential and too many parent be fight an adversarial system because of the grow demand and the lack of resource ehcp be inevitably be ration in the way that we have hear we have hear about the grow number of council with high need deficit that be why the local government association say that the government have not go far enough in address the cost and demand pressure since there have be an upward trend in the number of child with special educational need but in the same period the number of speech and language therapist vacancy have soar in my constituency special school tell that they just can not recruit the teaching assistant they need there be also lot of pressure on staff in mainstream school hear that week in and week out from school in my constituency go to visit coppice valley primary school in harrogate in october where have long chat with the leadership team about send issue heartbreakingly the school send lead who be passionate about his job and brilliant at it be leave his job because he do not feel that he can meet the need of the child he have be hire to serve due to the problem that the school be have in access the resource that it need from north yorkshire council my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan who can not be here today want to share the story of year old boy in her constituency who have life limit degenerative condition and be totally reliant on the care of other he have attend specialist school for many year but have be unable to attend since september because he have now move into education and his parent travel allowance to get he to and from school be cut by his parent be now unable to afford to transport he hear of set of twin in guildford one of whom be go through the local secondary school while their sibling have languish at home for year get little or no education the lack of contact with child their own age and of school routine be make the situation far bad imagine how devastating it be for the parent to see one child thrive while their twin suffer that can not be right in my constituency surgery just few week ago see parent whose year child be get handful of hour of medical tuition at sporadic time through the week which be logistical nightmare for the parent because the school that offer the alternative provision that they need and that be suitable for they simply do not have the space with the grow number of child who be be identify as have send there be insufficient provision and funding to keep pace in particular there be not enough space in our special school unfortunately the gap be often be fill by some who be just out to make money let be clear have no ideological issue with private send school many be brilliant not for profit charitable school deliver an excellent education but there be profiteer often by private equity company one company last year have turnover for send of million and million profit after tax far too many send school be make obscene profit while the sector struggle to provide basic education for so many that be put huge pressure on local authority budget as be some independent child home that be also run by private equity firm we already have local authority under the safety valve agreement with the dfe and we expect more to go on to that list we be be hold to ransom by people make money from those in need we be all ask for more money to be put in by central government but there be definitely case to be make that there be saving to be find by have more state fund specialist provision and give local authority the power to open special school when no other provider be come forth to set one up briefly on tribunal think everyone will know from their casework that local authority win only of appeal but spend over million fight they again that money could go into the system every child matter they deserve the very good be afraid that reform on send from the government have be very slow there have be delay after delay not help by the political chaos at the top of government even the late reform that be announce last year will not work without adequate funding congratulate and thank the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure the debate and shin spotlight on the issue hope that the minister will listen and look forward to his comment it be strike that there be such strong cross party support for the motion move by my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis congratulate he and agree with every word of his speech the minister be very smart man be sure that he will welcome the cross party pressure because he care lot about this subject and it will help he in his battle within the department and with the treasury for the much need increase in funding in this area suffolk be also member of the we be underfunde even compare with norfolk which can tell the house make we in suffolk feel particularly bad some of the local funding formula be still base on spending and because that be low in suffolk it be drag anchor while that drag anchor remain it be explicit in the formula that the funding be unfair between different county that need to be fix so that county such as suffolk get fair funding despite the very tight funding suffolk county council work incredibly hard there be some excellent example of good practice for instance at st mary in mildenhall exning primary school and other that have visit but they all suffer terribly from the very tight funding in addition to the point that have be make already across the party want to put slightly uncomfortable truth on the table have serve in the department and elsewhere in government think know bit about what be go on the challenge be that when ehcp be introduce in they improve the system by make statemente more consistent across the country but that do not resolve the fact that ultimately the budget be limited want the budget to be big but however big it be it will always be limit so it be also about how the budget be allocate thus far we have have discussion about how the budget be allocate between different county and region lead he be rather humble about it by my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker who be not only part of but be and have lead we have also discuss who individually get diagnosis and therefore who get an ehcp here there be big social injustice that need to be name and then deal with the silent scandal of access to diagnosis come at the issue from the point of view of dyslexia be dyslexic and it be the area that be most expert in until recently be vice president of the british dyslexia association study in november by the london school of economics find that of child with specific learn difficulty be in the most affluent decile and be in the least affluent that can not reflect reality it be simply not true that of those in the most affluent decile have specific learning difficulty and only in the most deprived the truth be this be just fact of life that in the most affluent decile be parent who can pay the for diagnosis outside the state system and more parent who be articulate and able to fight and go to their mp and to the council to make their case as my right hon friend the member for rossendale and darwen sir jake berry do for his child that mean that there be an unjust allocation of diagnosis within the system with relatively too much diagnosis among those in the upper echelon of the demographic scale and relatively too little for those who be less well off that be unfair ultimately that be an affront to universal education believe in universal education because it underpin universal equality of opportunity in this country however what lead to the disparity we see in the datum of who get diagnosis be if we say you can have universal education but if your child have special need you can pay to get they identify which will make it more likely they will get the ehcp and therefore much more state money follow they if you do have the or the wherewithal to find one of the many brilliant charity like evelyn that help you get it you will not get that extra money and therefore the extra support that be hard to fix than just ask for extra money because it imply that in one part of the income distribution too many people be get diagnosis that be the uncomfortable truth the fact be that there be not enough diagnosis early identification and funding but crucially there be also an inequality in the diagnosis that lead to the ehcp found charity the accessible learning foundation to try to champion that need for early identification and support that be how much care about the issue know the minister care about it as well and hope that he will address the point about the distribution of access and who get identify as well as the overall level of funding because both need to be fix also thank the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure the debate back in during the passage of the children and families act labour alongside multitude of teacher local authority professional organisation and parent warn the government that their rush reform would create postcode lottery of variable provision where many child with send would continue to be let down we warn that unless the propose reform be properly fund and proper demographic modelling be carry out to assess the actual number of child and learner who need support the reform would fail and fail they have even the government agree that the reform have fail state in as they launch review into send that they aim to improve the service available to family who need support and end the postcode lottery they still face after three year delay the government finally publish the review in highlight their own failure again that too often child and young people with send and those educate in alternative provision feel unsupported and their outcome fall behind those of their peer eventually in the government send and alternative provision improvement plan and road map be publish many have conclude that those be insufficient and ineffective give the crisis we face that view be share by my constituent who be absolutely exhausted from have to fight every single step of the way for their child education despite our local council send department come out of special measure in our child service be now rat inadequate despite hardworke council staff and dedicated teaching staff right across south shields the situation have not improve for many parent or child with send thank to continue cut assessment be grossly delay ehc plan be not be implement and child be travel mile out of our borough in the midst of cost of living crisis my constituent be pay for private assessment private tuition and independent school there be simply not enough specialist provision and not enough support in mainstream education costly appeal against ehc plan have rise to record high since the reform nearly last year yet have be successful so it be clear that there be something grossly wrong with the system that be likely only the tip of the iceberg because many parent do not have the time energy or financial support to continue legal action the parent have speak to say that they want to use their word in the debate but not their name for fear of any repercussion that just show how threatened they feel by the system as whole it be not just our child who be be short change for young adult with send access to further education be severely hamper by funding cut they deplete the sector which now survive largely on donation and fundraising as always with this government it be charity community interest company and other that have to fill the gap leave by the state for essential service without the north east autism society and autismable in south shields know that my constituent learn need would not be meet access to education should be fundamental right for all child no matter who they be where they be from or what their circumstance good education can mean the difference between where someone begin in life and where they end up people across the house may already know that struggle throughout my education with undiagnosed dyspraxia and dyslexia also do not come from wealthy or privileged background and be certainly not destine to end up in this place but get here through good education good teacher work experience and training education can make the impossible happen that be why my party goal always have be and always will be for educational excellence for every single child in this country thank my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for bring this important debate on send to the chamber before speak about send let say that some young people and child have be sit in the gallery in different group throughout the debate would like to say how incredibly proud be of our nation child and how incredibly proud they should be of themselves today our child rank in the world for math and for read do not know whether they be year but if they or any child watch today be in year can tell they that when they start school in reception they be in the world for math and for read it have be massive change fundamentally believe that every child should have the right to world class education because that education be what will give they the freedom to make choice about what they do with their future every child should have that choice and that be why special educational need child be so important we should ensure that they have those choice too no child should be leave behind they should have the right support opportunity and place the high need budget have double since so it be not fair to say that there have be funding cut it be not true but there have also be significant growth in demand as child minister during the pandemic know that the toll the pandemic take on child not just in this country but globally break my heart we know that it take big toll on those child who be already know to have send but it also mean that more child present today with special educational need than in the past part of that be to do with the early year which be so crucial to child development particularly their communication and education skill very young child miss out on those crucial three year when visit primary school in my chelmsford constituency last term be tell that of the child in their reception class be not properly toilet train that be massive change other primary school have tell that they see more reception and year child present as somewhere on the autistic spectrum as well as with some adhd need but because they be not assess early or give more support in the early year environment they have arrive at school without support that could have help they cope more easily with mainstream school have be work with essex county council and some of my school to see what we can do about that there be clearly backlog in assess child could we for example encourage or do more with educational psychologist to see whether they could see more child we know we have shortage of educational psychologist and they be in great demand but could they be see more child in the time they have be sure we could do more with specialist hub within mainstream school which be key where they work they work really well anecdotally be concern about the rise in child be put on part time timetable especially those who may not yet have an ehcp part time timetable should only be use for very short time wonder whether there be some systemic social issue that be impact on young people mental health in particular some have point out to suggest link between an increase in online gaming poor mental health and attendance at school want to mention school attendance because it have be in the press lot this week with the new statistic show that the proportion of student that be persistently absent from school have more than double as colleague have point out where child have unmet send need that can lead to they miss school because they face issue with attendance there can be good reason why child with send sometimes have high rate of non attendance than other but we need to make sure that their need be meet that be not new issue this week however the department for education have focus on it and produce new guidance work together to improve school attendance the select committee also produce detailed report the no recommendation of which be that that guidance should be make statutory before christmas present private member bill to the house the school attendance duty of local authorities and proprietors of schools bill which will do two thing it will make that guidance statutory and it will require local authority to support family school and child with their attendance within that guidance there be the understanding that child with special educational need need bespoke support and that that support need to be carrot not just stick and fine hope that every single member of this house will get behind my private member bill as one of the thing we should be do to support child with their attendance include make sure that more child with send get the support they need thank the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure this important debate declare an interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group for special educational need and disability everyone be very welcome to get involve in that and as one of the few openly neurodiverse mps have dyspraxia dyslexia and adhd across the sector it be truism that send provision in the uk be chronically underfunde other have already allude to the estimate of billion while additional fund deliver through the deliver well value programme and the additional billion on capital funding be welcome it be clear that they just do not meet the fund need to stand still let alone the additional demand for service which be grow every year fix the investment gap be critical to address the issue but want to make plea that we can not see this as simply number problem we have see that approach recently from ministers for example with the revelation report in the observer last october of target to cut ehcp by in contract to develop the deliver well value programme it be not just about the target it be about the method of get there through early intervention and through make our education system more inclusive however we should also be clear about the reality that although hard fought and hard win in heavily under resource system an ehcp be lifeline for young people and family in advocate for the provision they need for many send family the target will be source of alarm behind those number be family and young people who be struggle the measure of policy be not fall statistic or the amount of money it save but the extent to which it address the need of young people try to access the education that be their right strongly believe that our approach to the issue should start with treat send young people and their family with the dignity and respect that all people deserve that should mean support hand from day one but we lack the infrastructure for that kind of early intervention survey last year by the institute of health visiting find that only of health visitor in england feel that they be deliver good or outstanding service that be too low only be work within the recommend ratio of child per visitor and more than quarter of the workforce be service the need of child that be terrible statistic the institute estimate shortfall of health visitor in england and say they will leave the profession in the next five year we have also see dramatic cut in sure start service with centre closure since the onset of austerity in as an aside the scale of those closure throw yesterday inadequate announcement of new family hub into stark relief as have be say early identification of send also require have train early year staff who know what they be look for to most people that seem like common sense recent survey by the fair foundation find that people overestimate early year pay by people value this workforce but their pay do not value they nearly three quarter of the survey participant think that people work in early year should be pay more and agree we need to invest in the workforce charge with look after our child and properly value the work they do as well as training and upskille they where necessary on all these point of early intervention the crisis in the health visitor workforce cut to sure start and the undervaluing of early year staff the lack of multi sensory teaching workforce and speech and language therapist and the difficulty access physio we be move in the wrong direction we need more healthcare visitor with visit on day one of child life we need more early year support for family and young people and we need professionalise early year workforce that know how to identify the send need of our child those problem be systemic they be also about how service integrate it be no good identify need if there be not enough capacity to give timely referral in march the waiting list for speech and language therapy have go up by since from to and no wonder last year the royal college of speech and language therapists find that almost one in four job be vacant across the uk if we take adhd we know that the referral rate be go up and there be some shocking statistic of people wait up to three year for referral the wait be up to decade in some adult service we need to cut down the waiting time for all form of assessment and diagnosis to do that will require look at those backlog as we would any other backlog and take seriously the staffing shortage we be suffer we should be promote strength base approach to send in the education system we should be look to create inclusive space where young people can truly be themselves there be no good reason why child with send should not flourish but that mean rethink how we approach behaviour in classroom training and support teacher to understand that all behaviour be form of communication not off roll young people because they do not fit into certain box or just to cheat the figure will finish with the point that ofsted should not be rat any school excellent if it do not have good quality send provision be grateful for the opportunity to speak in this very important debate and to my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure it hope that can contribute with some experience as the leader of local authority and as someone who sit on the education committee send inquiry in want to describe the problem from local authority perspective for colleague in the house the legislation be well intentione as we have hear but it have not deliver on those intention in some way it have create an impossible circumstance where very high level of demand and expectation now exist on service that face huge budget and capacity pressure that be not sustainable local authority in many way be catch between rock and hard place they be expect to meet the demand of family but also have to balance budget and all the time with the knowledge that any step take to reduce cost may well end up be overturn in tribunal inadvertently and understandably seek to give parent of send child some authority and control over what support they get be create an adversarial system there be fund issue to all that but fundamentally the system do not work so funding alone will not fix it because it be partnership across health school local authority and other there be challenge both in meeting expectation and in accountability for the outcome fundamentally at policy level we have system that say to family that they can have whatever support and service they want that be laudable aim but in reality there be limited budget and capacity in the system which mean that local authority and delivery partner be constrain in what they can do the system have not recognise that contradiction so the local partnership be still judge against an unachievable target which be why in the late inspection nowhere nationally be any well than inconsistent in its send outcome in nottinghamshire we fully recognise the need for improvement in the capacity for send support in tackle wait time for outcome and in the scrutiny and accountability of the system among other thing we have introduce new send improvement board dame christine lenehan of the council for disabled children it its independent chair with the intention of drive improvement in the system with proper scrutiny and oversight we have already see positive step from it we be fully commit to tackle those issue to the extent that have also create specific cabinet role for send support in truth though we be constrain the inspection regime be not really sure of what it be ask we for many authority have huge deficit in the high need block so they be massively overspending yet they have still receive more positive inspection outcome we have balance the budget and do not have deficit which clearly have an impact on service but that do not seem to be factor in inspection outcome be we be ask to balance that budget or not we have legal duty to do so but it be not recognise by ofsted nottinghamshire be among the most poorly fund authority in this space but we still balance our budget for additional need other authority have more money and still overspend massively but be reward with well inspection outcome fundamentally the system do not have shared and coherent view of what it be ask we to deliver that be huge issue we be also tell that the government approach be to increase inclusion in mainstream school where possible it be absolutely right for child to receive appropriate support in mainstream set wherever possible and for we to work with school and senco to deliver it notts have take that approach for many year and be hold up as an exemplar of good practice in some government circle but at inspection we be mark down for it again different part of government be tell we different thing so it be not always clear what we be be ask to do we take graduated approach and step child up the pyramid depend on need but the first response be to try to support child to remain in mainstream school partly because that be very often the good outcome for the child and partly because it be requirement of system with limited funding that we try low cost option first from an outcome perspective that be often the right thing to do because although some child will require lifelong care we want many of they to go on and live independent life and be in employment we should have high ambition for our child it be not often the good thing to become more reliant on more service than we need because it can make that journey to be an independent adult more difficult every child and every circumstance be different but from what be say member can see where the tension and conflict arise at each stage the opinion of health professional and people task with achieve the goal of help child to become independent adult often clash with the totally understandable desire of parent to get the most and very good bespoke support for their child send transport be one of the big pressure on council budget at the minute our budget have rise by over five year because of rise demand inflationary cost of fuel and contract and wage rise so we be again in position of try to save money in some case that be the right thing to do because the expectation outstrip what be reasonable however it will inevitably lead we to further conflict as we have to go back to family and say know you ve have one to one taxi service to school with supportive member of staff every day for the past several year but we now need you to share with somebody else or we now need you to take your child to school yourself because you have mobility vehicle for that purpose that might be the right thing to do these might be rational decision in order to offer the good service within limited budget but it will inevitably cause issue that be come down the track if we end up with such decision be overturn in tribunal we be back to the question of what we be be ask to achieve within our limited budget on bright note want to mention some of the work that we be do in nottinghamshire we be take this incredibly seriously through our independent improvement board and cabinet level focus as have mention we be create send specialist place include at the newark orchard send school which open last year and at new school that we be build in mansfield this year be very proud of that we be work with senco in our school to improve the graduated approach and the available support money be not the ultimate answer here we have well mean legislation that do not work ask ministers to consider two proposal first the help with send transport cost order and the other will come back to thank you call rachael maskell such be the need in york that have undertake comprehensive project on send at recent constituency send summit of parent agency and charity all be desperate to see child have their care need meet to put it into context york be the bad area for school funding and it be in the bottom third for high need funding child in york deserve the same as child across the country there should be no differentiation recently meet york hospital paediatric team they highlight the change that they be see in they assess child for autism by that figure have rise to and last year it rise again the story be that funding be not rise with the need that those child have the same be occur for education health and care plan we need those rise to be meet with increase funding for the workforce health visitor physio psychologist and speech and language therapist and for special school place and mental health service we need comprehensive multi agency workforce plan that be my first ask of the minister secondly we know that early investment save money over lifetime we should see that not as spending but as investment in young life we need to ensure that child with physical impairment have the equipment they need so that they be not wait forever for wheelchair for example but get it on spec and on time one of my constituent have now be place in residential care halfway across the country because they need an accessible shower in their home as read this week say goodbye bring tear to both parent eye goodness know the long term cost we need to smarten up when it come to child with need this be not just about health or local authority funding it be also about education have see the travail of teach assistant in york who have be strip of week contract and give term time only contract they be juggle at least two job just to survive on the low pay scale imaginable every day they teach nurse and support emotional physical and mental health need with high degree of skill we need proper job evaluation scheme and national pay spine for teach assistant they need recognition and wage that reflect it as we have hear this week we also need to consider exclude child we know from the datum that autistic child be almost twice as likely to be exclude with or without plan which come at heavy cost the disciplinary process at south bank multi academy trust in my constituency about which be meet the minister shortly be turn away child with send at such high rate child there be melt down at home because they be not get the support they need my third ask of the minister be that when he leave the chamber he go to the department rip up the draconian guidance on discipline and start again by institute therapeutic school fourthly we need to have look at the shortage of childcare and special support after school during holiday and out of school thank york inspirational kids snappy the island and so many more for the provision that they offer but their funding be also challenge we need to ensure that they get the resource that they need to provide support for child outside school for far too long parent have battle they be battle they be fight and they be exhausted because they be not get support they wait for month and year to get the diagnosis that be key to unlock everything we need to ensure that parent who be wait for diagnosis get the advice and help that they need to well support their child in those early year what difference that could make for they thank all those who work in send in my constituency know how desperate they be they be stress and stretch because they be try to deliver far more than their time allow we value every penny spend in their direction but we need to look again at the funding formula which be simply not work and ensure that we see it as an opportunity for the future invest in these child ensure that they have the opportunity they need finally we need complete overhaul of the sen improvement plan it need to be far more evidence base base on the datum as well as the good therapy possible we need to look around the globe at where they get thing right first time and ensure that our child get that benefit too ensure that service be properly fund will make such difference to these young people it will give they the opportunity in life that they be currently be deny it will help to heal the relationship between child and parent which be often so stressed as they struggle to get by week by week and it be the right thing to do thank all school staff for the amazing work that they do day in and day out see that at first hand as school governor for year during my time as an mp and be in awe of what teacher and school support staff do they have massively improve the performance of child in england in reading and math we have shoot up the international league table and the first place to start be by give big thank you to school for what they have do have see the work that our dedicated teacher do for child with special need and disability in heathwood lower school and many other school and have also spend time with voluntary group such as freddie friends in leighton buzzard which set out to provide safe and welcome place for child with special need and disability hope that the fact that time out of school be equally important for these child do not get lose in the debate like other local authority central bedfordshire council benefit from recent increase in funding for special educational need and disability which be very welcome despite that the council have have to vote furth million of additional funding to balance the book on the issue of fairness have look at the dsg funding figure for central bedfordshire and for hampshire which be statistical neighbour of central bedfordshire hampshire get per child while central bedfordshire get difference of if that high figure be good enough for child in hampshire it be good enough for the child be proud to represent notwithstanding the massive investment on the part of the government and the extra money put in by central bedfordshire council central bedfordshire manage to complete only around one in five of its education health and care plan application within the statutory timeframe and number of child with ehcp be still without school wonder what the government do to monitor and enforce local authority statutory duty there be wide problem at play in get child in my constituency the support that they need many probably majority of the child who go on to need an education health and care plan need to see specialist doctor at our local child development centre the edwin lobo centre the waiting list for that centre which serve my constituent currently stand at between and week once the appointment have take place there be often delay of further four to five week before the doctor report be receive all that take place before the week clock start tick and in four out of five case it will be miss anyway that mean that child be routinely wait more than two year in either an inappropriate setting or school where there be insufficient funding to properly meet their need for many young child that can represent very large proportion of their school life and lead to they miss out on those vital first few year it be clear to that what be need be what we try to get back in more join up approach to special educational need and disability by the secretary of state for education and the secretary of state for health and social care to look at this issue in the round when the minister respond to the debate would be grateful if he could address my point about the difference in local authority funding the wait in the health system and what we can do to bridge the gap and get the care that these child need to be provide on timely basis all member present have experience of their own constituency be the chair of governor of specialist school like the right hon member for rossendale and darwen sir jake berry bring together local organisation and parent over time declare an interest my wife dr cynthia pinto be an educational psychologist she chair the british psychological society education and child psychology division which be in conference at the moment will circulate couple of page from briefing that have be send to that contain some of the discussion that be take place at that conference all the experience we be report in this house be very similar we have come across some wonderful young people who have achieve so much despite the disadvantage they have have and some incredibly dedicated staff true professional do the good they can but also large number of tragedy relate to the struggle those young people face particularly to get the assessment and support they need member may remember that last september report be release regard the increase in the number of complaint from parent to the local government ombudsman there be increase in the number of complaint uphold by the ombudsman from parent who be fail to get access to the service they desperately need as the right hon member for rossendale and darwen say most of those complaint be about access to the assessment to get the plan itself in place do not want to repeat what have be say before but be afraid this do come down to money it be about finance as we have hear from other member people have fail to get access from the very early stage and if my constituency be anything like other the closure of the sure start centre have have an impact the development of family hub may be bit of solution but as the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis outline at the very beginning as always congratulate he on secure this debate the gap in overall local government expenditure be huge and it be cumulative over number of year welcome the additional money that the government have provide in recent year but the lack of investment have build up over long time the group figure be incontestable and that lack of investment be report right across the country the motion we be debate call for review of send funding be interested to hear from the minister how that review will take place if the house pass the motion because it be urgently need to turn back to the issue of educational psychologist want to cite the government own stat the educational psychologist route into the plan be so key to ensure that parent have confidence that there be something they can build on at least and they use those plan effectively in their negotiation with their local authority to get the resource they need as the right hon member for west suffolk matt hancock say due to the lack of access to local authority educational psychologist too many parent be have to raise the fund themselves to bring in private educational psychologist which of course then advantage they over other the figure that the department for education have publish regard educational psychologist recruitment state that of local authority be report difficulty in recruitment be cite pay as reason one third be report difficulty with the retention of educational psychologist and be not confident that they will be able to meet the demand for educational psychologist service staggering of local authority that report recruitment and retention issue say that those difficulty affect outcome for child and young people require support the inability to get plan as result of the long waiting time for educational psychologist assessment be almost the foundation stone of the current failure of the system have to say that the recent pay deal have not help at all this year for the first time in its history the association of educational psychologists take industrial action because it be desperate on the issue of pay it have just have settlement which it have reluctantly accept but the argument come back from the association be that it do not think the settlement will do anything for retention or future recruitment that have to be look at and it will undoubtedly come back as an issue not hope as an issue for industrial action but as an issue for proper negotiation how be the minister go to respond to all the issue we have raise today we will agree that there should be review unfortunately the review that take place and the plan put forward by the government have not work and have not embed confidence in the mind of other would therefore welcome the minister view on how such review should take place also say to those on my own front bench that this issue have to be address when we go into government hope in the come month and that will require resource it be pleasure to take part in this very important debate and congratulate my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis on secure it have two special need school in my constituency alderman knight school should declare that my wife be governor of it and the milestone school they provide the most amazing care and education for child with special need specifically milestone provide for child with far more complex need while alderman knight provide for those with range of difficulty one of the problem we have in gloucestershire as have be say about other area be lack of special school place estimate put that figure at about place short across the county the problem be that because they have be give place on appeal child have have special school place award to they but no place have yet be find for they that be very big difficulty that both the school mention have raise with alderman knight be build year ago for pupil and there be now pupil on its roll that put big strain on the school itself and it also mean that class size have increase the problem with that for special school be that as the class size get big they tend to lose what make they special which be something they be very concerned about such school be obviously very concerned about their budget as have be say the formula for calculate the cost of educate child in special school be outdate and do not work especially when child require one to one situation it simply do not enable the school to provide that kind of care the problem be that even if they could find extra teacher and even if they could recruit they they could not actually afford to do so because of their budget all this mean that the school be under great strain but it also mean that as place be not find for some pupil who should be educate in special need school they end up in mainstream school it have always be the case that an awful lot of pupil with special need be educate in mainstream school which have cop magnificently for very many year with many of those pupil but some of those pupil should actually be in special school not mainstream school and such school tend to struggle to provide the kind of care and education that their pupil need they also have problem with funding because the formula they depend on be outdate and not accurate so they have similar problem we have big and grow problem as mention by right hon and hon member we have problem with the overall funding formula gloucestershire have traditionally be lower funded do not know why and no minister in any government have ever be able to persuade of the reason for that or the need to continue with such situation be aware that few year ago because of pressure from and many of we in this chamber the formula be improve but by no means have it be improve to the extent that it need to be improve be not necessarily ask for more money from the treasury be ask for the cake to be slice up in much fair way and for the formula for calculate how much be need to educate child with special need to be reassess and change think that each county or metropolitan area however it be divide up need to carry out full assessment of how many child have special need and require place in special school and against that they need to assess how many place be available if there be shortfall the government must come forward with proposal for how that will be put right we certainly need to assess how much it be cost mainstream school to educate child with special need and whether they be get enough money it be my submission that they be not so we need to decide what we will to do about that be not go to speak about ehcp because that issue have be cover by several hon member the only thing would add be that it be not only the time it take to get the plan that be the problem the plan also need to be reassess as the child progress through school quite often that take far too long so the child do not get the care they need and they do not then get the money follow those new assessment there be lot of issue but only have very short time so want to finish by pay tribute to the special school not only in my constituency but across gloucestershire we have something of battle many year ago to save special school provision in gloucestershire and be glad we do because such school carry out the most fantastic work however we do need to reassess the situation and we need to make sure that those school can carry on serve what be very special child rise order it will be obvious to the house that many people still wish to speak after the next speaker will have to reduce the time limit to five minute the next speaker with six minute be ruth cadbury fantastic thank you madam deputy speaker congratulate the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis on secure the debate we have hear many excellent speech from across the house although notice that there be demand for more funding from member whose party have be responsible for these budget for the past year every time visit school in my constituency and discuss my role and the child aspiration with they go on to meet the head or senior leadership team and without exception the first and most pressing issue they raise with be send they tell they do not have the resource to adequately support these child or their parent they feel that these child be be abandon that be not for want of adequate legal power with the ehcp system bring in in or due to the support structure of hounslow council but because of chronic lack of resource to deliver what the law expect head also tell that there seem to have be recent rise in the number of child who clearly have additional need with child exhibit extreme stress which be hardly surprising give the housing and income pressure that many local family face grow number of child also appear to be present with some form of neurodiversity most teacher be not specialist in mental health neurodiversity or other form of send however school feel that they can not teach child or indeed the other child in the class if five child in class can not sit down can not stop talk or be even scream rip thing up chew thing or as hear about one child spend hour on end switch particular light switch on and off on and off these child be not naughty the experienced educationalist tell this know that with appropriate and adequate specialist support these child can and would learn they can thrive and they can achieve but the school just do not have the resource to provide the world class education that all child need treat send as serious policy priority be important not just for child with additional need but for their parent and sibling their teacher and the other child in their school but under this government these people be not get the support they need they be be let down and child future be be fail in the government extend the send duty of local council to include young people up to the age of and add social and healthcare need to what be previously statement just of educational need yet there be no additional funding for the additional legal requirement despite this government undermine local authority role in school management and governance local authority be still expect to provide appropriate send provision they can not do that when there be sweeping cut to their budget hounslow council have face budget cut of over million since and the cut have have huge negative impact on local send support in the borough countless local parent have tell they be have to wait far too long for their child ehcp and when the plan be issue there be huge flaw and not enough support threshold for support rise as funding decline one indicator of the scale of such problem be that nationally there be appeal to tribunal in an increase of in the last year and of the case be resolve in favour of the parent and child often the appeal mark the first time parent feel they have be listen to but as the right hon member for west suffolk matt hancock say the tribunal system only help parent who have the ability and the resource to push through the jungle many of our constituent would not know where to start no parent should have to fight for an appropriate education for their child what about the specialist resource take up by the assessment and the tribunal that should be spend on provide appropriate education and support for these child appropriate training for their teacher and appropriate support for their parent which together will enable the child to thrive the briefing we receive from the national autistic society highlight the inefficient spending of what fund there be in the system although as say funding be insufficient the hurdle in front of parent before during and after the process of appeal be immense that be the central message receive when visit and meet the hounslow parent carers forum and hear about the problem they face the shortage of resource mean that there be lack of training for teach assistant for one to one support lack of transport and lack of specialist therapeutic support and for many child it even mean the lack of school place child with high need be stick at home with parent who can not go out to work because there be no special school place for they more family with one or more child with additional need be also face housing stress have constituent with very disturbed child who be always try to jump out of tower block window the government have take many positive step include double high need funding since but increase demand for send support together with change to the code of practice in and then the covid pandemic have exacerbate the challenge congratulate my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis on bring this debate to the house will talk about early year and early intervention there have never be more funding pour into early year and childcare provision than there be now but that be extend the provision of the free entitlement early intervention be crucial and it require skilled staff who can spot special educational need or gap and coherent strategy align with funding policy to deliver early intervention and early support effectively send policy and more funding for it need to be bring into early year we need more focus on high quality provision for those who need it the most that will require significant funding initially but it will save billion in the long term know the government take seriously their plan to deliver long term change for bright future for everyone in the uk we need to invest to save will focus on hastings and rye and east sussex county council where the need for send support be daily issue in my inbox call for more alternative provision in hastings and st leonards and the head of the three secondary school in the area be unite with in this call high quality alternative provision be desperately need to meet the need of the leave behind child no child should ever be leave behind we now have huge number of child with send it be not sustainable for school and east sussex county council to meet the high need of those child with the current model every child deserve to have their need meet so they can flourish and be useful member of our society the implementation of the children and families act place significant new and unfunded burden on local authority there have be an exponential increase in the number of child be identify as have significant send need many to the extent that it be feel that they can not be provide for in their local mainstream school only this week receive letter from the conservative leader of east sussex county council regard the council financial situation although inflation have fall it have have permanent impact on budget as some significant cost have rise at high rate than the quote inflation rate at the same time demand for statutory service particularly child social care home to school transport and adult social care continue to rise at an exponential rate for example the number of child in care whose placement cost more than week have rise with the single costly one currently week or million annually east sussex county council be member of we need fair funding formula which should have cross party agreement so that there be no change in the come year for local authority that reflect local need alison jeffery the excellent and experienced director of east sussex child service which be rat outstanding by ofsted have give east sussex mps comprehensive briefing for today debate in which she outline the challenge but also suggest sensible solution have send the minister the full briefing paper by email for his consideration and discussion and hope he will meet to do that ms jeffery state that while she and east sussex child service always want more investment the policy and legal framework for send be of equal importance the send green paper identify range of factor some of which be be test through the send and ap change programme which have significant challenge many of the thing be test be not main driver of either demand or cost more importantly no legislative change be be make as part of the programme the thing that do drive demand be not be address for example we need to review urgently the threshold for full send need assessment one option be to give mainstream school the resource autonomy and responsibility to support pupil with send short of an ehcp without label they as such that would allow readjustment of the threshold for access an ehcp so it would be meet only when it be evident that provision in mainstream setting be either not possible or possible only with specify extraordinary support there be other challenge and solution and hope the minister will meet to discuss they congratulate and thank the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis constituency neighbour of mine for secure this debate on such an important subject he be quite right to point out that the resource available for child with additional need in our part of yorkshire be under immense strain and look forward to work with he on cross party basis to improve provision for those in our area who desperately need it he paint bleak picture of send provision nationally with local authority high need funding deficit predict to reach billion by march it be clear that we be fail in term of both the quality and the quantity of provision across the country it be important that we think about the life of the people come across every day who be wrap up in this failure the child prevent from realise their full potential by system that work against they the parent trap in seemingly endless cycle of push disjoint agency and authority often trap in their home with little respite and finally the overworked and under resource service provider who be force to paper over the crack of broken system system that appear to be fail everyone in my local area who try their good to engage with it in difficult circumstance those who operate our service be nobly try to do more with less to meet the need of grow number of child with additional need but meet this growth in demand be simply not possible without increase resource refuse to recognise the resource crisis in this sector be an unparalleled false economy and insufficient emphasis on intervention at the early year foundation stage store up huge cost pressure far down the line that be evident in the nationwide datum on this issue across the country the number of child with sen who be either exclude or wait for school place have rise by in the past three year that be the consequence of not face up to the challenge of proper funding and refuse to take the hard choice to do the right thing to provide sufficient support for these child and their family the national figure be compound by the particularity of the area represent in selby and ainsty our rurality as the right hon gentleman mention our poor public transport infrastructure and the wealth inequality that we see across our constituency create challenge of provision that be hard to crack on public policy level but also make the experience of live without provision more isolate and overwhelming for the parent and child affect in the selby district send provision be not just in rut it be truly in freefall as say in my maiden speech parent have to suffer through the uncertainty of send their child to travel in taxi for hour day to attend school in scarborough or harrogate those child be often exhausted and stress non verbal autistic child be unable to communicate the sheer scale of the stress that such journey create for they any reasonable person in my constituency can see that the situation can not continue be glad that the department for education have engage constructively with on this subject thank the minister personally for his effort to do so but would like to push little far on few specific point that have raise previously first though concede that the phase in period for selby send school must be well manage press the dfe to make every effort possible to explore effort for temporary accommodation uplift in the intervene year before the school be open and to ensure that these temporary place be extend to many local child as quickly as possible be sure that the minister can understand the frustration of local parent who have already be wait half decade for the school to open in the first year only student will be accommodate in the second year it will be and the school will only reach its full complement the year after that mean that by the time it reach full capacity it will have be almost decade since funding be first allocate by the dfe maintain option for temporary accommodation throughout this process will be crucial remain resolute in my conviction that every child in the selby district regardless of their need have the right to world class education in well fund british school will keep fight to make that reality and once again thank the minister for his engagement and the right hon member for haltemprice and howden for secure this crucial debate every child be special and deserve the good possible start in life that be why be passionate advocate for send like many in this place wish have magic wand to resolve all the issue that have be discuss this afternoon but do not resolution require dedication vision hard work and above all lot of money as the mp for bracknell it would be easy for to knock labour run bracknell forest council for what it be and be not do but that be not my style be team player and those who know will realise that the good politician be those who work cross party to resolve issue of great importance as send be to everyone in bracknell forest there be also work to do locally and will continue to do my bit in westminster nationally be comfortable right now that the government be move in the right direction on the offer for those with send the headline be that the department for education be invest billion between and to support local authority to offer new place and improve exist provision for child and young people with send that be reinforce by the send review publish in march the headline there be that spending have increase by more than from to billion overall by next year which be lot of money the send paper review number of key challenge particularly the difficulty that parent have in navigate the send system have meet many family locally and the story have move to tear in some case there be difficulty of access to provision child not in school and place not available it be difficult thing to have to deal with as an mp and do my good as we all do outcome for child with send be not comparable with their peer despite the continue and unprecedented investment the system be not financially sustainable what be be do we have an extra billion for the high need provision capital allocation in june the department announce that it would build up to new centrally deliver special need school one of those will be in my constituency in crowthorne and be pleased to have play small part in secure the funding for that but let we be more ambitious and go for third we have kennel lane and the new school in crowthorne and let we go for third because there be demand for those place urge bracknell forest council to be more ambitious in what it seek from the government recognise that the high need budget have rise by more than over three year and the department be continue to work with local authority with the high dedicated school grant deficit as part of the safety valve programme recognise that this be of great difficulty for school locally bracknell forest have the safety valve programme recognise the impact that it be have and it may be the good option in the short term overall more money than ever be be invest in school right now ensure that every child get class education the total budget of billion in be an increase over previous year and the high per capita funding ever that be also the same for send funding but it be still not enough will raise two quick issue with the minister the first be that mental health service need shot in the arm we have million in child mental health in bracknell but camhs be disaster and it need volt put straight through it it be not right that family be wait two year or more for consultation it be immoral and inept the irony will not be lose on the minister that gp can not prescribe medication for any neurodiverse condition without diagnosis from camhs there be vicious cycle whereby we can not get diagnosis we can not resource ehcp we can not place child in setting and we can not even give the parent and the kid themselves some solace without diagnosis from camhs would like every local authority in the uk to comprehensively review its send provision so that it become available in every area for every child specialist setting be the way forward for those who need they and every local authority should have those specialist setting under their wing we need to invest in our child with send as never before yes there be more to do and yes more money be need lot of it but we also need to make well use of what we have we need to be efficient and able locally to give the kid what they need devon be in the middle of special educational need pandemic unrelated to the pandemic teach briefly before be elect to this place and be shock by the number of child with special educational need have entire class where every single child have special educational need newly qualified teacher simply can not do anything beyond what more experienced colleague advise which be to treat every child as special as indeed they be start by pay tribute to all the parent teacher and student who be battle the system to get what they believe be right for their child back home in north devon recognise those frustration and my inbox be full of those concern but my word today be not about individual case when look at this issue we need to aggregate to try to well understand what be happen in devon we seem to have far too many child be give label rather than the help they need to fulfil their potential an excellent report by the south west social mobility commission find that the south west have the few child from disadvantaged background reach the expect level in reading writing and math at age of any region at just compare with in london the region also have the few young people from any background go on to level or above education or training progression rate among those from disadvantaged background be just in the south west compare with in london within those statistic devon be an enormous education authority on average it clearly do not look too great from these figure but even that hide the variance of what be go on in the northern part of the county where our social mobility be significantly bad than the south devon be diagnose send and give out ehcp at twice the rate of our neighbouring council in devon the number of child and young people with an echp have grow from in to in increase family in devon pursue an ehcp as they know that will gain they well support than be without one but it be no wonder that budget be under pressure give this explosion would like to see far more work be do to understand why that be the case how we can reduce it and how we can raise the educational attainment and social mobility of our young people rather than increase the number of label they carry the situation in devon have go on for year we now have cohort of young people leave school with few qualification special educational need and limited support to move forward the situation be so severe that recently arrive academy trust have have to adapt its normal process because of the level of sen and the high number of pupil unable to cope with its discipline regime whatever the right and wrong of that regime that thing be so different in northern devon from elsewhere in the country do ring alarm bell that be particularly because be so sparsely populated it be not like city where child can switch to another school if something go really badly wrong at school my school have some of the big catchment in the country and if child and their parent feel that they would be well serve outside their exist school that result in child be home educate for some family that be ideal for many it be not have be the home education for child while teach do not believe that the one hour week that provide replace school education no one seem to be able to track fully where these child be how many have opt out of school or be off roll and what provision they be receive for those who have particularly complex need and require special education we currently have application for every place child be travel halfway across the county to get to school ninety minute in car be no way to start the day it also mean that any friendship be unlikely to extend beyond school and the cost involve be astronomical devon sen transport cost have rise from million to million increase there be clearly an argument that devon need more funding as we receive an average of head compare to the national average of rank out of local authority we budget far too much funding at per capita for independent specialist provider double the english average and in we budget large per capita spend against that backdrop warmly welcome the government work and their commitment to work with devon county council to tackle that with the minister engagement and that of his predecessor warmly welcome the commitment to build new special school in devon however the delay on two of they be put further pressure on council budget the arrival of the new proactive chief executive at devon county council with her experience of deliver in rural area do give hope for the future but the rate of growth in sen be not sustainable rural per pupil funding particularly for transport do need address and we need well sustainable early year support and intervention so that pupil can avoid the need to apply for an ehcp hope that the minister will be able to find time to meet and devon colleague to discuss the challenge that our constituent and council be face the conservatives record in education over the last year have be very good from phonic and academy to free school and the recent news that the total core school budget will be at its high ever level in the next financial year billion there be much to be proud of however the story be not universally good when visit school in my gedle constituency always ask the headteacher at the end of my visit if could wave magic wand and solve one thing for you what would it be the almost unanimous response specifically of primary head be about improve send provision therefore congratulate my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis and the backbench business committee for make this important debate possible welcome the news that between and there will be an extra billion to support local authority to deliver new place and improve exist provision for child with sen the group which we have hear much about have produce information show the high need block funding per pupil allocation by local authority which show that westminster and camden be at the top of the table camden get more than per pupil but nottinghamshire be fourth from bottom at about now appreciate that there can be various regional factor london weighting and so forth but in nottinghamshire have receive million less in funding compare with worcestershire and million less than warwickshire so although acknowledge the significant uplift in funding in the last four year nottinghamshire still have the poor funding per head compare to neighbour nottinghamshire see an increase in education health and care plan of just over in and just over in in line with the national annual increase of but the low funding level increase pressure on mainstream setting to meet the need of child with complex special educational need and disability and the pressure on school budget combine with the increase in level of complex need mean that school be struggle to fund the notional send allocation per child require before they request additional top up funding we hear early from the leader of nottinghamshire county council my hon friend the member for mansfield ben bradley applaud his work at the county council to increase high quality special school and alternative provision place he outline that there be plan in place or in development for place but with recent capacity survey suggest that will be require by september there be still the risk of shortfall my hon friend raise the subject of sen transport which be significant issue in nottinghamshire it be reasonably large county and sen transport expenditure have increase significantly from million in to over million by that cost increase have be drive by increase pupil number require specialist provision lack of local specialist provision so travel be require increase journey time and significant inflationary pressure with fuel cost increase by in the last month and wage by all that have mean that the average retendere contract for sen transport have increase by between and therefore although welcome the fact that the government have meet their inflation target they have halve inflation over the last year and inflation be come down those cost pressure obviously remain will also highlight the time that it can take to process funding application nottinghamshire have lot of stand alone infant school go to one myself pinewood infant school in arnold in my gedle constituency and one issue that can be face be that by the time the funding have come through the child have already leave the infant school nottinghamshire county council be do much work to streamline funding for child in the transition from nursery set to school with particular focus on stand alone infant school but would welcome further work by the dfe to help make that process well the group be campaign for equitable funding for all school to deliver high quality education appreciate that some of its ask be big and with billion of pound require that will not be resolve overnight but do ask whether the process can be streamline and make quick so that we get the money to where it be need there be also serious work to be do to address the regional variation that mean that area such as nottinghamshire have be leave out do not intend this to be critical speech as say at the outset the conservatives have good story to tell from the right support right time right place command paper to the doubling of high need funding since and investment in new special school but there be more work to be do on level up in this area thank my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis for secure this important debate for many year we have recognise the importance of universal education for all child and young adult back in school attendance be make compulsory for child age between five and in parliament extend the principle of compulsory education to blind and deaf child establish the first specialised school similar provision would be make for physically impair child by the end of that century why do that matter we as nation recognise and champion the idea of universal education this house recognise that principle back in the late but it be not until that the local education authority be give the responsibility to identify child with physical and non physical disability what we call today special educational need and ensure that child be provide with education right the way through to the age of today we can not guarantee universal education for every child or at least not at the level to properly help child grow and learn nowhere be that more the case than for child and young adult with special educational need or disability across england million pupil have diverse range of educational need and not every one of they be get the education they need or deserve the government have acknowledge that and vow to tackle it which welcome and will continue to work with the government on that when unveil the send review in the then secretary of state for education admit that while prior reform such as those in give critical support to more family the reality be that the system be not work as many member have mention this afternoon parent email constantly and visit at surgery ask and plead with to help they secure adequate provision for their child care deeply about this which be why have make it one of my priority as the member of parliament for uxbridge and south ruislip as serve councillor in hillingdon be all too aware of the work that hillingdon council have to do to provide suitable send provision to those child and young adult who need it despite the challenge in hillingdon the child service team have recently be award outstanding by ofsted what be more have be lucky to see the work be do when visit local school through charity visit have be able to hear more about what they be do to help child and young adult with special educational need be proud to say that that include the seeability programme at moorcroft school in uxbridge seeability be an amazing organisation that work to ensure that child with disability do not miss out on eyecare and play part in champion the government national scheme to bring eyecare to all special school that work by the council charity and other organisation be be undo by incredible strain financial strain especially as many colleague have mention from transport cost it be great to see the various announcement and project in the send review but we run the risk of they be undercut by this issue sufficient funding be vital for local authority such as hillingdon to have the resource to secure the requirement for child and young adult to achieve their full potential the billion in funding that the government have rightly set aside to well protect and expand send provision across the country be far cry from the shilling award back in the late however there be concern that there be lack of recognition of inflationary pressure as well as those relate to supply side matter such as fuel cost council such as hillingdon play key role in support child and young adult with special educational need these pupil be not ask for anything outrageous or to take liberty they just want suitable education provision to fulfil their full potential their parent and the local authority want they to fulfil their full potential we can realise the idea of universal education truly make it universal for all child and young adult across uxbridge and south ruislip and the whole nation pay tribute to everyone who provide educational provision across hillingdon and to parent and pupil for their amazing work with the difficult challenge around they congratulate my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis on secure this debate and the backbench business committee for grant it as in the rest of the country send provision in suffolk be in crisis we urgently need review not just of the funding but of how we provide vulnerable and very needy group of child and young people with the education that they need and deserve almost daily receive email first from desperate parent unable to secure an appropriate school setting for their child who quite often receive very little education at all and secondly from primary school headteacher senco and staff exasperate at be unable to obtain the support they need and at be ask to provide schooling for pupil who really should be in specialist setting the system be break and the situation have be exacerbate by inflationary pressure since and covid it often take year to obtain an education health and care plan on which there probably be too great reliance in the waveney area school and staff be do great work include the ashley school and castle school east but we urgently need more local provision and to get away from model whereby vulnerable young child be drive hour around suffolk and norfolk in the remain time available shall briefly focus on four funding issue first as we hear from my right hon friend the member for west suffolk matt hancock suffolk receive very poor high need block funding settlement it be base on historical need and bear no resemblance to the need of today local authority with similar send responsibility receive wildly different and well funding settlement suffolk as we hear be founder member of the the funding discrepancy that exist both in my own county and across the country must be even out as matter of urgency secondly it be important not to forget the vital work do by further education college such as east coast college for college disadvantaged funding should be reform to include specific block to support student with send who do not have high need for high need funding in college tariff should be set at level that will allow college to recruit and retain support staff thirdly it be all too easy to overlook the bespoke need of specialist further education college that provide education and skill training for those with send who be age to at this stage it be important to remember that special educational need and disability legislation require local authority to create local offer from birth to age for young people with send specialist fe college play vital role and although they be publicly fund they be not currently eligible for the capital revenue support to address raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete that inequality should be remove finally it be great news that gcse for british sign language be on the way and congratulate my constituent ann and daniel jillings on all their campaigning work to make that happen but there be an acute shortage of qualified teacher of the deaf to teach this new exam the national deaf children society highlight the immediate need to train more qualified teacher of the deaf hope that my hon friend the minister will keep that particular request in mind in conclusion there be national crisis in sen provision and it be feel particularly badly in suffolk as whole we be badly let down large number of student their family and their teacher in that respect support the motion review of funding should take place without delay congratulate the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis on secure the debate and on the strength of his opening speech which set out well the issue face across the country many colleague have already outline the overall funding challenge face send service so give the limited time will focus on another aspect the impact of delay in diagnosis and the wide opportunity for make an impact on this issue which inevitably impact on the funding of it it might be helpful to illustrate the issue be face by use the example of barton hill academy in torquay want to thank the principal samantha smith and her team for the work they do to inspire and educate so many of our next generation particularly those with additional need barton hill academy have two classroom for student with additional need one for young student with issue such as autism and another for slightly old student with mental health and behavioural issue it deploy several staff member to support those student many student be wait for diagnosis through the nhs the school have assign member of staff to help support parent of child with autism through the process and to fill out the referral form but it be still difficult process the delay in get an assessment and diagnosis through the nhs which be not directly relate to the education system inevitably have an impact because until there be diagnosis there be not the ability to provide the service that be need or in some case to look at move to more appropriate provision one key issue raise be that headteacher can be leave with rather unenviable choice they can keep someone with they who be clearly have an impact on the wide school when the type of resource they have available be not suitable for they that say they know that the issue be not so much behaviour as the fact that the pupil concern have medical need that be not be meet and be await diagnosis that can lead to the unenviable process of decide whether to exclude the pupil which be far more suitable in the case of those with behavioural issue in practical term headteacher feel that that be the choice they must start to consider give the impact on the wide school and the fact that it be not set up to deal with that pupil need but in moral term it be highly unlikely to produce the good outcome for the child this really come back to the issue of get the assessment do and ensure that there can be clear link between an nhs service and the impact for send one family opt for private provision because they be tell that there be three year waiting list for an appointment with paediatrician for an official assessment which would have mean that their primary school child would be at secondary school before they see any outcome from the assessment the family pay for private diagnosis but some local authority do not accept such diagnosis as basis for educational provision it be useful to discuss with torbay council the challenge that it face although welcome the improvement that have be make in the delivery of child service in torbay under number of political party in recent year council representative cite the impact of early intervention through family hub we need to ask what provision there be when people start to home educate their child and think some review could be carry out in that regard we also need to ask what can be do about prioritisation in nhs list rather than people work methodically through backlog there should be point at which child who be in need of treatment but face potential exclusion from mainstream school could be prioritise for appointment that become available for the usual reason why an appointment might become available at short notice be interested to hear what the minister can say about family hub funding beyond next year and about what focus there will be on overall sen skill across the wide teaching profession senco be clearly important but now that more child with additional need be in mainstream school this be an issue that more teacher be encounter there be also the question of attendance target in the context of funding and how that can be gradate for those with fairly low attendance finally there be the need for co ordination with the nhs the debate have give we welcome chance to discuss these issue and again congratulate my right hon friend on secure it like everyone else will start by congratulate my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis on secure this important debate one of the key priority in my campaign to be elect to this place in be to give child in the aylesbury constituency brilliant start in life and that mean all child include and indeed especially those with special educational need and disability be pleased to say that there be several specialist send school in my constituency have have the privilege of visit many of they include pebble brook and booker park chiltern way academy and the independent pace centre the work they do be awe inspire and pay tribute to their staff who constantly strive to give the child for whom they care the good possible opportunity and experience too often however the family of the child with send feel that they be be leave to fight ferociously complicated system to get their child into those school and ensure that they have the support they need thankfully they have local support from people in similar position include member of the grasps group which be run by volunteer in buckinghamshire but they have tell at length of their concern about delay in assessment complexity in form filling and then the long wait for the ehcp about which we have hear so much this afternoon the team at buckinghamshire council and have discuss those concern to try to find way in which to help and know that the team be determined to do so but it be no surprise that the council have highlight funding as major challenge as we have hear the cost of send education can be exceptionally high and it be not unusual for the cost of residential placement for child with the most complex and serious need to run to hundred of thousand of pound year the send green paper and the send and alternative provision improvement plan publish in march make clear the need to update the funding model the government be not ignorant to this and be pleased with their direction of travel we have an excellent minister to drive that forward in the month ahead be pleased that billion of high need funding have be allocate for the come financial year represent cash term increase of it should be stress and it have be that high need block funding have nearly double in cash term since which demonstrate this government commitment to help send pupil and their family however buckinghamshire council fare very poorly compare with many other local authority with much low allocation of funding the cost to all local authority of provide support for send pupil be increase dramatically both because of the number of case and because of the complexity of need locally since there have be increase in request for ehcp since the unit cost for child placement have increase by as result bucks council be look at bring some provision in house to try to contain some of the cost but that can not happen overnight in the meantime it must try to find the extra money member from all party will know that have profound interest in youth justice have spend many year as youth magistrate and as member of the youth justice board have always be strike by the disproportionate number of young people with send in the criminal justice system accord to datum publish in by the department for education and the ministry of justice of child caution or sentence for an offence have be record as have special educational need at some that be an appalling statistic it can not be morally right that so many child with send wind up on the wrong side of the law and all too often behind bar we must do more to give child with send the appropriate education and training so that they have the same potential to live law abide life as their peer and we must ensure that provision for those who unfortunately end up in the youth justice system be properly tailor and fund end on positive note many member of this house run an annual competition for local schoolchildren to design their christmas card for the past two year have do something slightly different have go out to local send school one each year to ask they to produce the design for my card and the reason be very simple all too often child with special educational need be airbrush out or consider incapable of achieve the same as their peer but take different view want local child with special need to be celebrate for what they achieve want they to be visible and want to give they showcase in the local community the simple act of get they to design my christmas card have enable to do that and thank the child at booker park school who design my card and the child at chiltern way academy who do it in both card have excellent picture that carry real meaning this emphasise that there be potential in every child and we need to approach child with special educational need and disability with spirit of optimism and positivity call the shadow minister congratulate the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis on secure this important debate and thank the backbench business committee for allocate time pay tribute to the teacher support staff educational psychologist speech and language therapist and all who work with child with special educational need and disability be grateful to every right hon and hon member who have contribute to today debate we have hear heartbreaking story from across the country of the desperate situation face the family of child with special educational need and disability and we have also hear about the impact on local authority and professional of system that simply be not work the sheer number of contribution this afternoon speak to the magnitude of the issue and the depth of the crisis we have hear from the hon member for worcester mr walker for mansfield ben bradley for tewkesbury mr robertson for hastings and rye sally ann hart for uxbridge and south ruislip steve tuckwell and for aylesbury rob butler and from my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and my hon friend the member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury about the funding crisis in send we have hear from my hon friend the members for harrow west gareth thomas and for selby and ainsty keir mather and from the hon member for gedling tom randall for twickenham munira wilson and for bracknell james sunderland

north west alex sobel for south shields mrs lewell buck and for york central rachael maskell about the terrible battle that parent face we have hear from the hon member for south west bedfordshire andrew selous for bracknell for waveney peter aldous and for torbay kevin foster about the intolerably long wait that family face for diagnosis and ehcp we have hear from the right hon member for rossendale and darwen sir jake berry and my hon friend the member for sheffield hallam olivia blake about the intense shortage of staff to support child with special educational need and disability we hear from my hon friend the member for wansbeck ian lavery and other about the financial impact on family of system that can not deliver the support that they need after year of conservative governments the system of support that child with send and their family rely on be beyond break point far too many family of child with send face battle for the support their child need it be often battle that have to be fight many time over throughout child life battle for recognition and diagnosis in the early year battle for support in primary school another battle to find the right secondary school and ensure that support be put in place and further battle to secure place in further or high education the consequence of this fail system be heartbreak for family precious child be make to feel that they be the problem and ultimately attainment of child with send go backwards that leave family increasingly reliant on go to the court to get the support to which their child be entitle it can not be and be not right that the government failure to provide an efficient court system be now ration access to the entitlement child have we each get only one childhood and support delay be support deny this issue should be an urgent priority for the government the current system be fail child and their family and it be an increasingly prominent factor in the number of council issue section notice in effect declare bankruptcy because they can no long balance their budget this issue be on the national risk register for the department for education so what have be the government response they delay their send review first announce in three time much of the send and alternative provision improvement plan will not come into effect until six year after the review be announce during that time child with send will have leave secondary school have spend the entirety of their school education under an increasingly fail system of send support the childhood trust have find that family of child with send be disproportionately affect by the cost of live crisis and be more likely to be live in poverty than family of child without send that be in no small part drive by the great difficulty that family of child with send have in find suitable childcare place throughout the early year for before and after school care and for old child during the school holiday we know that one in four parent across the board have have to give up work due to the cost of childcare and the figure be much high for parent of child with send our education and childcare system should deliver for every child in the country child with send deserve so much well than the complacency and neglect they have suffer for the past year and the piecemeal stick plaster measure that be now be propose labour believe in high and rise standard for every child we will work with parent and carer local authority health service and professional to deliver for child with send we will work to make mainstream school inclusive for child with send we will ensure that teacher and support staff have the training they need to work with the diverse range of child who be in every classroom throughout

lady for her intervention she will know that it be not the protocol for front benchers on either side of the house to support private member bills she will also know that my colleague the shadow education secretary comprehensively set out this week the priority that labour place on school attendance and the package of measure we will put in place to start to improve situation where we have dire crisis across the country the right hon lady be right to bring that issue forward through the mean available to she her private member bill and wish her success with her attempt to raise the priority of the issue and to seek action from the government to address it we will ensure that teacher and support staff have the training they need to work with the diverse range of child who be in every classroom across the country with new annual continue professional development entitlement we will ensure school be inspect on their inclusivity as well as the attainment of child by change the ofsted inspection framework we will roll out evidence base speech and language intervention for the young child because we know that unlock communication be an essential foundation for learn we will increase mental health support in every school and we will join up record to reduce the exhausting battle parent face as they have to retell their child story to every professional they meet on that point will the shadow minister give way will not it have be long debate and the minister need to come in shortly we will build an early education and childcare system that work for child and family from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school and we will put money back in parent pocket with free breakfast club in every primary school ensure no child have to start the school day hungry and by place limit on the cost of school uniform this government have be fail child and family for long year labour will put child first again and we will work to rebuild the support for child with special educational need and disability which have be so badly break on this government watch congratulate my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis on secure the debate know how passionate he be about ensure that his constituent get what they should from the send system and ensure that his granddaughter chloe get the support she need he make powerful case for both before go any far formally congratulate he on the announcement of his knighthood which be well deserve honour for his decade of public service by way of background be an mp in an area so be familiar with the case the organisation make and meet the group towards the end of last year have be child minister since the end of august but in the two year before be appoint to that position the issue of parent and teacher be unable to get the support they need for child with send be already in the top two item in my casework and surgery appointment pay my own tribute to all the staff support child with special educational need in school college and alternative provision both locally and nationally the issue raise in the debate be very familiar to in previous debate have talk about parent have what they feel be war of attrition with the system to try to get the support they need for their child that be war that any parent would wage but no parent should have to we know the system be not deliver consistent support and outcome and that there be significant financial pressure on it despite considerable government investment will begin with investment and funding as that have be the big issue discuss this afternoon as have be touch on the government have increase the high need budget considerably in it will be billion which be high than the figure in in the past two year there have be increase in per head funding in the constituency of my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden most member would agree that that be considerable amount of money as my hon friend the member for bracknell james sunderland say in his speech some member may only agree with that privately but not many government budget under any government or in any area have increase by which demonstrate the government considerable support for and commitment to the area we have two programme support local authority that face financial pressure in their send system and number of member in the chamber have local authority involve in those programme first the safety valve programme which include local authority with the high percentage deficit help local authority pay down accumulate deficit and reform their system by march the department will have allocate nearly million through that programme and if what we be try to deliver be deliver those deficit will be eradicate secondly we have the deliver well value programme for those with substantial but less severe deficit which involve local authority include east riding of yorkshire in the area of my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden that be help to deliver high quality outcome with sustainable cost under that programme each area develop reform plan and receive million to support its delivery as have be touch on the high need budget have double since but even if government be able to triple or quadruple it that would not by itself deliver the outcome we all want to see parent and teacher know that and frequently say that the issue be not just about money my hon friend the member for mansfield ben bradley make that point well in his speech and intend to pick up with he the discussion about conflict priority the system need reform which be why we publish our send and alternative provision improvement plan last year with the aim of get child and young people the right support in the right place at the right time there be lot within the plan but wish to draw out three key area briefly because they be the one that have come up most this afternoon and be in the petition attach to this debate first on special school provision and capital funding which be raise by the hon member for harrow west gareth thomas and other we be make billion investment billion of which have already be allocate that be on top of our delivery of new special and alternative provision free school there be currently special free school open and further have be approve to open in the future secondly on combat regional variation the plan will move we towards national system with national standard which we have never previously have across the country we now have nine change programme partnership which each have between two and four local area together with local school health service and parent what they be do be for example test an ehcp template that we hope can be use nationally which will improve the timeliness and quality of ehcp we be develop national standard of support for special educational need begin with one for speech and language which will be release later this year we be also publish local and national inclusion dashboard which parent will be able to access they will be able to see how their local area be do which will drive accountability thirdly my hon friend the member for torbay kevin foster ask about the skill and knowledge of staff in mainstream school our teacher standard already include clear expectation that teacher must understand the need of all pupil include those with special educational need but we be review the core content framework and the early career framework to improve their confidence in this area we have universal send service programme which more than staff have already access to improve their knowledge and skill we be also fund the training of early year staff with level senco qualification as my hon friend the chair of the education committee say some staff have begin that training so we be on track with that report january vol there be many other point that want to respond to but have only eight minute so will just say to my right hon friend the member for west suffolk matt hancock and my hon friend the members for tewkesbury mr robertson for south west bedfordshire andrew selous for gedling tom randall for waveney peter aldous for aylesbury rob butler and other that understand their point about regional variation it be base partly on deprivation and other factor and partly on the historical spend factor that have be refer to be happy to sit down with anybody to talk about those thing to the hon member for sheffield hallam olivia blake say that it be already the case that school have to be outstanding in all area to receive an outstanding grade from ofsted and it be not the case that we have target for reduce ehcp or indeed any other such target in conclusion reiterate my thank to my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden for secure this debate and to all member who have contribute to it we may disagree on certain aspect of how to achieve this but we be unite in our desire to ensure that the send system provide excellent outcome to all child and young people and that be what this government be determined to deliver as we see early this week clear injustice induce an

london and westminster nickie aiken thank she and her colleague for secure the debate be proud to represent the constituency with the large jewish population in yorkshire and indeed on the entire east side of the united kingdom for over year jewish people in leeds have contribute so much to our city culture economy and society they stand at the frontline of the battle against oswald mosley fascist in the battle of holbeck moor in and have often be at the forefront of our local political history across the city the jewish community in leeds have fantastic history and it be go from strength to strength in that be thank in no small measure to the hard work and dedication of everyone in the community but thank in particular the leeds jewish representative council and the jewish leadership

domestic abuse and sexual violence still miss sheila every single day the hon member for cities of london and westminster mention danny finkelstein book which be proud to be read at the moment have be give copy of it it reflect in many way the story of my own family hope the house will indulge as use my last three minute to tell little about my family history which in many way sum up the history of the jewish people in this country the british jews as the hon member say early my father mario reynaldo uziell come to this country in to escape the increase persecution of jews across europe at the time his family live in the hague but they move very quickly to paris they live in several major city throughout europe and my father himself be bear in vienna when at the age of he arrive at brentwood school boarding school in essex he could not speak word of english but he master it very quickly so much so that by when he have be in the country for only eight year and still have portuguese citizenship he volunteer for the british army however because his first language be french the special operations executive nab he and say you french speaker we need you to help the resistance in france that be dangerous for jewish man but he volunteer to do it none the less do not know what part he play in the resistance know about his training but he never speak about his experience in occupy france probably for very good reason and certainly because he have sign the official secrets act still have the document that my father sign in pledge his allegiance to king george vi so that he could become naturalise british citizen there be an example of somebody who start his life as continental jew speak french whose family originate in bulgaria the ottoman empire and thessaloniki then know as salonika where my grandfather be bear but who proudly become an englishman he never have an accent he learn english early enough to avoid speak with any accent unlike both of my grandparent one of whom have french accent and the other german accent on my mother side of the family we have very proud connection to the late rabbi jonathan sacks whose aunt rose be also my aunt rose rose goldberg she live until the end of her life she die only about year ago in brondesbury park which be very near where grow up in willesden finally before my time be up want to pay tribute to some of the holocaust survivor who find their home here in britain especially three of my constituent one of whom be no long alive one of they be trude silman who be this year trude escape from bratislava to come to the city of leeds and she because the first woman to qualify with biochemistry degree from the university of leeds she be still as clear and articulate as she ever be very active mind the second be arek hersh who be in the polish ghetto in łódź and be take to the concentration camp and be finally release from auschwitz when he be year old the third be iby knill who write two excellent book but sadly pass away just two year ago along with the many holocaust survivor they contribute to our collective knowledge of judaism here in the united kingdom they be proud british jews after the father of the house the time limit will go down to five minute which we will have to enforce strictly or else not everybody will have the chance to speak it be an honour to follow the hon member for leeds north east fabian hamilton and thank he for what he have do he remind of the book write by our former colleague tristram hunt about the original champagne socialist the communist friedrich engels and the life that people have in his part of the world as well as in north london also commend the book by hadley freeman house of glass which be three year old it be about how her family come to survive and what their life have be like be we to be have debate on the history of muslims hindus or sikhs in this country think we would have the same kind of attendance what be different about jewish history be what be put to by one of my constituent after october why do they keep pick on we there be million jews in the world of whom about quarter of million be in this country their contribution have be magnificent and not just those who be know in my previous job some time back put neon light outside theatre and cinema in the west end one day our painter ask whether he could have day off say of course and ask why when he say that his mother have die ask whether could come to the funeral he burst into tear because he do not know that anybody else know that he be jewish and he be overcome by the idea that someone would volunteer to come to that kind of family event be shock that someone in my country could feel like that my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken whom thank for introduce the debate mention esther rantzen have not actually know that esther rantzen be jewish until go to her wedding see desmond wilcox try to become jewish in term of music dance and everything else be amazing however it be not just the significant people we need to consider when go on almost pilgrimage to gallipoli to see the graf and name of the people from my constituency who have die keep come across memorial to jews who have serve in our armed force the same thing apply in every walk of life whether notable or just notice if we keep our eye open one of the reason why have support the proposal of the national holocaust memorial commission to have memorial and learn centre and the stipulation by the uk holocaust memorial foundation that the majority of the money should be spend on education be that since that proposal first come out have gain by know how many of my grandfather extend family die in the holocaust we think it be but that figure go up to and it be now well over that be the kind of education that matter hope that my grandchild and great grandchild if there be some will learn about our history and how inclusive it be and how it be chance that allow some people to go on and put down root while other do not get that chance because of ideology or the murderous habit of too many people also want my child and grandchild to know about the way jews have be treat in this country over the past year or so which have not be good and have not be easy remember every time go to church that jesus be not white englishman who belong to the church of england we have to remember our share history and try to adjust the way we work together and do not just want to talk about the abrahamic faith because the same thing apply to other faith that have different tradition and different origin our future be together and the soon we learn what we can about each other and what we share the well have say that my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster mention sir simon milton have be to two well more than two jewish funeral but go up to the bushey new cemetery when the bone be discover in the imperial war museum and its location can not even be show for fear that it will be attack and when go to the service for sir simon milton that also have to have strict security at one of those funeral member of the community security trust come up to and say you peter bottomley and when reply that be he say in word that can hardly say you one of the people why believe it safe to remain in this country if we can defend each other we can do well together the motion that have be so ably put before the house today pose the question of the potential merit of jewish history month potential merit we have already hear some wonderful story this be not about merit this be necessity we must have such thing so that we can promote learning as the father of the house say as well as understanding and historical knowledge because it be through an understanding of the historic place that the wonderful contribution many jewish citizen have make across these island that we will ensure that the hatred and antisemitic attitude that have prevail too often will be do away with so commend the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken for move this motion and say yes absolutely we must have such month the holocaust educational trust which have be cite by member already have demonstrate how necessary historical knowledge of the torture and persecution of the holocaust be for the child of today take forward that lesson let we therefore apply it in this way many people today have proudly boast of the great contribution that jewish people have make and not only in their own life and those of their own constituency but across this country the president of israel be isaac herzog who think previously hold three ministerial post his father chaim herzog who be the sixth president before he be bear in cliftonville avenue in belfast his father rabbi herzog who live in dublin be know believe it or not as the sinn féin rabbi because he be so in favour of the new dáil éireann that have be create and he be recognise as such it hurt my heart today to see the horrible attitude that some people just say some people from republican background now have towards the jewish people and towards the state of israel so strong be the history of the jewish tradition within the history of the irish that some of the found father of the israeli state actually hail from ireland both north and south and they have make wonderful contribution indeed in our own history in our great shipbuilding heritage of harland and wolff guess who mr wolff be he be prominent jewish politician from belfast and he make wonderful contribution he be close friend of sir otto jaffe lead politician and twice lord mayor of belfast he be also president of the belfast hebrew congregation and he serve our country so well let we embrace that remarkable history rather than hide it under bushel we must let it shine so that people can understand that the rich tapestry of the christian the hebrew and the arabic heritage that pertain on these island be strong and must be encourage for all to see so that we can understand our future it be pleasure to speak in this debate and pay tribute to my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken for secure it agree with everything that have be say so far on the need for we to have jewish history month as other have say the history of jews in britain be wind up in the history of this county and at time sadly it be complex history in my region of yorkshire that be clearly demonstrate by the two city near to one of which grow up in people will remember the massacre of jews in the city of york but york have thriving jewish community today the history of jews in york be also see in place name such as jewbury where my ancestor live in more recent decade the relationship have be complicate we see it now in the rise in antisemitism but in my birth city hull we have the battle of corporation field in when mosley and his british union of fascists turn up to be meet by crowd of people who be proud to say be mainly there to see they off and that be indeed what happen will talk today about the contribution make by jews from the city of hull and hull place in jewish history more broadly today the jewish community in hull be small but its contribution to jewish history be significant especially in the role the city play in the transmigration of jews flee eastern europe at the end of the century who pass through hull largely on their way to north america so many come to hull that the city be market as britain cheap port now we in the humber do not like to think of ourselves as cheap but that be what we be at the time it be estimate that over million emigrant pass through the city of hull in the century before and through our fellow humber port of grimsby most be pass through on their way to north america or to other city such as leeds and manchester but small number remain in hull at its height the jewish population of hull account for of its people but they have huge impact on the life of the city let talk briefly about the public life of some of hull jewish people between and hull have two jewish mayor seven jewish lord mayor and jewish leader of the council who serve effectively from until this be very consensual debate but here must disagree slightly with my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster who talk about her city as the part of the county where jews have have the most impact hull newspaper editor arthur tidman write in the there be no town no city of the uk where jews have be more closely identify with public life or where their natural ability have be more freely exercise to the advantage of the community it be doubtful if any other city can equal the record of hull in the number of jewish citizen who have fill the high civic office chief among those individual be alderman sir leo schultz the labour leader of hull council from to he be elect to the council in prior to that he have win scholarship to oxford but be tell that he could not attend because of his background so he take his fight into politic he have the foresight before the war to build bomb shelter in opposition to the government at the time who in the end relent and pay for the shelter to be build people who be bomb out of their home on the second night of bombing in include my grandma might not have survive be it not for sir leo foresight he have such an impact on our city remain as leader of the council until be knight and go on to become an alderman there be statue of he in the city and he be just one of number of individual include former mayor henry feldman and alderman john symons who have have huge impact on public life and not only in our city but in our country it be an honour to follow the hon member for brigg and goole andrew percy and pleasure to take part in this debate thank the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken for secure it particularly at this moment as it come at time when we be acutely aware of the critical growth in antisemitism in this country it would be tempting to focus on that issue alone but as serious as antisemitism be do not think it be the sole reason why we should be think about british jewish history month when start to think about this debate do not realise how limited my appreciation be of the contribution that the jewish community have make to the rich diverse culture that we enjoy across the uk yes be aware of most of the entertainment and industrial figure who have already be mention on the political figure who could not be aware of manny shinwell our liberal leader herbert samuel and other who have grace this place such as malcolm rifkind one of my favourite author if may focus on scotland for minute be edinburgh own muriel spark who give we some real gem include the unique the prime of miss jean brodie spark be among the crème de la crème of not just british but international literature and what contribution she make do not know that my own alma mater the university of glasgow be groundbreake when in levi myers graduate without have to take christian oath that attract an influx of student to scotland the majority of scotland jewish community continue to live in and around glasgow many of they be descend from those who come here to escape the russian pogrom in the it be apparently cheap to live in glasgow in those day than it be in edinburgh and have absolutely no comment to make about the current situation in the housing market few hardy soul have make it across to our side of scotland over the year indeed in scotland the history of jewish community can be trace back to edinburgh in when the minute of edinburgh town council record the application of david brown profess jew to reside and trade in the city and see the founding of the first formal jewish community in edinburgh of around family in tenement in richmond court in newington be acquire and become synagogue with seat by the community have reach around in the edinburgh university jewish society be found it be the old in scotland and possibly in britain and it be currently the fast growing sadly my more recent interaction with the jewish community have be as result of the rise tide of antisemitism meet rabbi rose in pub near that synagogue in newington to discuss how can support our local community have do tour of north london with the cst and hear heartbreake tale from jewish schoolchildren of the antisemitism they face on an all too regular basis meet lord john mann to discuss his report on antisemitism in the uk and last year present bill to try to force social medium company to report on action take against the abuse of people with protect characteristic which would include religion to return to my original point antisemitism should be problem that we overcome like islamophobia and every other form of religious racial or personal discrimination it should never be the dominant or only factor when we take into account what our jewish community have contribute to our history but to do that fully and properly and to value that contribution we need to set aside some time month each year to mark it celebrate it and record it to ensure that come generation know about it it be pleasure to follow the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine and to speak in this debate about jewish community and the merit of have jewish history month both of course have great merit recent event alone exemplify why history be so important as think winston churchill say those who ignore history be condemn to repeat it one of the thing that characterise jewish community around the world as well as in the united kingdom be hope indeed the israeli national anthem be call hope and it be not an exuberant or jingoistic melody in fact it be rather melancholy move tune that somehow reflect its message of hope rather than jubilation as many national anthem do rather than speak about the jewish community as many member on both side of the house have do would like to speak as it be to the jewish community some week ago speak about why there be cause for hope despite the increase in antisemitism and would like to continue on that theme say to the jewish people of the united kingdom and indeed any listening that many civilisation who have persecute the jews have rise and then fall the jews continue to thrive one need only to look at the arch of titus in rome to see how empire come and go and rise and fall the arch be build year ago by the romans under emperor domitian to celebrate the destruction of the temple at jerusalem it depict the plundering of that temple but just few week ago that arch celebrate the destruction of the jews be light up in the colour of the israeli flag by the government of italy to mark the pogrom of october there be many reason to be hopeful we should ignore the hater in community around the world who have clearly be responsible for the massive increase in antisemitism we should ignore the hater on university campus who be bully jewish child have hear from those young people who be frighten even to go on campus eventually some of those account will become widely know and they will shock the nation we should ignore those in the international community and even in the united nations organisation where frankly there be blatant example of antisemitism and where just before christmas iran be select to sit on the human rights council we should instead celebrate those who be do so much those who be agent of peace and reconciliation whom we do not hear enough about we should applaud man like the bedouin not jewish man youssef ziadna minibus driver who save life from the nova festival in israel by respond to call to pick up customer from that event he drive into hamas attack and drive out with minibus full of jewish people they be alive because of he we should applaud the hero rami whom meet in israel few day ago who save over life by drive to and for into that war zone to rescue people we should applaud people such as the crown prince of bahrain who say what hamas do on october be war crime and an atrocity and it be important to get all the abductee out of gaza it be not easy for some leader arab leader especially to say those truth that be true leader there be also the emiratis ali rashid al nuaimi top emirati official say that the abraham accord be our future it be not an agreement between two government but platform that we believe should transform the region that be an heroic statement there be also the saudi defence minister khalid bin salman who visit the white house and reaffirm his country interest in pursue the abraham accord that be real courage and real leadership thing that the jewish community should and will value in this country and around the world we should applaud our own political leader on all side this be not partisan issue for stand up and do the right thing in the face of dissent we have of course great hero in our sovereign the king who can influence event he have long stand personal relationship love of the arab culture and deep interest in the muslim religion but in fact he have the chief rabbi as guest before his coronation so that he be able to walk there as it be the sabbath hero come in many form hope come through many route thank the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken for set the scene so well declare an interest as friend of israel my comment will reflect the support for that wee nation with big heart much like northern ireland northern ireland be case in point show not just the importance of the contribution make by the jewish community to the social cultural and economic life of the province but the interest in the history of contribution from the wide community since its inception the belfast jewish heritage project have attract hundred of people on its guide walking tour in belfast city centre the tour include familiar site in belfast with jewish connection some of which people bear and breed in belfast have no idea about for example the old library in the city the linen hall library be originally the linen warehouse of textile company call moore and weinberg the jaffe fountain in victoria square be name after daniel joseph jaffe the founder of the belfast jewish community and the father of the only jewish lord mayor of belfast sir otto jaffe as my hon friend the member for north antrim ian paisley mention in the belfast jewish heritage project be award grant of from the share history fund commemorate the centenary of northern ireland the share history fund be fund by the northern ireland office and administer by the national lottery lasting legacy of that grant be the interactive online jewish heritage map of northern ireland which tell the jewish story of more than location right across northern ireland we have much jewish history in northern ireland and that be by no mean an exhaustive list of the wonderful connection think of mcgill farm on drumfad road in millisle in my strangford constituency which be use to house child rescue from nazi germany as another place of interest the kindertransport child come through there it be clear that jewish history month in northern ireland would have no shortage of material and story and would have great deal of support from across the community can only imagine the scale of replication in other community across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland as we become aware of how intrinsically link the people of the jewish faith be to the fabric of our british culture that be key in this debate for which the hon member for cities of london and westminster set the scene they be part of what we be as british people and we should welcome they as the leader of the house say in her excellent contribution early today the content for the month be there there be also need for people to understand the connection between we all in northern ireland be painfully aware of the problem with identity politic and forget the connection that bind we as one person who be on the jewish heritage walk in belfast put it it be amazing to have an hour long history tour of belfast that be not about protestants and catholics sadly there be good cause to enhance an appreciation and understanding of jewish contribution to northern ireland as it be not immune from the surge of antisemitic incident and attitude record by the community security trust there have be so much go back to include attack by vandal desecrate headstone and the blue plaque to chaim herzog be remove all the thing that have happen between belfast and israel represent remarkable connection just over century ago belfast have future israeli president chief rabbi and foreign minister live in it disgracefully the disuse jewish section of the city cemetery have be repeatedly desecrate and vandalise would welcome jewish history month because it would increase awareness among the general population of the remarkable place of the jewish community in our society challenge antisemitic stereotype and myth and inject confidence and pride for the jewish community itself the jewish people be not some sect to be observe but part of we the good of british that should be understand and emphasise not simply for month but on an ongoing basis until these people cease to be ostracise or hat simply because they worship god in different way from someone else they be people use to persecution but that do not make it right they have hope in god the same god that worship but let they find hope in this place as we highlight the wonderful good that have be do and be still to come from those who be british and worship their god with dignity and respect in no way offensive to any other person or religion do not have time to quote psalm but recommend that member read it afterwards because it will tell they all about the israeli people and how their god look after they thank my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken for secure the debate early this week lead westminster hall debate on the appalling rise of antisemitism we have see in the uk since the october attack that debate be sadly necessary give the circumstance but be glad that today we have the opportunity for much more positive debate to acknowledge the enormous contribution of the jewish community here in the uk wish to open my remark by recognise the jewish community in the west midland some of whom meet in the week follow the awful event in israel on october many in the jewish community have personal connection to those directly affected their strength and bravery in the face of terror have be commendable and today reaffirm my commitment to stand with the community in their hour of need at singers hill synagogue in birmingham meet rabbi jacobs who tell how the jewish community stand with the muslim community in the wake of the attack on innocent muslims in the day after the late rabbi tann visit the imam at birmingham central mosque at the time to show solidarity lead to the formation of birmingham faith leaders group which continue to this day rabbi tann gesture be reciprocate in the wake of last year attack with the imam visit singers hill synagogue for friday night service alongside other faith leader to show support for the local jewish community this be more recent development in the history of the jewish community in the west midland but one that they be proud of most know that birmingham have long tradition of thrive jewish community but most be not aware that wolverhampton once have one too thank to the jewish genealogical society of great britain which have pull together year of record we know more about that community in wolverhampton the building of the synagogue still stand but today it be church in after the community have collect they build wolverhampton synagogue which be open by chief rabbi dr adler in after fire it be rebuild by local architect when the community stop grow and number reduce the congregation merge with singers hill synagogue today we have five active synagogue in the region all contribute to the community and promote understanding tolerance and harmony between people of different faith in our area they open their door to thousand of child each year to learn more about judaism and commendably they organise donation to charity help to provide for those in need it be only right to pay tribute to some of our local rabbi rabbi jacobs rabbi hambling and rabbi pink like all religious leader they inspire their community they be their support and their guide they be there for advice celebration and difficult time too it be not just religious leader who do so much for other ruth jacobs be perfect example of that through organisation such as the west midland jewish representative council which she chair as well as the nisa nashim group an interfaith forum for jewish and muslim woman to bridge the divide and discuss their cultural and religious similarity ruth commitment to the community extend to her role as chair of the west midlands friends of israel and her work with the local police and political leader she also run the local hillel house which provide housing and support for jewish student and host many social and religious event it be people like ruth who make the west midland community so warm and friendly while play their part in make the region well place for all community it be not possible to mention all the contribution the jewish community in the west midland make to our region and across the country but will try to fit in few more the king david school in birmingham be beacon of light in the west midland it be jewish primary school which welcome all faith and have majority of muslim student would like to mention mindu hornick mbe holocaust survivor who settle in birmingham with her family she have give her testimony of the holocaust to thousand of people across the country and have speak in countless school in our region many holocaust survivor like mindu be selfless in the work they do and we owe they great deal she be one of the many uk base survivor who have give their testimony in conjunction with the holocaust educational trust chai cancer care be london base charity that offer specialised support service to cancer patient around the country include in the west midland it provide advice counselling physiotherapy and other support service from stirchley in birmingham visit its headquarters in hendon last year with the jewish leadership council and it be incredible there be many other jewish organisation that sit under the umbrella of the jlc that all do incredible work include jewish women aid united jewish israel appeal and the union of jewish student those be just some of the example of the contribution of the jewish community in the west midland and across the country in the west midland we be incredibly diverse have one of the most diverse constituency in the country the jewish community in the west midland be small than elsewhere but it well and truly punch above its weight as have give example of today the black country also have proud history of jewish community jewish history month would be the perfect opportunity to educate other about the history of the community that we may not otherwise know about as well as celebrate the enormous contribution the community make today again thank my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster for secure the debate today point that have make on many occasion be that all too often public understanding of the jewish community and the issue that matter to we will be limit to antisemitism and the uk relationship with israel and knowledge of jewish history will largely be limit to the holocaust that be not for second to diminish the importance of those three topic but to make the case for the fact that jewish history jewish culture and tradition and the jewish contribution to britain constitute much rich tapestry and we can all benefit from much deep understanding of it within the jewish community in the uk be represent mixture of different denomination ethnic and cultural background practice history and language and of course two of my favourite feature of that jewish diversity the food and the old adage of two jews three opinion with all this to teach and share our community tiny in size relative to the population of the uk and the globe can not be expect to undertake our endeavour to bring great awareness alone think it might be illustrative for the house if in demonstrate that every part of british history and culture be also jewish history and culture bring together two seemingly unrelated part of my parliamentary work to highlight the jewish contribution as british jew and of course member of the all party parliamentary group relevant to our community be also vice chair of the all party parliamentary group on wrestling thank to the historian bradley craig know of jewish flash al lipman from aldgate who be an immensely popular lightweight wrestling star in the in the wake of the war there be major show in manchester in aid of jewish charity in which the good guy who be jewish defeat the bad guy who be portray nazi more recently we have see the jewish global wrestling star noam dar who hail from ayr in scotland wrestle for world wrestling entertainment perform for million across the world and have win the nxt heritage cup he even once wrestle at jewish lad and girl brigade camp in essex an event organise by among other neil martin and robert rams two jewish

country other british wrestler and former wrestler with jewish link include the chutzpah lior ben david aviv maayan and max voltage olesker of the comedy duo max ivan of course there be numerous british comedian who be jewish or have jewish root british jews be also proudly involve in other area of the wrestling world example be wwe head of external affair tna pr man all elite wrestling press lead although he be in the united states the global jewish wrestling superstar mjf and the ring announcer justin roberts israel well know wrestling promoter gery roif come to britain and visit the house recently there be other here at home such as emily read co founder of the all woman promotion pro wrestling eve and adam cailler who write about wrestle for the daily star follow his stint at the jewish telegraph there be also the wrestling photographer oli sandler and danny stone the secretariat to both the all party parliamentary group against antisemitism and the appg on wrestling be well know across the house both for his expertise in antisemitism and in wrestling while small in number british jews have certainly make an impact on wrestle here in the uk and overseas in the hope that this will be the kind of debate that we will see much more in the future will not go through all the appgs and committee in which take part through jewish lens although that would demonstrate the number of area in the jewish contribution to british life of which there be so many beyond those that be establish or widely understand that jewish history month could explore indeed what have become run joke with my friend jonny newton occur on so many occasion that worry that we be will it into reality be the idea of start podcast call spicy talmud in which we would explore the volume collect century of rabbinic discussion on not just every single worthy topic one could possibly conceive of but the more esoteric question and the sometimes bizarre story that be recount about whistle frog weasel bring chametz from house to house snake go where they should and wine drink she dog thankfully for everyone sake think it safe to say that we be both far too busy for the foreseeable future but perhaps there be another way in which the kind of love that we both have and our wide community have for jewishness and our pride in be part of the jewish story can be bring to as wide an audience as possible so we can all share in it together and what well way to start than with dedicated jewish history month it be pleasure to follow the hon member for warrington north charlotte nichols not least because she have improve my knowledge of wrestle from absolutely nothing to slightly more than nothing celebrate all those jewish star of the wrestling world just as celebrate all those individual whom my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken and other have list from the world of entertainment politic industry and many more be delighted to say that the jewish population of buckinghamshire be grow it grow by between the and census stand shoulder to shoulder with the community which be proud to represent want to see it thrive and go from strength to strength notwithstanding the powerful comment that have be make about try to ignore the hater as my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis say we have to acknowledge that jewish community in buckinghamshire and across the country be hurt right now be privileged to join the south buckinghamshire jewish community at hanukkah event at waddesdon manor in my constituency in december lead by the wonderful rabbi neil janes his opening word during the short ceremony really shock he say we no long feel confident to gather as community that be in the united kingdom in of course every community should be confident to gather in the united kingdom in modern time they should all be afford our protection they should all feel safe put my thought about the event on social medium as we in this house have tendency to do and say not unreasonably that we must defeat antisemitism it take second for one of the hater whoever be to write underneath my instagram post strange word must be defeat what on earth be go through that individual mind see it yesterday under another of my post and have now report it to the police person take issue with something say about the conflict between israel and hamas it be perfectly legitimate for someone to take issue with my view on that ask on instagram be you married to jew such outrageous behaviour be happen in our country right now and it have to be stamp out want to say this in the chamber this afternoon and to support the call of my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster for jewish history month because one of the most important reason why we study history be to understand what happen in the past and to ensure that the mistake of the past the horror of the past and the evil of the past be not able to happen again yet we see history repeat itself which be why we simply must have jewish history month to celebrate the contribution of all our jewish community and everything they have achieve and will continue to achieve as members of parliament we all receive very difficult email we all have people come to see we at our surgery in very difficult circumstance with horrendous story to tell it be very rare that those story reduce we to tear but receive an email from jewish constituent whose identity will protect openly say have never feel as scared as do right now to be in the uk ve consider convert ve go to ground she have turn off the ability to be find on social medium that should scare we all it must put bounce underneath we to ensure that we defeat antisemitism and enable all jewish community all people of the jewish faith to live freely securely and safely and to feel welcome here in the united kingdom whether they be british or otherwise must begin by thank my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken for secure this debate learn great deal from listen to the contribution of members from across the house today the variety and richness of they reflect lot of what we be talk about the richness of contribution to british society that be the point wish to start with the british jewish community have make remarkable contribution to the prosperity of our nation in the face sadly of grow hostility abroad and shamefully here at home it be high time that we as nation celebrate its part in our national story so wish to do two thing in the few minute available to highlight the remarkable contribution make by the british jewish community in aberconwy today in do that wish to thank professor nathan abrams of bangor university and the team at llandudno museum for their important work in trace the history of the jewish resident of north wales and aberconwy and raise and then quickly dismiss an objection that we can anticipate to found british jewish history month in aberconwy although jewish resident have never number more than few hundred individual they have play prominent role in the recent history of our community sadly aberconwy be not without its reminder of dark past conwy castle and wall be of course build by edward who be notable for both his oppression of the welsh and his expulsion of jewish subject in primarily arrive in llandudno in the victorian era the new jewish community be soon key part of the area boom economy and be actively involve in the development and safeguarding of our local culture family such as the croops gubays wartskis and blairmans found shop that have become fixture of our high street visible to this day with the latter two found international antique business that continue to prosper we can also thank the wartskis for the synagogue in llandudno which open in it be testament to this legacy that modern day llandudno have the pleasure of welcome large number of hasidic family each year in more recent time the first woman mayor of aberconwy be jewish vicki lazar be elect in most recently in welcome twist of history in the care of those battlement in conwy that king edward build be vote into the competent hand of cedric rigal the first jewish constable and mayor of conwy with rabbi offer prayer at the inauguration however in make the case for celebrate and formally recognise such contribution in aberconwy and across the uk we can anticipate an objection albeit one raise in good faith in an era of increasingly divisive identitarian politic it may well be ask will such recognition encourage british people to think of themselves and one another in term of ethnic or religious group identity and do this not risk compounding rather than ease division as the mp for bilingual constituency proud welshman and brit think that that be profound misunderstanding of identity our british identity be not totalise it do not demand the erosion of the regional and religious identity that make up our nation we be privileged in britain to inherit nation that evolve long before liberal nationalist revolution of the century when nation such as france italy and germany be engage in assertive state lead nation building in contrast britain emerge slowly as network of kin friendship and trade bind together the destiny of the people of our island in many european state for example standardised education be seize on as means to erode regional identity yet here speak of north wales in this case the fierce independence and plurality of education have represent distinct religious and philosophical tradition in north wales would count our fierce tradition of non conformism in that too when community story have become intertwine with that of the nation it become part of the story of britain and such be the story of british jews it be significant and it be part of our story that deserve to be celebrate in world in which ethnic grievance be increasingly and easily stoke for political capital here be story of resilience and success the british jewish contribution to the art literature commerce and science of the uk have

eligible for the energy price guarantee the energy bill support scheme and the council tax rebate along with fuel and alcohol duty cut energy support alone have pay for almost half of the typical family energy bill from october to june through both the energy price guarantee and the energy bill support scheme it be in part thank to those measure that growth and real income have be strong than expect this year not just strong than expect by the office for budget responsibility but strong than expect by international economic forecaster inflation have also come down significantly to less than half its peak and in november it fall to which be the low rate in over two year again that be not forecast by the obr or international forecaster do not deny that the outlook for real income remain challenge it remain very challenging for many people particularly vulnerable people in my hon friend constituency and across the country as do inflation but that be why we announce further support in the autumn statement in november to support the most vulnerable the government will raise local housing allowance rate to the percentile of local market rent in april in plain english what do that mean it mean that million low income household will be well off to the tune of about on average in some particularly opposition member often say that that be not lot of money but can tell the house that for those million low income household it be considerable support that they will welcome as they will in my hon friend constituency the government will also uprate all work age benefit in full by the september consumer price index rate of which be considerably high than inflation to make sure that working age people on benefit be support properly that is percentage point high than forecast earning for and again it will help support the most vulnerable while inflation continue to fall with million household on universal credit gain on average in the financial year my hon friend

hard over year go by the basic state pension new state pension and pension credit standard minimum guarantee will be uprate in april in line with wage growth of in the usual reference period in the full yearly amount of the basic state pension will be high in cash term than in or to put it more simply more almost more than if it have be uprate by price alone that come on top of cost of living payment this year that be help more than million household on eligible mean test benefit million pensioner household and million people across the uk on eligible disability benefit for individual need further support local authority in england continue to provide support through the household support fund which be back by billion of funding this allow local authority up and down england to provide crisis support for the vulnerable household that need it the most such as through supermarket or food bank voucher this mean that from to total support to help household with the cost of living will be over billion at an average of per uk household however and the government know that relatively short term help be not enough the only sustainable way to help vulnerable people in this country include in my hon friend constituency and to improve the living standard be to build more prosperous future while remain fiscally responsible the good way to do that be to grow the economy and get more people into well pay job on grow the economy this be not the time for more statistic but will say this take together the measure in the autumn statement and the budget represent the big upgrade

the main rate of class national insurance for self employ people will be reduce similarly from to that tax cut be worth billion year and be the large ever cut to employee and self employ national insurance the obr expect that the measure announce at the spring budget and autumn statement take together will support nearly additional people into work by the end of the forecast period we do not do this for academic reason or for fun we do this because we know that give people more of their own money allow they to keep more of their own money improve their living standard and we can do this while increase funding for public service despite the difficulty of the last couple of year over the course of this parliament public service will benefit from the public purse by an increase above inflation of over we be do this while support public service while bring down the deficit and bring down the debt and we can do all of it because of our careful management of the economy that will
