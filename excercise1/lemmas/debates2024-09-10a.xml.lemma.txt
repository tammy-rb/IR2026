oral answers to questions justice the secretary of state be ask prison capacity what step her department be take to increase prison capacity what step her department be take to increase prison capacity today be the day that those on the opposition benches always know be come the legacy of the previous government be prison system on the brink of collapse which leave we with no choice today around offender have have to be release few week or month early by change their automatic release point from to of their sentence have we not do so we face court unable to hold trial police unable to make arrest and total breakdown of law and order this be not the long term solution there be more that we must do but it be the necessary first step that we have to take follow the disgraceful dereliction of duty of the previous government refer hon member to my entry in the register of members financial interests one way to reduce pressure on number be to treat more offender with drug and alcohol addiction outside the prison estate that reduce prisoner number and reduce reoffende which mean few victim and few people return to prison such system be operate successfully in many part of the country but it require the high quality treatment it also require probation to work well otherwise magistrate be limit in their choice may encourage the secretary of state to get hold of dame carol black internal review of treatment and recovery of drug dependent people in the secure estate if she have not already do so have not see it obviously but be certain that it will contain many excellent recommendation thank my hon friend for his question he be right good quality work on rehabilitation to reduce reoffende and deal with drug and alcohol issue be critical to deal with not just the rehabilitation of offender but the prison system he will know that nearly of offending be reoffende which be far too high the situation at the moment be that it be impossible to do good quality rehabilitative work in prison that be more than full with prisoner lock up for hour day so the first step be to address capacity once we have do so we will be able to build on recommendation make by expert in this area to make sure that we do everything we can to reduce reoffende thank the secretary of state for her answer my constituency of wrexham be home to one of the uk large prison it be well know that if an offender have fix and secure accommodation to go to they be less likely to reoffend what step be she take to ensure that those release today under will have accommodation on release include in wrexham we be work closely with colleague from the ministry of housing communities and local government to understand the impact on the housing sector but as be the case any time prisoner be release probation staff be work hard to prepare release plan include permanent and temporary accommodation if an offender be at risk of homelessness on release they will be house in community accommodation we expect to provide housing for the majority of offender use exist provision but should there not be enough have authorise probation director to make use of alternative arrangement include budget hotel as temporary measure for the case that we will see in the next few week during the debate on early prisoner release in july the impact assessment produce suggest that there would be few prison place than plan for because of the need to meet the capital saving that be discuss at the time when raise that with the secretary of state she say that this matter would be under review can she now confirm that it be the government intention to cut back prison place by over the medium and long term the right hon lady will know that have commit to publish year capacity strategy there be also live discussion as part of the budget and spending review process we have commit to deliver the shortfall of place in our prison system which the previous government fail to do that be commitment that we have give those conversation be live conversation and will report to the house in due course but we will publish that year capacity strategy before the end of the year can the secretary of state explain why when some foreign criminal be block up space in our jail they be not be remove and deport which would simultaneously save the british taxpayer billion of pound every year and have the support of million of british voter they be be deport and they will continue to be deport nothing will change as far as the deportation of foreign national offender be concern but the inheritance we receive from the previous government mean we have to take additional measure the answer will not come from the deportation of foreign national offender alone but it be very much part of the picture call the shadow secretary of state under the early release scheme start today the detail of which be design by the secretary of state how many people will be eligible to be release at the point who have be sentence for example for offence under section grievous bodily harm and section actual bodily harm of the offences against the person act both of which carry maximum sentence of five year but for which more often sentence will be award that be less than five year the shadow lord chancellor will know that we have make important exclusion in the design of the policy and that all those who have commit serious offence and have be sentence to four year or more will be exclude from it will not be able to give detail on the specific mix of offence per offender but those offence that would otherwise be include but that relate to serious violence or sexual offence have be exclude from the policy be grateful to the secretary of state but have the statutory instrument and the list of exclusion in the schedule here and those offence be not specifically include in that list of exclusion my fear be and this would be deeply disappointing that many domestic abuser who be convict for those offence but receive few than five year may be eligible for early release and be consider for it because her scheme do not explicitly exclude those offence give that the reality be that the government claim that domestic abuser will not be eligible to benefit from the scheme will ring very hollow to victim of domestic abuse and the wide public will it with respect to the shadow lord chancellor what will ring hollow to member of the public be the tory party new find commitment to exclusion for domestic abuse and the sheer hypocrisy of talk about exclusion to this policy when he be minister in the previous government who bring in the end of custody supervise licence scheme which have no exclusion relate to domestic abuse he talk about the governor lock from sedentary position but he know full well that that be an attempt to shift the blame away from ministerial decision making and to place it on governor something be not sure be much appreciate by those who run our prison we have take every step and every mechanism available to we to exclude offence connect to domestic abuse and crucially to give the probation service time to prepare something the previous government never do call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be clear that our prison be at break point the conservatives failure to tackle the court backlog have directly contribute to prison overcrowding thank to their neglect and mismanagement the government have be leave with no choice but to take these measure however the lord chancellor say in her statement in july that these measure would be review within month of implementation at the very late in march report july vol that be long time away particularly give the various story we be hear about certain individual be release will the secretary of state once again confirm that no dangerous criminal will be release early we have take every measure available to we to exclude offence from this measure serious violence sexual violence and offence connect to domestic abuse have all be exclude as have terror offence and so on the hon gentleman will know the list of exclusion we will work with our probation service which have do heroic amount of work over the summer to deliver this policy in the come month we will also work very closely with criminal justice system partner to make sure that the roll out of the scheme be as safe as possible we have take every measure we will continue to keep matter under review and will keep the house update in due course we need to speed up little we be only now get to question rehabilitation of offenders what step she be take to support the rehabilitation of offender what step she be take to support the rehabilitation of offender what step her department be take to help reduce level of reoffende hon member be right to focus on reduce reoffende nearly of offending be reoffende and it have an immense cost to the taxpayer and to community as the lord chancellor say we have inherit difficult situation in relation to prison capacity which make it hard to address the rehabilitation need of prisoner the house should have no doubt that this government will roll up our sleeve and get on with the job of reduce reoffende my point speak to what the minister just say the lack of prison capacity mean that some people be lock up in their cell for or hour day and many prison be rank insufficient or poor for deliver purposeful activity such as education and training how do the minister plan to address that while we still have bulge prison population how will he increase the provision of those purposeful activity we be take the hard decision that be necessary to create space and capacity in the prison service to address that issue the hon member be right that the report from his majesty inspectorate of prisons identify the provision of sufficient purposeful activity as its no issue to address we know that education and employment help to reduce significantly the chance of reoffende and we will work to do that with the prison and probation service rise order you be suppose to sit down minister know that you be enjoy the dispatch box on your return but please do not over enjoy it call monica harding as my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean mention the chief inspector of prison say this morning that prisoner can sometimes be bang up in their cell for up to hour day that classroom and workshop be empty and that education and training be simply not give the priority they need do the secretary of state agree that in order to cut reoffende it be time to introduce proper workable plan to improve the rehabilitation of people leave prison my own example demonstrate that training and education be very important in whatever role one take on so agree wholeheartedly with what the hon member say address literacy in uk prison be crucial for successful rehabilitation improved literacy skill empower inmate with well job prospect aid their reintegration into society education foster personal growth self esteem and decision make ability which be essential for crime free life invest in prison literacy programme be vital step towards create safe community and offering inmate genuine second chance what comprehensive strategy be be implement to address that my hon friend be exactly right literacy and numeracy be crucial be pleased to visit hmp humber recently where see excellent good practice it be important that those programme be in place that we learn from good practice and that we continue to do our good in that area key driver of rehabilitation and the prevention of reoffende be sentence policy in our manifesto we promise review of sentence policy quite properly when be that likely to take place and will it take account of the very interesting recent paper by former lord chief justices on sentence inflation the paper to which my hon friend refer be significant one and

to trial and that some of the poor traumatise victim be simply disappear because they could not stand it any long without enter into the blame game what can the minister do to improve that situation the hon member be right that although we do not want to get into the blame game the current status of the criminal justice system be truly appalling rape trial be not get as fast track as they should be and we be work at pace to try to remedy that situation currently of rape victim be pull out of the criminal justice system the attrition rate be far too high and be work with official to improve that rate and to improve victim experience at court how many prisoner be go to be release today in kent and can the secretary of state guarantee that none of they will be homeless within month as the

from be able to sit it will be priority for this government to resolve those issue so that case can be hear and victim can be give the justice that they deserve it be clear that we have come dangerously close to run out of prison place in the last few month which as the prime minister have rightly say be about as fundamental failure as you can get who do the lord chancellor blame for this failure and do she think we will ever get word of apology from the conservative party for leave our prison estate on the brink of disaster would happily give way to anybody on the opposition benches if they would like to take up the invitation to offer an apology but do not think one will be forthcoming certainly do think that one be require give the state of the prison system that we have inherit but it be our job to make sure that that never happen again that be why we will be launch review into how the current position be allow to come to pass the conservative party ignore all the warning put political gain ahead of the country good interest and it will fall to this government to fix it the government have rightly find prison place for those involve in the recent disorder but they have do that by continue their early release policy will the secretary of state confirm that those guilty of manslaughter be among those able to get early release and will she explain to the house why people guilty of manslaughter should be release early think the hon member be guilty of wilful ignorance he will know full well that the prison system that we inherit be on the point of collapse the fact that some prison build that be already in course be able to be bring on line little early to help we get over the crisis of the summer be testament to the people work at the frontline to make sure that those prison space be available but we be still short of prison capacity prison be still at over capacity and that be the legacy leave by his government he will know that we have important exclusion to the policy and he will know that the offence and the sentence be both take into account will not give running commentary on exactly which sentence and which offender be affect but he know what exclusion be in place court victim experience what step her department be take to improve the experience of victim at court this government be commit to improve the victim

complete chaos leave in the wake of year of conservative government in my previous work visit young offender institution which have be leave in total chaos by the last government part of their recklessness be to start botched recruitment process for the graduate recruitment training programme for prison officer it be currently deliver by unlocked graduates which be do fantastic work the government chief inspector of prison have say there be real risk that that programme ending will add to the recruitment problem that the government face will they restart that procurement process and

meet operational requirement be afraid there be currently no plan to reopen hartlepool magistrate court but would be happy to meet my hon friend alongside official from hmcts to discuss his concern the reason behind the increase caseload in our criminal court be complex and multifaceted but the number of courtroom available be not the main constraint we currently face torquay magistrate court

champion the right of old victim across the piece the ministry of justice provide police and crime commissioner with annual grant funding to commission local practical emotional and therapeutic support service for victim of all crime type be hear loud and clear the call from the sector but it would be wrong of to pre empt the announcement of funding after march we can not agree that before

hourglass that do such brilliant work another forum in which domestic violence be litigate be private child case in our family court the secretary of state and ministers will no doubt be aware of the

that they must wait two or possibly three year for decision on whether and whom to prosecute as martin luther king say justice too long delay be justice deny understand from the crown prosecution service which meet recently that much of the delay be for the discovery process where the welter of digital information must be assess can the minister tell what be be do to address these delay and whether thing such as artificial intelligence be be contemplate as the prime minister make clear those affect by the grenfell tragedy have already wait too long for justice can assure the hon gentleman that anything in my or my department power that need to be do will be do the government fully support the metropolitan police and the crown prosecution service as they complete their investigation and bring prosecution to trial while respect their operational independence be sure the use of all form of technology will be consider in that process perhaps too many barrister have become politician but however cause how will the minister address the shortage at the criminal bar hesitate to answer the right hon gentleman question give that my boss be former barrister say that we can not have too many only last week discuss the adequacy of number of legal professional in the crown court with the chair of the criminal bar association mary prior and will be work with the profession to ensure not only that we be recruit sufficient barrister to work in the court but that we be retain barrister at the criminal bar our team in newport east be try hard to raise the issue of how long case be take for constituent we inherit those delay from the conservatives but even the cps be take month to answer basic query about where the delay be in case will the minister urge the cps to respond fast will take that away and do that do the minister agree that properly fund legal aid scheme both here and in scotland be essential for access to justice and that the decline in this vital public service that both the tories and the snp have preside over be nothing short of disgraceful what we be experience be the very long tail of the legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act which have mean that both the civil and criminal legal aid sector have face huge challenge that be vital to people access to justice topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility on take office two month ago it be immediately clear that we have inherit prison system at the point of collapse that be why our emergency action which will see certain offender leave prison few week or month early have prove necessary the measure take effect today pay tribute to the work of the prison and probation service which have go above and beyond the call of duty both in respond to the violent disorder in recent week and in prepare for the introduction of those measure this mark the beginning of rescue effort one that will in time allow we to rebuild and reform our justice system in the year ahead after the last government leave our prison on the brink of collapse welcome the secretary of state commitment to build new prison and drive down reoffende also welcome her commitment to additional transparency do she agree that such transparency be significant departure from the approach of the previous government who release thousand of prisoner early in secret my hon friend be absolutely right that it be significant departure from the approach of the previous government who introduce an early release scheme the end of custody supervise licence scheme that operate under veil of secrecy with no datum ever publish on the number release it take our government to publish the datum show that more than offender be release under that scheme be pleased to say today that we have end that scheme call the shadow secretary of state be grateful to the secretary of state for her previous answer on substantive question about accommodation for prisoner release early far to that have the government contract any specific hotel for potential use by early release prisoner have authorise probation director in area to make appropriate provision if that prove to be need at this point it be not definite that it will be require to ensure that there be no gap in provision for offender be release under the scheme think the secretary of state say that none have be contract at this time if they be at any point far to the point make by the hon member for reading west and mid berkshire olivia bailey will she be open and transparent with the house local authority and the public about how many at what point and in broad term where they will be locate yes will call the liberal democrat spokesperson every second domestic abuse relate call be make to the police it be positive to see that the number of domestic abuse case refer from the police to the cps have increase but those number be still well below the level see over the past five year will the secretary of state address the delay in domestic abuse referral from the police to the cps and acknowledge the unique risk that they pose as have state this government be elect with landmark mission to halve violence against woman and girl within decade to do so we must improve the justice system response to these crime include domestic abuse we must relentlessly target the most prolific and harmful perpetrator well support victim and survivor and ensure timely and effective justice we will put domestic abuse expert in control room and strengthen the use of protection order and we will strengthen the tool available to manage domestic abuse offender over the weekend lord macdonald the former director of public prosecution warn that court backlog and the complexity of any trial that may arise from cps decision in about the victim of the grenfell fire may far delay justice could the minister give we and the victim reassurance that the criminal justice system will not far delay justice for those victim as say to the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler we will do everything we can to ensure swift justice for the victim of grenfell we plan for the crown court to sit for at least day this financial year and we will do more to increase the speed with which case be hear in the crown court the secretary of state have say that she will review her prisoner early release scheme after month but will she go far and commit to end it then and if not to return to this house for fresh vote on it have commit to the review because that be the appropriate way and will not make early promise that might not be keep have commit to both transparency and review we will publish all the datum on quarterly basis and will return to the house with the result of the review and the approach that we will take at that point the minister will understand that often for very personal reason victim of sexual assault such as my constituent do not always feel comfortable report their

condolence he express regard the tragic death of lieutenant leyshon as we have confirm previously reiterate without reservation that as labour do when in opposition we will continue to do everything possible to support the government over ukraine we remain steadfast in our total condemnation of both putin illegal invasion of ukraine and his conduct of the war during which he have show no regard for human life even it would appear that of his own service personnel with loss now at terrible level on all side indeed this be one of the secretary of state most striking point on the operational situation it be an extraordinary testament to the brutal disposition of the putin regime that their strategy continue to rely on the mass sacrifice of infantry personnel that say the secretary of state be surely right to remind we that despite the extraordinary naval success ukraine have enjoy in the black sea and the surprise incursion into kursk that have throw putin regime into confusion russia remain formidable foe and nothing at all can be take for grant on the contrary it be clear that the uk must continue to do all it can to support ukraine government people and armed force on the conservative benches we be proud of the role our government play in show real leadership in respect of ukraine if ukraine have fall early the world would have be in precipice situation akin to the late but we make huge difference to avoid that outcome by be the first nation to train ukrainian troop the first to provide main battle tank and in particular the first to provide long range weapon in august president zelensky comment that britain support for ukraine have slow down recently what assessment have the secretary of state make of those comment on these benches we recognise that key part of our leadership have be bring other ally on board which must continue in key operational and logistical decision making nevertheless we have also show leadership as sovereign nation that believe wholeheartedly in ukraine fight for freedom as such confirm that we would have no hesitation in support the government in continue that leadership be they to confirm that the ukrainian government have maximum freedom of operation with regard to all the munition we have supply include long range missile on the provision of additional munition and the late news share by the secretary of state welcome the announcement of million for air defence missile to be produce of course in belfast that underline the intention we have in government when the late round of support commence to ensure maximum degree of benefit for the uk defence sector in our support for ukraine will the secretary of state confirm that that remain top priority and that as we supply ukraine with more and more drone across defence he will ensure that we rapidly learn the lesson of their deployment so that we can build the ecosystem for our own sovereign uncrewed sector we agree that supply ukraine with arm have be the right thing to do but and the public feel this very strongly that must be accompany by the replenishment of our own stockpile and platform inventory top priority of our fund timetable commitment to be an additional billion to replenish our munition be the secretary of state still commit to that extra billion for munition can he confirm that the delay in set out clear timetable to will not lead to the deferment of any major munition order either this financial year or next the secretary of state speak of russian artillery outfire ukraine by and he know the crucial importance of industrial output that be so do he recognise that we must urgently fire up production across our own defence sector by commit to as soon as possible finally one lesson from ukraine be the vital importance of maintain air superiority in battle in relation to our future combat air capability ask the secretary of state set of write question on july on the sixth generation global combat air programme spending and he have to date answer only the question on historical spend not those on the current financial year will he therefore confirm whether his department will be defer any spending on gcap plan for the current financial year thank the hon gentleman for his support his tone and his commitment to continue to back further military aid to ukraine include the million contract for lightweight multi role missile that announce last week he talk about the mass sacrifice of russian personnel and he be right president putin be leader who show contempt for the life of his own soldier on uk leadership have set out to the house my determination to maintain that leadership in the support for ukraine and demonstrate how we step that up in the first week in the week that follow and last week at ramstein in term of the lesson for drone their deployment and our work with ukraine we be learn those lesson we need to speed that up give the hon gentleman previous job he will be well aware of the implication for the way in which we procure and contract for capability both for export and for our stockpile on stockpile we have as he will also know so far spend billion in the uk on replenishment we have plan to build that because we need to boost not just production but the productive capacity of uk industry so that we be capable of demonstrate that it can be scale up in the face of future threat in way that be not apparent at present the hon gentleman ask about long range missile have to say that only putin benefit from an open debate about those sensitive issue and will not comment on operational discussion there have be no change in the uk position we continue to provide military aid to ukraine as have set out to support its clear right to self defence and in line with the operation of international humanitarian law on the question of we will increase defence spending to of gdp the last time the uk spend of gdp on defence be in when last stand at this dispatch box as part of the previous labour government in the conservatives cut defence spending they never match in any of their year in office my priority will always be to ensure that this country be well defend in the face of grow threat we will do more to make britain secure at home and strong abroad thank my right hon friend for his statement and the commitment to support ukraine as we have see previously welcome his statement about the investment in lmm defence can he say bit more about the scope of that have say that ukraine be my first order priority and be in odessa on my second day in the job have now have the privilege of meet president zelensky four time while in post and have meet his defence minister six time like the previous government we consistently try to respond to the need that ukraine say it have for system and ammunition at the moment above all it need new supply of ammunition and strong air defence system capable of take down russian missile and drone at different distance while the us make commitment at ramstein last week to an extra million in air defence system we make commitment of an extra million through short range modern air defence lmm with production under way the first of which will be deliver to ukraine before the end of the year we be step up the support that we pledge for ukraine and speed up the support that we deliver to ukraine call the liberal democrat spokesperson on behalf of the liberal democrats wish to add to the tribute that other have pay to lieutenant rhodri leyshon he serve with the commando helicopter force in naval air squadron at yeovilton the royal navy say that rhodri be one of their most trusted and highly capable aircraft captain and instructor our thought be with his family be remind of the saying train hard fight easy it be attribute to the century russian commander field marshal suvorov but the russians be not practise that today send to the front russians who have have as little as two week training by contrast the training that have be provide under operation interflex have enable ukrainian troop to hold ground and exploit russian weakness the liberal democrats welcome the announcement last week at the ukraine defence contact group that operation interflex will continue until the end of indeed we have welcome announcement on ukraine from the current government and the previous government and we would not want to see any party political capital seek from the solid british support for ukraine we have see some failure by the british state in recent year to plan for contingency whether post invasion planning for iraq or for non flu pandemic we have discover that sometimes in the british state there be little bit of hope for the good on support for ukraine by the united states what contingency planning be be undertake for an uplift in our support for ukraine and by other state in the ukraine defence contact group in the event that gap open up with us administration under trump and vance be sure that lieutenant leyshon family will appreciate the hon gentleman comment the outcome of the us presidential election will be determine by the american people this country have deep relationship with the us it be our most important security ally and we be its most important intelligence ally the relationship go back decade and have survive the up and down of the political cycle on both side of the atlantic we be determined that it will do so again whatever the result of the election on the question of training can not match the hon gentleman in cite century military figure but can say that the mismatch between the level of training that we and ally be try to provide to ukrainian troop be part of the attempt to counter the outmatch in number on the russian side can confirm to the house that that include not just the ukrainian troop train so far under operation interflex since putin invasion but the pilot train in english and technical matter as well as fly and almost ukrainian marine train by the uk work with ally that be why be able to make the announcement last week at ramstein that this important uk training effort link into the new nato arrangement will be part of the way that we equip ukraine force for the future to be well prepared and train than their russian adversary let we be under no illusion in the face of russian aggression and invasion the defence of the uk start in ukraine my right hon friend the defence secretary be right to focus not only on the immediate challenge face ukraine but on the long term imperative do he agree that the uk ukraine friendship be not just for the short term or for as long as it take but must endure in the year and decade to come do indeed lot of attention be give to military aid to support ukraine short term need its immediate battlefield requirement but in the long term we need to reinforce ukraine capacity to produce for itself that be why an important element of the step we have take to step up support for ukraine since the election just two month ago have be to sign defence export treaty which be privileged to sign with defence minister umerov in no downing street it provide some billion worth of export credit guarantee that will help we do more to get the equipment ukraine need manufacture and export and into ukrainian hand for its fight against putin invasion thank the right hon gentleman for his statement people in ukraine be face great challenge and we can see how much resource russia be throw at the situation most colleague on the government benches feel it be time for storm shadow to be allow to be use with freedom by the ukrainian people will the right hon gentleman set out the legal restriction that be stop that from happen conflicting briefing have be come out of government that be not matter be prepared to discuss openly as such debate would benefit putin the principle upon which this country have give and will continue to give weapon to ukraine be that those weapon support ukraine defence and its right to self defence as sovereign nation to do so across the board do not preclude ukraine from strike target in russia if that be part of that determination and strategy for self defence and provide it be within the bound of international humanitarian law without wish for one second to diminish the threat of putin russia or the sacrifice that ukrainians continue to make note that moscow airport be close by ukrainian drone attack this morning that the russian central bank will raise interest rate to on friday and that half million russian troop have be kill all of that have be inflict by country that be third of the size of russia do the secretary of state share my frustration that so many people in the west seem to accept the misinformation war putin version of event that this war be go swimmingly for he when any rational assessment of the event of the last two and half year show that they have be an absolute catastrophe for russia my hon friend be right part of the battle that putin be wag be with his own people to control their freedom include take step to assassinate political opponent and their right to freedom of information one thing that have put president putin under pressure be that ukraine have take sq km of territory in the kursk region to defend its own city and centre in the north that have bring home to president putin and the russian people the consequence of his aggression and show that this be not special operation simply confine to ukraine ukraine have the right to self defence in do so ukraine be try to defend itself well by strike target in russia from where the russians be launch the deadly attack from which ukrainian civilian city and power system have suffer for too long what assessment have the defence secretary make of operation renovator and how do he plan to change it the right hon gentleman ask question with good deal more information than the rest of the house will write to he with the detail he seek rather than try to give superficial answer from the dispatch box welcome the defence secretary statement especially what he say about the deepen military and industrial strategy between the united kingdom and ukraine there be clearly grow alliance building between russia and iran unite in undermine democracy and risk further proxy war will the defence secretary give his assessment on how the uk government seek to influence iran my hon friend follow these matter closely and speak with authority in the house on these thing we have be warn in fact the previous government be warn too about the deepening security alliance between iran and russia part of the declaration make alongside international partner at the nato summit in washington warn iran that any transfer not just of drone technology but of ballistic missile technology to russia would be regard as significant escalation the house can take broad lesson from my hon friend point iran destabilisation be not malign influence that be simply feel throughout part of the middle east but have wide repercussion which be why iran be one of the most serious threat to this country in the future the secretary of state can look forward to the same support for ukraine defence from the snp that the previous government enjoy he mention increase air defence come from the uk and the united states that will be in ukraine before the end of the year russia will not wait until the end of the year before attack civilian infrastructure particularly energy infrastructure so will the secretary of state advise of any step that have be take to accelerate that increase air defence to the benefit of the people of ukraine be grateful for the hon gentleman continue commitment and support give on behalf of his party to stand with ukraine in this house for some month the ukrainians have be say they want delivery of the pledge of military aid to help with their fight against the illegal full scale invasion they want what have be promise to be in their hand that be why when first meet president zelensky on my second day as secretary of state for defence make point to not just say to he right this government be willing to step up the support we be offer but to tell he that we recognise that imperative and will speed up the support we offer we will speed up the delivery of the big package of aid announce by the previous government in april and we will try to say to president zelensky where we pledge our support we will give you guarantee about the delivery time by which it will be in your hand to strengthen your fight for your sovereignty and against this illegal invasion strongly welcome the confirmation of the extension of operation interflex over this year and next will the secretary of state join in pay tribute to the hard work and professionalism of the uk troop involve in the operation and the bravery of all the ukrainian troop who be serve to protect their home my hon friend remind the house of very important point number be one thing we can say that the uk have lead the operation interflex nation to train ukrainian troop but more importantly the expertise of british and other ally soldier have help to provide the ukrainian soldier who be step forward to help defend their country with combat medical skill battlefield training and survival technique have the privilege to join the then leader of the opposition on salisbury plain to witness some of the training and later to talk to ukrainian troop who have finish their training at brize norton as they be poise to fly back to ukraine they be man very much like any in this house lorry driver accountant and public relation executive who be now alongside their civilian colleague fight for the future of their country and the right to decide as sovereign nation its future in the world pay tribute to their bravery and to the skill of our armed force in help to train they for that task we have have quote from suvorov and napoleon famously say that the moral be to the physical as three be to one after two and half year of barbaric russian invasion we can not expect the ukrainians to keep resist with one hand tie behind their back that mean that while the russians attack power station with long range missile at will with winter come and while they use glide bomb which be brutally effective as tactical weapon on the frontline we have to allow the ukrainians full freedom of action to retaliate not just as military necessity but to maintain their own morale they must be bolster to keep go we could help they and it be about time that we do that one thing the right hon gentleman make his very strong point in his customary way this be about not retaliation but self defence and he be quite right to say that the impact of the moral often outweigh the impact of the physical when update the house on the physical the sq km of the kursk region that be now in ukrainian hand the moral or morale impact on ukrainian troop and ukrainian citizen have be huge so just as it be put pressure on putin it be also lift the spirit of ukraine after nearly day of bloody battle against putin invasion the secretary of state spend the last sunday of the election campaign in prestwick near our town world war two polish war memorial within day he be in odesa and have step up and speed up the support that the uk be deliver do he agree that we have start as we mean to go on and that this government will stand with ukraine for as long as it take yes do it be real pleasure to see my hon friend in his place he bring expertise from very wide field of foreign policy affair know that he will make big contribution to this house and if make small contribution to his election campaign then be doubly pleased to see he the secretary of state be consistent supporter of ukraine in opposition so it be no surprise to hear that positive statement from he today when he go into battle with the chancellor of the exchequer for good defence budget will he remind she that in the and the cold war we regularly spend to of gdp on defence will he also assure the house that if america elect president who do not wish to support ukraine the support for ukraine by the remain european member of nato will intensify not diminish when as government we declare that we be ready we show that by step up support for ukraine when we say that we will stand with ukraine for as long as it take for it to prevail we mean it whatever the decision of other country may or may not be do not expect whatever the result of the us election for the us to walk away from ukraine say in my statement that if big country with authoritarian ruler can redraw international boundary by force the sovereignty and security of all nation be leave weaken on the question of defence spending we be government who will not be have battle as the right hon member put it but will go into the discussion that will inevitably have with the chancellor with copy of our labour manifesto which at the election say that we be government who will spend of gdp on defence we will increase spending on defence which be entirely the opposite of what happen when we have the change of government in that be government who cut defence spending over those first five year by nearly may thank the secretary of state for his statement but also the ministers who have provide cross party briefing to colleague it really be appreciate president zelensky have call on partner to ensure that aid package that be announce be deliver to ukrainians as quickly as possible will the secretary of state set out the action that the government be take to ensure that aid to ukraine be speed up my hon friend be quite right step up the pledge of aid be one thing but speed up the delivery be another that be why on that second day in odesa make an undertaking to the defence minister and president zelensky that this be government who would do both be able to update the defence minister in ukraine of progress on each of the element of the package that we have pledge thank the right hon gentleman for his statement even though he have announce nothing new today very much welcome that he be keep this matter at the top of his and the nation agenda although he may be able to say little about this will he forgive those of we who can speak for continue to press for the west to untie the hand of our ukrainian ally so that they can strike back at those who be strike at they illegally and without justification we know that that probably do not apply to this government but will he confirm that there be discussion with our ally about this matter may wish he every success in help we to deliver the freedom and security of the world by break the stalemate in ukraine that will overwhelm the west if we allow it to continue thank the hon gentleman for his comment and for his welcome to note the point that he make on the point about my not announce anything new just say to he that do so on friday last week this be my first opportunity to update the house on the announcement of extra aid not just last week but in the week over the summer recess and indeed the package in our first week in office this be the fourth sitting week since the election and hope that he will be reassure by my personal undertaking to ensure that

northern ireland who have receive million of pound over recent year for not have do their job and not take their seat be to take their seat today and vote with many of we include some labour members the outcome might be different have the speaker office be inform that the seven sinn féin members intend to take their seat in the house today and actually vote to oppose austerity as oppose to just

debate call the shadow secretary of state pm beg to move that an humble address be present to his majesty pray that the social fund winter fuel payment regulations si no date august copy of which be lay before this house on august be annul the labour party the government say in the general election that it would bring in new style of politic politic centre on integrity and transparency so it be that during the election we hold they to account and press they on tax among other matter we will find out with the budget at the end of next month whether they be tell the truth have my suspicion but we have already discover one thing right now we also press they on the winter fuel payment from which million of pensioner benefit up and down the country why because the conservative party stand four square behind our elderly we believe that they should have security and dignity in their later year we receive cast iron assurance from the labour party in fact the then shadow chief secretary to the treasury the right hon member for bristol north west darren jones hon member where be he that be good question he say when press that the labour party have no plan to do anything in respect of the winter fuel payment indeed labour candidate up and down the country gleefully point to their manifesto as have no mention of do anything on this particular matter but look at what have happen in matter of few short week what happen to integrity what happen to transparency they go out of the window broken promise already the special contract that labour seek to have with the british people base on integrity and decency have be smash into million piece what be the impact of these measure to degree we do not know will come to that but we do know that nine out of pensioner will lose the winter fuel payment of up to at most difficult time of year for million of they and time when the energy price cap be go up by there be suggestion from labour member that somehow only the wealthy the millionaire be affect far from it two third of pensioner live below the poverty line will have this benefit remove interruption labour member do not like hear it the pensioner who we know be eligible for pension credit but be not yet receive it will also labour member chunter from sedentary position but although they say that they will have wonderful campaign to get everybody who be entitle on to pension credit in reality even if they do so it would cost the exchequer billion which be over twice the money that they say they will save it be an absurd policy that their own plan be actively work against the haste with which this have be carry out be simply jaw dropping we do not have any impact assessment will the shadow secretary of state give way will in moment we do not know what the impact will be across the income distribution no member of this house know what the impact will be within their own constituency we do not know what the recommendation of the social security advisory committee will be why because it will not be give the information until tomorrow we be tell and of course the measure do not form part of what it should major fiscal event with the office for budget responsibility score it and an economic and fiscal outlook accompany it rise will come to the hon gentleman in fact the only authority to comment thus far on these measure be the house of lords secondary legislation scrutiny committee which say we be unconvinced by the reason give for the urgency attach to lay these regulations and be particularly concerned that this both preclude appropriate scrutiny and create issue with the practicality of bring in the change at short notice that think say it all will the shadow secretary of state give way will give way to the hon gentleman who have be very patient thank the shadow secretary of state for finally give way will he clarify which conservative leadership contender have call for the means testing of the winter fuel allowance be leave feel that that intervention be barely worth the wait the fact that we even have debate today be near miraculous give the resistance from the labour party we have it thank to the scrutiny that the conservative party be provide to the government we know that petition have be rail against the measure people have sign the silver voices petition third of million the degrees petition and over half million the age uk petition they be call on the government to think again the press particularly the express newspaper be do sterling job in bring these matter to our attention even the trade union movement include unite be point finger at the government and say that they be pick the pocket of pensioner there be sense of disappointment yesterday the health secretary be drag in here because multimillion pound make consultant in the health industry be wander corridor with access to paper and today pensioner be be betray do my right hon friend agree that when people vote labour they think that they be get change and transparency they be promise high standard they be get the opposite thank my right hon friend for his appropriate intervention he be right of course the only surprising thing be how remarkably quickly this have all fall apart the government will take responsibility for what have happen they will blame we with this fictitious black hole the leader of the house have suggest invite labour members to support she in this assertion that the measure be necessary in order to avoid run on the pound it be just as well that labour be not in charge of the economy or we might end up in real mess do the shadow secretary of state agree that if local council have run its finance into the ground in the way that his party do to the country finance with billion black hole he would have call in the commissioner in the morning and instigate swingeing cut can ask give that that be the case and that he now seem to have decide that his party no long care about balance the book will he apologise order call the shadow secretary of state thank you madam deputy speaker that slightly lengthy question might be well address by way of rather lengthy letter to the leader of birmingham city council of course all politic be about choice and what this government have do be cave in to their trade union paymaster they have settle way above inflation junior train they have stand up for their trade union paymaster on the back of vulnerable pensioner and that be not right if it be not the case that the trade union be run the labour party hand up everybody on the government benches who have not receive money from the trade union for their campaigning or their private office hon member one one person therein lie the truth about who be run the labour party of course we have see all of this before under the last labour government we have the pension increase we have gordon brown stealth tax on private billion in total and be it any surprise that we end up with the fourth high level of pensioner poverty across the whole of europe the right hon gentleman talk about choice and pensioner when his party choose to suspend the triple lock in and give below inflation increase to pensioner cost they what be his concern then why do he say nothing the hon gentleman be entirely wrong we go into the election promise the triple lock plus unlike his party under which million of pensioner be go to be drag into income tax spend many of they for the first time we be prepared to stand up and say that we would not do that will the right hon gentleman give way how could not commend the right hon gentleman and his party for bring forward this issue which be massive for my constituent and those across the whole united kingdom say this with respect to the labour party this policy do not conform to any labour party policy that have see in the past pensioner who have contact say that they be concerned because the threshold be too low because pension credit will take nine week to process even if it get to the who be eligible in northern ireland and because the that the labour government have approve will not come until spring next year those be three reason why the motion have to be support the hon gentleman be entirely right as always and completely agree with every word that he have just say we be the party of the triple lock and we be the party of the triple lock plus we be the party that have raise the state pension by since and we be the party that have see few pensioner in absolute poverty since we come to office that be now go to go into reverse will now rather more gently and rather more quietly make an impassioned plea to government members look to your conscience you know in your heart that these measure be wrong that the labour party have break its promise and that these measure will lead to untold hardship for million of elderly and vulnerable people right up and down the country you now have an opportunity to join with we and put stop to it before start want to thank the house for put its confidence in to chair the treasury committee for the term of this parliament be the servant of this house and will question without fear or favour those who appear before we look forward to engage with the new member have yet to get to know also declare an interest my husband have be in receipt of the winter fuel allowance but if the vote change that today he will no long receive it for his own vanity should add that it be the low limit the decision that we be be ask to make today be difficult one but sadly it will not be the only difficult decision face the new labour government before the general election have the privilege of chair the public accounts committee for nine year in that role see all of the impact on public finance current past and future when hear my right hon friend the member for leeds west and pudsey rachel reeves talk about the challenge ahead and the dire consequence would say you think it that bad know it lot bad we have hear of the chuckle brothers but describe we as the misery sisters because when she say it be bad say it be go to be bad that be the reality the chicken be come home to roost on the spending of the previous government we see number of problem which lay out in my last annual report as chair of the public accounts committee factually accurate information the nhs capital budget be raid to pay for day to day expense but the backlog of capital expenditure in the nhs be billion in the year end as serve with the hon lady on the pac warmly congratulate she on her election as chair of the treasury committee the house have make very good choice member of the rayleigh rochford and district association for voluntary service whom meet last friday be genuinely worried about this policy in nutshell their argument be that if people on very modest income be now frightened to heat their home that could lead to illness for many of those people who will then present themselves to hospital and increase the winter pressure on by that method it would be false economy the game be not worth the candle what do the hon lady whom respect say to that thank the right hon gentleman with whom have the pleasure of serve on the public accounts committee that be an example of how the house work closely together most people would not think that we would agree on many issue but on that committee we produce every report in tandem the right hon gentleman will know that the pressure on the nhs be legion and that many of the same people who will be suffer this cut to their income we will come on to some of the measure to ameliorate it will be the same people queue and wait for hospital appointment know too many pensioner who do not get that hip replacement if they can not afford it but many be cash in their saving when they have they to pay for hip replacement so they can have quality of life that be not the nhs that the right hon gentleman or want to see in this country so we need to make choice one choice that this government be make be to ensure that we pull the nhs waiting list back could digress into the nhs for long time but if he will forgive will move on look at our school estate under the last government the department for education ask the treasury for capital funding for school of billion in it be allocate only billion so there be big backlog there in the defence sector there be many example but will pick just couple not single nuclear submarine that have come out of service have yet be decommission in this country it will cost around million in price for single one amount to nearly three quarter of billion pound in price to complete all of those it be get to critical point these decision have be delay and defer for too long in this case by government of all colour not just the last government and there be gap of at least billion in the defence equipment plan over year there be also lack of transparency about local authority spending because of the crisis in local government audit which be oversee by the last government not enough be do to deal with it could go on there be long list of expensive thing that this government now need to put right because of neglect over period of time rise let continue for moment there be budget challenge this year and many decision that be make in recent budgets will hit the public finance in or beyond because there be either huge optimism about the state of economic growth or deferral of painful cut different member of the house will have their own view congratulate the hon member on the post to which she have be elect she have just outline number of project for which public money need to be find as the shadow secretary of state outline the government decision today will save billion and the replacement they be put in place will cost billion how do that make economic sense and how do it help the case that she be make give credit to the hon gentleman for his chutzpah in come to the house today to say that it be this government who have denude pensioner of income as my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell highlight the previous government have track record in that area and there be pensioner who on the hon gentleman watch deserve pension credit but do not get it those pensioner have lose out on year in some case for many year because the last government fall down on the job they protect some pensioner but not all where be the urgency then these be crocodile tear when those people be suffer but it be right that pensioner should get what they be entitle to and pension credit be not be abolish by this government rather it be be promote to make sure that the very poor pensioner get that income one of the thing that be absolutely apparent be that we can not take this issue in isolation we have budget come on october and know what know few month ago as chair of the public accounts committee and what know today be not go to change my tune about the dire state of public finance however we face second challenge at the same time that our public finance be in that dire state many of our citizen face the same challenge in their personal finance this labour government be rightly commit to growth but that will require an approach to taxation that help ensure growth we will therefore hear many argument about the need for taxation system that will underpin growth thank my honourable friend for give way call her friend because we have work together very closely over the past few year and welcome her election would have support she for that role the difficulty be that the public be not buy it the government can not claim that they need to take this money from vulnerable pensioner over in my constituency will lose the support they be currently get and then reward train driver who work four day week on grand year that be the difficulty so how be my hon friend explain that to her constituent have not be able to give an answer could speak forever about the challenge that the last government leave have speak about the nhs but let we take the dire state of our train service the previous government refuse to engage and stop the strike which mean that anybody travel have no certainty about whether they could get to everything from work to family funeral life be put in havoc so it be absolutely right that we begin to set right the chaos that the last government leave yes there be cost to that so the challenge for my right hon friend the member for leeds west and pudsey and this government be how we address that make decision that will build up the future of britain in the way that we all want to see we also need to address the issue of taxation the big challenge in our taxation system be that those who face the great financial challenge often face the big challenge of all because the great cliff edge in our taxation and benefit system affect not those who be start to earn and accumulate wealth but those who be most financially challenge for those at the margin we keep come across example this be not the only one where the marginal cost of slight improvement in income can drastically outweigh that improvement whether that be tax threshold be freeze or the issue we have see with child benefit there be many more example and the debate we be have today be one of those the solution be not to duck or defer the need for tough choice so for the record will be vote with the government equally for the record though want this government to commit to tackle those cliff edge because that be what progressive policy include taxation policy look like like many member of this house know from bitter experience that rush law tend to be bad law so do not expect some houdini like solution to be announce from the front bench by my right hon friend the member for leicester west liz kendall in her closing speech instead expect and trust that she will consider remove those chain of poverty as key mission for this government in thoughtful carefully plan way one that be tie up with the next budget but go way beyond it also know as will many member that there be technical challenge in make change look at what have happen with child benefit the limit on income be drag many people into tax return where household of the same income do or do not receive child benefit depend on who be earn the money that be lesson in why change need to be make in sustainable way and accord to plan my right hon friend on the front bench and her colleague have plan but the winter fuel allowance which we be discuss now be prime example of the problem that those cliff edge create address those problem in isolation however will leave in place all the other cliff edge we need to look at challenging poverty in the round be honour to be choose yesterday to be chair of the treasury committee do not yet have committee member they be yet to be elect as be the chair of the work and pensions committee so can not speak for committee that do not yet exist on cross party basis but will be urge the committee to consider this wide challenge of cliff edge as matter of urgency look forward to work with ministers to find some practical step forward we have to make tough choice as government in year because one of the challenge be that the hole in the public finance be not just about the hole today in previous budgets decision be make to defer spending to later year so the real challenge be now too often have see call for efficiency saving and cut in year that end up be defer if we look at what happen to the defence equipment plan under the conservative government in we see that there be desire to balance the book in do so the ministry of defence defer spending move it to the right which leave we with aircraft carrier without aircraft and raft of other problem defer decision and spending do not solve thing and this government and this cabinet be make the tough choice to make those difficult decision in year because that be financially literate and the right thing to do call the father of the house if can reach out to the labour party for moment there be case for have serious debate about the total package that we give to pensioner we could have do that in sensible way have raise it myself have question some aspect of the triple lock couple of year ago it be very difficult debate but understand that the total package pay to pensioner as proportion of gross national product must not keep increase every year because that be the way ultimately to bankrupt the country we need to have social contract between old people like myself and young people particularly when it come to house building understand all that that be the debate we should have be have today and we could have combine as house to have that debate and protect the public finance however that be not the debate we be have we be debate the action of government who have not just go against manifesto commitment there be no manifesto commitment to do this but actually give specific promise that they would not do it this be surely question of public trust they give an absolute guarantee and think that be why people be so upset know that some people will say and here declare an interest why should somebody like receive the winter fuel allowance all right let we have serious debate about that but what about the people these be the people feel so strongly about who have work hard all their life have serve their country receive very small occupational pension do not receive pension credit and be look after every penny and suddenly because they do not and can not receive pension credit because they have very small occupational pension their winter fuel allowance be take away that will make real difference to they so we really have to consider they and have serious debate about how we be go to protect those people may make one suggestion to the government the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier allude to the fact that there should have be serious debate about tapering or something similar will tell the house what this be all about this be about punishment beat the new labour government decide they have to make their case that the public finance be in dire state and that there be hang on there be this billion black hole we spend billion every year the billion so call black hole be mere accounting device the labour government be try to make the political point that the conservative party run the country into the ground so we have to punish the pensioner it be absolute and complete rubbish what those we represent can not understand the people who work hard all of their life who have do their bit for the country and whose total package be perhaps or year be that this so call saving of public money be actually go to go to the train driver who earn year so for god sake let we have serious debate let we try to unite on this issue and let we not keep take away benefit from people just above the pension credit limit of course there be many pensioner who be entitle to pension credit who for all sort of reason will never claim it they be suffer so they will be even bad off there be another point to be make the government will argue that the total package will be worth more after the increase in the triple lock next year but actually pensioner who draw their pension before by the time they have have this cut will probably be even bad off the first cut in the state pension for year this be not acceptable this be not the right way to go about thing we should unite around sensible package that reward pensioner for their hard work but do not just indulge in political gesture recognise the serious economic context of the debate today the institute for fiscal studies for example have estimate that people be be push into poverty because of mortgage interest rate rise trigger by the disastrous autumn mini budget and of course the then prime minister make many unfunded policy recognise that the policy measure in the king speech will go long way to reduce household cost and increase income in the medium term but those tackle the appalling poverty that we be see will not come in time for this winter be proud that labour be continue with the triple lock on pension something that will be worth an extra but that will not happen until next spring the setting up of new energy production company great british energy alongside make home more efficient be fantastic initiative that will contribute to our net zero target and reduce energy bill for million but again that will not be in time to offset the increase in energy bill this winter support our focus on grow our economy but again that will not happen overnight the joseph rowntree foundation estimate in its report early this year that there be million pensioner live in poverty about one in six of all pensioner in area such as my constituency poverty rate be much high we have one in two child live in poverty from the figure we estimate that will be the same for pensioner we know that four in old people in oldham east and saddleworth have disability and almost half have long term health condition we also know that even before the escalation of energy cost over one in six household be live in fuel poverty although pension credit provide extra financial support for the poor pensioner and open up help such as housing benefit and council tax discount for those who be eligible for it only of the household in oldham be eligible to claim it again welcome the automatic linking of pension credit to housing benefit to increase the uptake but this again will not happen in time in the next few month will the hon lady give way be not go to give way thank the right hon member but can not because be under strict guidance from the deputy speaker one in three pensioner live in poverty be in the private rented sector so what be we go to do about that even if everyone eligible for pension credit be claim it accord to age uk there would still be another million pensioner slightly less badly off who will not be eligible for pension credit and now the winter fuel payment the cut off threshold for pension credit be just under year for single person these be not wealthy pensioner poverty be poverty whoever experience it and we know that we have million work people live in poverty as well as million disabled people million child and million pensioner as we do in previous labour administrations know we will tackle this but again it will not happen overnight could point out what we know about the health effect of the cold the lancet publish very good paper reviewing datum from the last year and it show the extra death the excess death as result of cold could mention dozen and dozen of case from my constituent who have write to and who again be just cling on follow the last year be my right hon friend the secretary of state able to say not just what other option she may have consider for offset the loss of the but what alternative way there be of raise the billion we will get from means test the winter fuel payment know how complex and difficult our economic situation be but please we must protect our most vulnerable citizen call the liberal democrat spokesperson recent week have see my inbox inundate with correspondence from pensioner in north east fife because it get quite cold up there who be deeply worried be sure in fact know that that be far from unique experience across this house since the chancellor announcement in late july we have all hear the concern of our elderly constituent we know that the winter fuel payment provide vital support during the cold month of the year it be not luxury and the chancellor decision will leave as many as million people extremely worried about how they will afford their energy bill this winter we on the liberal democrat benches accept that the new government have be leave with an unenviable task of rebuild our economy after the mess leave by the previous government no one be dispute that year of conservative mismanagement have leave the public finance in crisis but this cut be simply wrong it be wrong to strip support from many of the poor pensioner just as energy bill be set to rise again it be wrong to force vulnerable elderly people to make that choice between heating and eat this winter and it be the wrong answer to the challenge we face the way we treat the vulnerable member of our community reflect who we be as society what sort of signal do it send to be turn our back on million of pensioner in addition have campaign consistently for unpaid carer since my election as have my party and our leader my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey census figure with the proviso that scottish census datum be still await suggest that almost million people across the uk age over be provide unpaid care although carers uk await datum on how many will lose the winter fuel allowance we know that those carer and those they care for be some of the most vulnerable in our society on the disproportionate effect on certain group be sure my hon friend be aware that north norfolk be home to pensioner and have the title of be the old constituency in the country many of they already face high energy cost due to the huge number of north norfolk home that be off the gas grid do she agree that these cut will have disproportionate impact on old rural constituency such as north norfolk and that the government must go back to the drawing board with these misguided proposal that be one thing often lose in relation to the energy price increase that we have see in recent year the price cap and guarantee do not support those who be use other form of fuel those issue have be raise in the house before and look forward to hear what the government be go to do to support those individual new parliament represent an opportunity to move on from the chaos and misery of recent year but this cut would be far from fresh start it would be disappointing and shameful abandonment of poor and vulnerable pensioner age uk have strongly condemn the cut it point out that it have be introduce with virtually no notice and no compensatory measure note from the debate this morning when the minister for pensions be talk about compensatory measure that there be real complexity around what will additionally be available to support people we know the questionnaire that be need for pension credit we know that the household support fund have be extend but we do not know what that will mean we know that the grant may be available for some but after listen to the debate this morning we be leave in the position where the government have make decision to make the cut but they have not properly think through the consequence or the measure that will be available to support those most in need do the hon lady agree that in when the coalition government come in we inherit really serious economic crisis and genuine black hole and we have to make some very tough decision as coalition government but we never consider and never do this obviously difficult decision be make during the coalition the government be say today that one of the thing they be do be continue the triple lock one reason why the liberal democrats support and bring that move in during the coalition government and one reason why we continue to support it be that still not enough have be do to well support our vulnerable pensioner be sure the hon lady will acknowledge that scotland have the cold climate in the whole united kingdom we will be disproportionately hit it be absurd that that will happen in energy rich scotland will she appeal to all scottish members to ensure their support tonight constituent right across scotland will be watch carefully how scottish members of parliament vote tonight so will she encourage they to vote with we this evening we all know that geographical disparity exist there be difference in how cold part of the country be different community face differ energy cost and rate and have different mean of fuel we will be support the official opposition motion tonight and hope other mp across the house do so age uk have draw attention to low take up rate for pension credit around million pensioner would be eligible for pension credit but do not claim it often due to lack of awareness since the chancellor announcement we have see lot from the government about how they be go to increase the uptake report do suggest an increase in application but also that the wait time for that be increase if people be apply for pension credit and get it confirm only after the date on which the winter fuel payment be make will those people be catch up with an awareness drive be all well and good the dwp have state that its calculation assume an increase in the uptake of pension credit that will still leave more than eligible pensioner not get pension credit and therefore not get winter fuel payment those of we in the last parliament will remember numerous drop in and dear colleague to outline the step that the then government be take to encourage the uptake of pension credit and what mps could do remember write regularly in my local newspaper column to outline how people could apply but in reality the number of people take up pension credit be stubbornly stick at ceiling of would be interested to know what the government be go to do that will be radically different in order to increase that figure the government rationale be that an estimate billion will be save by mean test the winter fuel payment but have they make an assessment of what that saving would be if they fulfil that other stated aim of ensure that all those eligible for pension credit claim it be there not fundamental contradiction at the heart of this measure how can the government aim to boost pension credit on the one hand while aim to maximise the fiscal saving they be make through this cut what will it cost to increase the take up rate and can the secretary of state give an assurance that the treasury will give its full support to any measure aim at boost the uptake of pension credit separate but related issue be that of the cliff edge analysis by policy in practice show that around elderly people miss out on pension credit as they be just over the income threshold to claim the benefit we know that those vulnerable elderly people will now be cut off from winter fuel payment with just few month notice that leave feel that there be cruelty at the heart of this cut those vulnerable pensioner who have spend year struggle under conservative cost of living crisis be now face with double hit an increase in the energy price cap from october alongside be strip of those winter fuel payment it be important that we do not forget that energy cost be much increase from few year ago so arguably winter fuel payment be need more than ever this house have an opportunity today to do the right thing and protect those vulnerable member of our society the liberal democrats will support the official opposition motion and oppose the move to strip pensioner of that support hope other member will do the same rise order member will have see that there be lot of interest in this debate so will impose clear three minute time limit from now on be pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate on change to the winter fuel allowance like many of my colleague have be contact by constituent who be worried about the impact of these change bring to this debate year of experience of work in public health and with old people latterly as chief executive of national age charity during that time come to understand the impact of cold and damp home on the health and wellbeing of old people and the challenge of address pensioner poverty let we be clear with those pensioner up and down the country who will be lose their winter fuel payment about where ultimate responsibility for today decision lie it be not with my right hon friend the chancellor but with the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt and his party it turn out that the conservatives be pursue scorch earth policy the nhs run on empty the cost of housing asylum seeker spiral and hollow promise on capital project across the country include in my constituency know that the chancellor and her colleague have not take the decision to mean test the winter fuel payment lightly hard choice have to be make to put the country finance back in order we know that many pensioner will miss out and worry that they will be leave in the cold in my constituency people be eligible for pension credit but not receive it speak to resident in sheltered housing scheme in cottingley at the weekend he do not know whether he be eligible and be not sufficiently mobile to attend local community centre will the secretary of state work with colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government to urge housing association and local authority to support their resident to apply for pension credit and other benefit to which they may be entitle the other group who risk be leave in the cold this winter be those with disability or health condition or those who live in cold and damp accommodation cold home can cause and worsen respiratory condition cardiovascular disease poor mental health dementia and hypothermia in the nhs spend at least billion per year treat illness that be directly link to cold damp and dangerous home pensioner be more likely to be live in poorly insulate home lead to high risk of fuel poverty be worried about pensioner such as barbara in my constituency she be full time carer and her husband have dementia have to spend more money because she and her husband be at home and he be ill give the crisis that the nhs face as direct result of the year of funding pressure and cut from the conservatives urge colleague to work with colleague in the department of health and social care to ensure that winter planning guidance mean that the nhs tackle fuel poverty who would have think that prime minister not even in office for week would be so out of touch with the public yet here we be and yes this prime minister be so out of touch along with the chancellor and the whole of the cabinet who be go along with and support this cruel policy the chancellor should be under no illusion the public know that this decision to rob million of pensioner of their winter fuel allowance for which the government have no mandate have nothing to do with economic and everything to do with cynical political calculation the haste with which the change be be make be breathtaking all benefit regulation be require by law to be consider by the independent social security advisory committee that be generally do in advance of the legislation be lay in this case however the labour government have opt for the urgency provision which allow ssac consideration to be retrospective some say that be bypass ssac scrutiny as well as evade that scrutiny where be the government impact assessment on remove winter fuel payment from these pensioner particularly in the light of the late information that bill will be rise by this year there be people lose winter fuel payment in my constituency and many of they be among the people who be not eligible for pension credit but be below the government own poverty line what be they suppose to do well say what be bad that this labour government be so out of touch so early on in their government the unnecessary haste that this change be be bring in with the lack scrutiny of this policy or labour breathtake hypocrisy back in when the conservative manifesto state that we would mean test benefit the labour party reaction be one of horror say that this could not be do and publish research show that up to pensioner life would be at risk and that pensioner would struggle to heat their home the conservatives do not do it what be we see here we be see that labour party in office ditch its belief and its research this government have be tell pensioner that they do not want to do this but that tough financial decision must be make we all know however that that be poppycock as it be not the government message to the already highly pay train driver when they meet they money be no object they say have as much as you want the public be not as stupid as this government think they be this be good old fashioned pork barrel politic take money away from the people who the chancellor think do not vote labour such as pensioner to hand to people who she think do vote labour such as train driver and public sector worker million of pensioner many struggle to make end meet be be sacrifice in this political strategic game by announce the scrapping of the forthcoming and long await cap on care cost as well as lay the ground to remove the council tax allowance for single people labour have basically declare war on pensioner which will be neither forget nor forgive our pensioner deserve well than this it be time that labour reverse this decision and restore the winter fuel allowance to all pensioner in the interest of brevity associate myself with some of the remark make by my colleague on the government benches on the desperate financial legacy we have be leave and the nature of cliff edge within the benefit system we should do well than have cliff edge in the future let we remind ourselves that the subject of this debate be the opposition motion not to means test winter fuel payment let we face it that mean maintain payment to million of people include some opposition members who be happy to admit that they do not need it give the dire legacy the fragility of the economy and the immediate need for in year saving this be an emergency measure with all the other call on public spending can not see how such payment be the good use of billion or more at the same time know that many of my constituent on state benefit with small private pension simply do not have the income to meet their everyday need they fear not just the winter cold but every bill many have write to with heartbreaking story of everyday struggle just to maintain the basic quality of life we have hear some mitigation and we will hear about more let we remind ourselves that that include the fact that the poor pensioner will retain their winter fuel payment let we remind ourselves that people just above the threshold can apply for household funding support through their council my office in rossendale and darwen be already work hard with resident to make sure that everyone in need get the support they need we have already help number of pensioner to get the benefit they deserve and need at the same time we need to recognise that none of these step include the winter fuel payment itself address the fundamental issue of pensioner poverty we have to ask how this country can be spend more than billion year on pensioner payment when million of britons people who have do the right thing all their life work hard and pay in be still live in deep poverty and unable to afford the most basic comfort that be not something we should simply accept such deep pensioner poverty should be national embarrassment successive government have duck the issue winter fuel payment be one example of the stick plaster politic that have seek to kick the can down the road respond to problem but never fully address it the benefit be poorly target and for those who need it most it be not nearly enough to make the difference to truly address pensioner poverty we need fresh approach and to be willing to challenge the assumption of the past with ambitious policy that target the cause of poverty not just the symptom home insulation and low energy price with gb energy be just two example but we can and must do so much more we can only deliver real change with an economy that be fix and stabilise that be what this government be utterly commit to today hon and right hon member will make choice whether to take vital winter fuel payment from million of vulnerable pensioner include pensioner in my constituency it be important when member vote today that they understand the consequence of their choice it be important that they understand that when they take winter fuel payment away from vulnerable people some elderly people will die vulnerable elderly people on relatively low income will be unable to heat their home adequately and as direct result because they be cold they will die why they will die because cold be bad for people number of report that member may read demonstrate that when cold people platelet get high they vasoconstrict and their blood pressure go up put they at risk of stroke or heart attack their lung become inflame which put they at risk of pneumonia or chest infection it make people with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease more likely to suffer exacerbation and ill health study have show that physical performance and muscle strength take cap off thing or walk about be bad in people who be cold particularly elderly people that reduce their ability to complete the activity of daily live independently and it make they more likely to fall study have also show that elderly people who be cold in their home be more likely to need to get up at night to go to the toilet or to wake through the night that again put they at more risk of fall and therefore hospitalisation sleep disruption put they at risk from whole range of different illness we also know that as the home temperature fall far the risk increase it be proportional dose response relationship the house do not need to take my word for it there be lot of medical evidence to this end the chief medical officer say in his annual report last year cold home and fuel poverty be directly link to excess winter death my hon friend be make powerful emotive speech and quite rightly talk about some of the impact on pensioner do she agree that those be exactly the impact that should be capture in an impact assessment and bring before the house so that we can make an informed decision and that my constituent in arundel and south downs who may face loss if the motion be not agree to be increasingly talk about the right hon member for leeds west and pudsey rachel reeves as reckless rachel in proceed with this measure thank my hon friend for that intervention he be absolutely right why be there no impact assessment have my suspicion and my terrified constituent know why there be no impact assessment it be because they know what the impact will be be sure madam deputy speaker that your terrified constituent know what the impact of the policy will be right hon and hon member all know too as right hon and hon member vote they should be in no doubt that the government first job be to keep people safe and they be go to fail miserably it be pleasure to follow the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson we sit together on the health and social care committee and hear the evidence from sir chris whitty we know what professor sir michael marmot have be say for decade and the public health evidence be clear our inheritance be million pensioner live in poverty we have to protect they every single day they make the hard budgetary decision hard than those make in the treasury where there be choice they have no choice they have to put roof over their head they have to pay for their food and they have to pay for their heating we know that those sum be not add up we be get letter come in and we look at the figure that our constituent have to look at every single day they be scared and they be tell we that they will not switch the switch because they know that if they do they will have bill that they can not pay we need to protect those very vulnerable people commend my right hon friend the secretary of state for drive forward the ambition to get pensioner sign up to pension credit really hope that people will test the system there be question on the questionnaire and then of course there be nine week wait for it to be process but we must drive that forward the last government fail in that endeavour we must also protect those that who do not apply many may not for reason we know that they may have dementia and the application be complex and stressful perhaps there be pride involve as well we be talk about man and woman who work hard all their life they might have put little bit aside or they might not and ultimately we need to help they then there be the million people who be above the threshold they too need support because they be fuel poor and will struggle this winter as the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham say the cold put great demand on person body the body fight back but sadly as it do people be at risk of heart attack stroke and bad of course respiratory disease prey on the most frail and vulnerable when we look at where those people will go we see that they will be queue up at the gp and look to the nhs sadly many will not be with we it be with my conscience that can not vote for these measure but be determined to work with the government to find mitigation which be absolutely crucial age uk and many other charity be say that it be too late to find alternative they say delay say let we delay let we get this right we can not afford not to some pensioner in scotland be set to lose this benefit the prime minister and the chancellor have choose to cut the pensioner cost of live payment they have choose to cut the winter fuel allowance they have make the political choice to scrap those payment the uk labour government be desperate to meet their self impose fiscal target but make no mistake this be political choice they be try to meet those target by balance the book on the back of pensioner who out there in the real world vote for that this be key test for anas sarwar and labour mps from scotland anas sarwar say read my lip no austerity under labour if that be what he believe the platform he put to the people of scotland and what scottish labour mp be vote in on how can they possibly back the government today who be the master of scottish labour mps be it the prime minister be it the labour party or be it the people who elect they the people who put they here who will go cold this winter because of their government decision this be not the change that people vote for the uk government be trail break promise behind they they be refuse to scrap the two child cap they be refuse to allow pensioner the money to heat their home this winter that be not what people in scotland vote for and they will be devastate if their scottish labour mps support the government today thank you madam deputy speaker for the chance to speak in this important debate feel compel to do so because for nearly year be an active campaigner in the pensioner movement want to make it clear that the financial mess inherit by the government be result of year of austerity and financial mismanagement and reject any suggestion that public sector worker be benefit at the expense of pensioner that be well known to be crude attempt to divide work people and we should reject it as such in the short time that have want to make the case for universalism as the cornerstone of our welfare state we know from the late figure that old people be eligible for pension credit but do not claim it mean testing be suppose to target help at those who need it most but those people do not claim it for decade successive government have talk about need to improve take up but even in the good year the take up rate be of course some people do not claim it because they be unaware of what they be entitle to but most be wary about have to answer more than question about their circumstance and many charity such as citizens advice in my constituency do not have the capacity to help people fill the form in because of cut to funding over the year of austerity we should also recognise that there be still stigma attach to have to declare that you be struggle and concept around the deserve poor be as old as this building think that in the century we would be hop for something well the key question with any means test system be where do we draw the line by its very nature the big loser will be those just above the cut off point in my constituency around people will miss out the uk have long stand problem such as poor housing that be difficult to keep warm one of the low pension in europe rise energy cost and annual cold relate winter death among old people could go on but be run out of time urge the government to think seriously about delay this proposal and in its place put forward pensioner taskforce to look at how we can tackle pensioner poverty in the uk stand to speak on behalf of my pensioner who will be affect by this measure before do so commend the hon member for york central rachael maskell on really impassione speech know it be not easy to stand against one own party but today decision be choice between right and wrong member be defend the choice by the government and the chancellor to make this decision on the back of pensioner who have the sheer brass neck to go out and defend it allege black hole when they have pay billion to union without any saving in return there be gb energy shell company for billion and climate promise of more than billion and then they say that there be no money and they be go to get billion on the back of pensioner will the hon member give way will not because be sure the hon lady can participate later the government might be fool themselves but they be not fool the british public or my pensioner if they want to do the right thing they should follow the example of the hon member for york central if there be issue be sure that even the opposition will look into they in depth and we will do the right thing but the government be use our pensioner as some sort of political tool to make an ideological point the chancellor stand up and find this alleged black hole to try to justify that it be horrible situation rise will not give way as will make some progress in the limited time have many opposition members be absolutely enraged that this be happen the labour party talk about transparency yet there have be no full impact assessment of the measure where be it if the government have nothing to be afraid of where be the impact assessment why do they not wait until the budget the big fiscal moment rise have already say that will not give way there could have be adequate scrutiny so that the house could analyse it and see the impact some people be at risk of death that be not my number that be what the labour party say in that be what labour member be vote for if they allow this measure to pass they must do the right thing and not use our pensioner as political weapon for their own ideology this be horrible situation to put they in the anxiety that member be cause be outrageous the government really must step up their game if they be to convince the british public that this be the right thing to do when an issue such as this have be so heavily whip it be very difficult have not the eloquence to persuade people to vote another way to be honest just want to make this as personal statement so that my constituent know why be vote the way that will today agree with the government on so many point on this issue first this be the most toxic inheritance that any government have ever have do report last september that say that between and now we have lose billion not billion on the billion black hole we sit here and listen to government make commitment that they know they would never have to fulfil because they know they be go out of power agree with the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer that we must ensure financial stability and that our income match our expenditure agree with the prime minister on the principle and always have that any burden should be place on those with the broad shoulder this be where disagree the heavy burden be not be place on those with the broad shoulder but on some of the poor large number of my constituent do not claim pension credit and will be out there like everyone else try to persuade they to apply but lot of my voluntary organisation have be savage by tory council we do not even have the advice mechanism leave think that at well we can get to or maybe but one in four will not be able to claim that benefit have large number of people who for example work at the airport and get little pension at the end and they will be tip into not qualify they be live in accommodation that those on the opposition benches provide which be squalor to be frank they be live in not insulate freeze accommodation they be the one at risk as the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson say of go to hospital and not even survive we be in an unnecessary position because there be so much else we could do we do not need to put the burden on the poor we need to make sure that those who can afford it pay that mean redistributive tax measure equalise capital gain tax tackle the corporate tax relief issue that we must confront and make sure that the city pay its way in financial transaction we do not have to be here hope that people learn the lesson as we move towards this budget not to put we on this position again where we take decision base on believe misjudgment it certainly fly against everything believe in as labour mp about tackle inequality and poverty in our society be not elect to impoverish my constituent and put they in this hardship regret vote for motion put forward by these character in the opposition but will have to because there be no other mechanism want to look at my people back in hayes in the face and say that do the right thing this have be really important debate about serious issue with many heartfelt contribution my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier the new chair of the treasury committee forensically set out the delayed and defer decision by the former government that have put such pressure on the public finance my hon friend the member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams rightly speak about pensioner child and disabled people in poverty and the need to do much more to support they the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain talk about the crucial issue of pension credit uptake and what we will do differently will say more about that later but reassure she that the treasury be fully behind the action that we be take my hon friend the member for shipley anna dixon who have huge experience in health and social care talk about the need to work with those in support accommodation housing association and the nhs to ensure that pensioner get the help that they be entitle to will spell out some of that action my hon friend the member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae make strong case for target help to the poor pensioner and the need to tackle the root cause of poverty include insulate home and bring down energy cost my hon friend the member for poole neil duncan jordan mention among many thing the very long and complicated pension credit form which have ask the department to reduce to make it as simple as possible would like to start by set out why we have take the difficult decision to mean test winter fuel payment so that they be no long available to all pensioner whatever their income but be focus on those in the great need put simply it be because we must fix the foundation of our economy as the first step to rebuild britain and make the change that our country desperately need and because when money be tight our priority must be to target resource at those who need they the most opposition member do not want to be remind of their record and the state they leave the country in but their economic failure and reckless decision leave billion hole in the public finance this year with billion overspend on the asylum system billion overspend on the transport budget and new road hospital and train station announce but not budget for there be one unfunded commitment after another and the reserve be spend three time over spending like there be no tomorrow with no thought for the consequence today that be before we even begin to deal with the challenge we already know about nhs waiting list at million more than million wait for council home totally break prison system and more than million child grow up poor opposition member want to deny that be the case but the office for budget responsibility be crystal clear it be make aware of the true extent of the pressure on the public finance only after we be elect pressure it say constitute one of the large overspends outside the pandemic face with that reality and the need to get the public finance on track this year we take the difficult decision to focus winter fuel payment on those in great need be grateful to the secretary of state for give way pension credit uptake be clearly critically important from discussion have have in my constituency know there be some myth around pension credit eligibility will the secretary of state please confirm the effort she be make on pension credit uptake and do she agree with that it be vital we ensure everyone who be eligible for pension credit receive it my hon friend be absolutely right would make that point in response to the faux outrage of conservative members who leave pensioner the very poor not get the pension credit they be entitle to urge all hon member to work with we that their local council to ensure pensioner get the money to which they be entitle as my right hon friend the chancellor and the prime minister have say this be not decision we want or expect to make but when we promise we would be responsible with taxpayer money we mean it because we know what happen when conservative member play fast and loose with the public finance work people and pensioner on fix income pay the price with soar interest rate mortgage and inflation rise will give way to the former chair of the treasury committee thank the secretary of state will she confirm from the dispatch box that if every pensioner who be eligible for pension credit take it up the cost to the exchequer will actually be substantially more than the saving from ax the winter fuel payment be that the reason why conservative members never take the action need to increase pension credit uptake we take different approach all the saving the chancellor have announce take into account the increase uptake that we want and intend to achieve when money be so tight it can not be right that all pensioner include some of the wealthy pensioner receive payment worth to year regardless of their income thank the right hon lady for give way and allow the opportunity at this late stage of the debate to speak on behalf of the people of northern ireland not in our name secretary of state this be political choice irrespective of the debate back and forth between the labour government and the conservative opposition it be not for we it be not right and this measure be measure of shame know the right hon gentleman will care about the increase in uptake in pension credit that we need and that he will also care about those just above the threshold which will turn to later on that be really important issue and will address it head on but first want to spell out the principle underlie the approach we have take which be the most help go to those who need it most and significant support for all pensioner through the pension triple lock back by extra help available for those on low income pension credit go to million of the poor pensioner and be worth on average year will the secretary of state give way will not but the truth we have to confront come into office be that up to of the very poor pensioner be not even claim the pension credit that they be entitle to that be national scandal and we be determined to make that change the previous government do nothing to tackle this issue properly indeed in they promise to merge housing benefit and pension credit which we know would significantly increase uptake yet when arrive in the department learn it would not happen until decision that be take on their watch that be completely unacceptable and unlike the conservatives we will change it thank the secretary of state for give way and welcome the increase measure to target the who because of the action of conservative members when they be in government for year have not receive pensioner credit there be people who have legitimate concern about the low level of the threshold hard work people who have tiny pension pot what mitigate measure will the secretary of state put in place will come on to extra help for those just above the threshold in moment but want to spell out what we be do on pension credit we have do more to increase pension credit uptake in the last two month than conservative members do in year we have write to all local authority to ask they to identify eligible pensioner include by share datum we be join force with age uk and citizens advice to ensure pensioner check and apply we launch major awareness campaign to continue right up to the deadline to apply on december and yes pension credit will be backdate by three month back by extra staff to ensure claim be process as quickly as possible the deputy prime minister my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner be work with housing association and support accommodation provider so that their resident know what they be entitle to be work with the secretary of state for health and social care my right hon friend the member for ilford north wes streeting to ensure that frontline nhs staff can signpost old patient who may be housebound because of disability and chronic condition for the very first time we be write to all pensioner on housing benefit who be potentially eligible to encourage they to claim something the conservatives never do in the long term because the only way to guarantee uptake be to make the whole process more automated we will bring forward the merger of housing benefit and pension credit which conservative members never do that be the extra help for the poor that we be determined to deliver but it be build on bedrock of support for all pensioner through our commitment to the pension triple lock which have see the new state pension increase by this year and the year before our continued commitment to the triple lock mean that the new state pension be forecast to increase by furth over the course of this parliament include if today office for national statistics figure be confirm next month an extra from next april when gordon brown introduce pension credit and lift million pensioner out of poverty in the tooth of the opposition of the conservative party let we remind they conservative members oppose pension credit he also introduce saving credit saving credit be specifically target at pensioner who save for old age with small saving pot and second pension what happen in the conservative party scrap it do my right hon friend not agree with that we should not listen to the crocodile tear of those in the conservative party could not have put it well myself there be faux outrage from conservative members about those just above the pension credit threshold when it be their former tory chancellor george osborne who take red pen to it mean its value decrease create some of the problem we be now have to deal with there be much more we be do to help low income pensioner include those just above pension credit the warm home discount the household support fund which we have just extend with million of additional funding that council can use to help low income pensioner our warm home plan to tackle the root cause of fuel poverty and the fact that because the only way to really control energy bill be through cheap home grow energy we have already legislate for great british energy that be the difference labour government make fix the foundation take the long term decision our country need prioritise help for those who need it most help all pensioner with the pension triple lock and provide more help for low income pensioner too we will not shy away from our responsibility as member now on the opposition benches do we be elect on platform to deliver economic stability rebuild the country and make the change that our country need make it well and give it its future back pensioner deserve well than the faux outrage of opposition members question put shockat adam jim allister gideon amos lee anderson stuart anderson

christian wakeford anna mcmorrin the house divide ayes noes question accordingly negative business of the house today order that at this day sit notwithstanding subparagraph and ii of standing order no arrangement of public business the business in the name of the leader of the opposition relate to winter fuel payment may be enter upon at any hour and may be proceed with though oppose for three hour proceeding shall then lapse if not previously dispose of and standing order no defer division shall not powell opposition day allotted day first day winter fuel payment pm beg to move that this house regret that the government approve the use of the urgency exemption in section of the social security administration act to make and lay the social fund winter fuel payment regulations before the secretary of state have refer the regulations to the social security advisory committee far regret that the government decide it be not necessary to publish an impact assessment for the regulations despite for example the evidence which show that live in cold home increase the risk of serious illness for vulnerable people and those with disability and so restrict eligibility for the winter fuel payment be likely to lead to increase burden on the national health service regret that the government make time to debate the prayer motion from the official opposition without the social security advisory committee report and government response and call on the government to lay those paper before parliament without delay and to publish full regulatory and equality impact assessment for these regulations the decision to remove winter fuel payment have come as complete shock to million of pensioner pensioner on as little as year we have have no adequate explanation as to why this measure be so urgent we have have no explanation as to why the government have to invoke the special emergency provision that allow they to bypass the scrutiny of the social security advisory committee we have have no explanation as to why no impact assessment be provide this be major policy change that will remove the entitlement for up to million pensioner include many who be already in poverty it be cut worth billion over the course of this parliament rush such policy through without take time to consider the impact ensure effective and fair implementation and allow possible scrutiny be impossible to justify this be not the way to make good policy and this be not good government it be worth consider the conclusion of one of the few body that have be afford the opportunity to scrutinise these regulation the secondary legislation scrutiny committee in the lords have be damn in its criticism of the government approach and refer the house to my remark in the previous debate when quote the committee at some length as the committee point out such measure would normally be subject to the ssac consideration that be an important part of the process for any legislation of this nature as know well from my time as work and pensions secretary conveniently ministers have claim that the measure be too urgent to wait for the ssac scrutiny we understand that the ssac be due to consider the measure tomorrow can the minister commit to the house today that the ssac report and the government statement respond to any recommendation will be lay before parliament before the regulation come into force next week as the lords committee have point out it would seem wholly inappropriate for the ssac view to be take into account only once the regulation be already in force in the word of the committee it remain unclear what the practical impact of any statement might be on regulation which will have already come into effect if the government do not intend to provide we with the ssac observation before the house rise on thursday why be member ask to consider and vote on the prayer motion against the regulation today before the ssac have meet the lack of any impact assessment mean that we be severely hamper in our ability to scrutinise this measure we be tell in the explanatory memorandum that full impact assessment have not be prepare for this instrument because there be no significant new impact on business charity or voluntary body this seem bold claim to make about measure that remove hundred of pound of support from some of the most vulnerable elderly household in our country the guidance from the national institute for health and care excellence be clear for vulnerable person live in cold home increase their chance of serious illness or death it also note that be housebound increase both the exposure to an underheated home and the cost of heat it so can ask the minister on what basis it be conclude that there would be no significant impact from this policy on those charity and organisation that support elderly people or on the wide health and social care system will he now commit to the publication of proper impact assessment the only basis for the urgency seem to be claim that this measure be vital for public finance we have even be subject to the leader of the house claim that it be need to avoid run on the pound might ask the minister to comment on that when he appear at the dispatch box the only real relevance of measure of this kind to the public finance be its impact on the government fiscal rule those fiscal rule be base on level of debt and borrowing at the end of the office for budget responsibility fiscal forecast period in five year time the rule that the chancellor have claim she will sign up to be already be meet when the government come into office accord to the obr own forecast the government could have opt to bring this measure in next year with great time for scrutiny well notice for pensioner more time to drive up pension credit uptake and perhaps time to consider whether there be much well way of go about it it would still have be broken promise and we on this side of the house would still have oppose it but it would have be much well way to make policy and it would still have deliver exactly the same saving at the end of the forecast period minister will claim that they need to make immediate in year saving but that be base entirely on black hole that they have confect themselves the real reason this be be rush be pure politic the government want to rush this measure through while they can try to blame it on their predecessor in order to avoid proper scrutiny there be no need whatsoever for the haste with which this be be do do my right hon friend like find it inexplicable that the government should fail to go through the proper process when their own research suggest that thousand of people could die as result of precisely this measure that be something that the whole house should find deeply uncomfortable my right hon friend make powerful point this be very serious step that the government be take of all the step that should be properly scrutinise surely this be one of they remember when be sit on the other side of the chamber could barely breathe without the cry go out that an impact assessment should be hold it be extraordinary that on such an important measure as this affect million of the most vulnerable the labour party should be utterly silent on this issue old people die in cold home and they die particularly if they be very old do my right hon friend think that if the government be not minded to change their mind entirely they might look at those age over those people be in receipt of the high rate of winter fuel payment and paragraph of the regulation point out that there be difference between those over and those under that might be one way that the government could make this slightly less bad than it otherwise be thank my right hon friend for his intervention it have be suggest that the government be examine way of ameliorate some of the harsh effect of this policy and that might be one of the thing they consider on that particular point we can not escape the fact that whatever age people be over two third of those who be currently pensioner below the poverty line will lose their winter fuel payment under the current arrangement have the honour to represent the most remote the most sparsely populated and the cold constituency the secretary of state in respond to my hon friend the member for north east fife wendy chamberlain say early that the government would try to maximise the take up of pension credit and accept that but would they accept that sheer remoteness and sheer distance can militate against people take up this offer ask the government via the right hon gentleman to please look at this issue because it mean an awful lot to my constituent be sure that those on the government front bench will have hear the hon gentleman intervention the reality be that the government want to rush this through so that they can blame it on their predecessor and avoid proper scrutiny there be no need whatsoever for the haste with which this be be do other than to meet the political end of the labour party they be rip the plaster off and hop that the country will have forget by the time of the next general election that be at the heart of it but we will not forget we would not have be give the opportunity to debate and vote on this measure without significant pressure from the opposition and the wide public this be nothing to do with fiscal responsibility and everything to do with political expediency no scrutiny no impact assessment no notice this be an appalling way to govern this be serious topic and we know from the debate early this afternoon that it be one on which member across this house and people across this country have strong feeling we understand that this be difficult decision to have to take by mean test winter fuel payment we know that we will be end future payment to most pensioner while maintain our steadfast commitment to protect those in great need but although they do not like to be remind of it conservative members know exactly why we need to take this step because it be conservative members and indeed former member of this house who have now be vote out by the british public who do such damage to our country economy and the public finance the legacy of the last on point of order madam deputy speaker this be the second government minister we have hear from the dispatch box today yet only moment ago we see the chancellor sit on the front bench it be the chancellor who choose to spend billion on set up great british energy it be the chancellor who choose to spend billion give pay rise to their union paymaster it be the chancellor order thank the hon lady but she will be aware that that be not point of order it be more of speech that she be seek to make perhaps she will find an opportunity to contribute in the debate thank you madam deputy speaker the hon member who just intervene and indeed everyone on that side of the house might like to reflect on what the legacy of the last government truly be it be one of irresponsible overspending of uncosted commitment after uncosted commitment and of ministers run away from take difficult decision as direct consequence when we come to power we be face with billion black hole in the public finance for this year alone be genuinely grateful to the minister for give way he be minister at the treasury so be hop he will be able to outline some of the fact and answer my question he will outline today that the saving make by cut the winter fuel payment be billion if everybody accept the means testing that he be propose it would cost billion so can he outline to the house despite the bluster that he have just make about save money for the great british people how it will save money when it will cost more under his proposal thank the hon gentleman for his intervention the announce saving include an assumption of an increase take up of pension credit which be in line with the high level ever achieve frankly if more people be take up pension credit when they be eligible for it we should welcome it because it mean that support be be target at those in great need rise be go to make some progress the opposition do not like to be remind of their legacy when they be in government but let we have look shall we what do they have to show for their year of reckless overspending fail asylum system prison at break point more than million people wait for council home million child grow up in poverty and more than million people on nhs waiting list this government and every member of this house who stand on my party manifesto be elect to turn thing around yesterday in the other place the transport minister cast doubt on the continuation of travel concession for pensioner which have cause significant alarm in my constituency and other notwithstanding the discussion we be have today could the minister reassure we that travel concession for pensioner will continue under labour government thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention the chancellor will take all decision in the budget on october interruption let make one important point to he as we approach the budget on october we know there be go to be difficult decision that we have to take in the budget and frankly that be direct consequence of the decision take by he and his colleague when they be in government as he be treasury minister wonder whether he could help with this question how many of the pensioner who will lose the winter fuel allowance today receive less than the average train driver the government have just give pay rise to understand the political point that the hon lady be try to make but let be clear if she be talk about pensioner the foundation of state support for pensioner be the state pension which be why the government have commit to maintain the triple lock for the duration of this parliament rise be go to make some progress the triple lock mean that pensioner be receive more this year figure release this morning indicate that they may get well over more next year over the course of this parliament they will get more under the state pension that be the foundation of state support for pensioner rise be go to make some progress we have see clearly how conservative member do not like to be remind of their legacy in government of the mess in which they leave the economy our public service and the rest of our country after their year in office this government and every labour member be elect to turn thing around rise be go to make some progress we be under no illusion we know it will be slow and difficult process when the damage go so deep but we be determined to fix the foundation of our country so that on the bedrock of financial stability and fiscal responsibility we can get our economy grow after year under the conservatives thank the minister for give way on the point about fiscal responsibility be not sure of the morality of try to balance this country fiscal book on the back of pensioner he reference the manifesto on which the labour party stand at the election no austerity under labour be say in scotland so what should the scottish labour mp do in this vote should they bow down to the chancellor or should they stand up for their scottish constituent every labour member be elect on promise to restore economic stability and fiscal responsibility to our country and it be on that basis that we will get the economy grow to make people across the country well off and to put our public service on sustainable footing remind the hon gentleman that winter heating assistance be devolved matter in scotland the scottish government intend to legislate to introduce means test payment this winter which be equivalent to the winter fuel payment in england and wales rise have take several intervention so will make some progress the point of this debate be to focus on why we have to take difficult economic decision even if they risk we be unpopular we know that the universal application of winter fuel payment be already recognise as unfair in the face of our dire economic inheritance it be simply unsustainable we should be clear that when the winter fuel payment be introduce in high percentage of pensioner than people of working age be in poverty that be no long the case put simply there be now pensioner receive winter fuel payment who do not need they and that be reality we can not afford let put it in financial term over quarter of pensioner have wealth of more than million half have wealth of over and fifth of pensioner household have gross income equivalent to year that be why it be right to mean test winter fuel payment pensioner in my constituency will be sadden by the way the minister be caricature pensioner as wealthy and not in need of this winter fuel support age uk have say that in the gosport constituency alone pensioner stand to lose their winter fuel payment these be not wealthy people they be people who in many case be just outside the pension credit limit and be hang on by their fingertip do he agree that caricature they as wealthy and not in need be unbelievably insulting think the hon lady unintentionally misunderstood my point will put the question back to she do she feel that pensioner who have wealth of over million or who earn more than year should get the winter fuel payment in the context of the financial circumstance the argument we be make be that give the dire economic situation we face and give our dire inheritance we should mean test the winter fuel payment rise will make some progress because it be important to explain why we be choose to mean test the winter fuel payment mean testing will allow we to make sure that those in the great need still receive the help they need we will make sure that all pensioner continue to benefit from the triple lock and we will start to deal with the shocking state of the public finance that we have inherit rise be go to make some progress as have take many intervention already under our approach those eligible for pension credit will continue to receive winter fuel payment we want to target winter fuel payment to those on the low income which be why we be link the payment to eligibility for pension credit and other qualifying income relate benefit and tax credit that be the right approach to help those on the low income we be determined to make it as effective as possible by make sure that people who be eligible for pension credit make claim the point make to the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for central devon mel stride be fair one distance and remoteness militate against take up people live in very remote hamlet in the highland do not necessarily perceive the department that they should can have an undertaking from the minister that the government will look at this issue thank the hon gentleman for his comment and know that my colleague be aware of this issue in fact it be one reason why the automatic payment of pension credit and other benefit be so important for instance the merging of housing benefit and pension credit would help to overcome some of the problem it would help some of the people in the situation he describe that merger of housing benefit and pension credit be first moot in and be delay several time by the previous government think they intend to leave it until my right hon friend the secretary of state for work and pensions be look at that as matter of great priority to ensure that people get the help that they deserve rise be go to make some progress the important point to focus on in this debate be make sure that everyone eligible for pension credit take up that offer not only so they receive the benefit of pension credit but so that we can well target the winter fuel payment give the financial inheritance that we have we estimate that pensioner be miss out on pension credit to which they be entitle and frankly the conservatives fail to act on that for year that be why it be so important that we be now conduct campaign to make sure that as many people as possible make claim our approach be already show sign of success the government have receive around pension credit claim in the five week since the announcement on july that be more than double the number in the previous five week and we will continue to do all we can to encourage pensioner who be eligible to apply for pension credit we have use wide range of medium to reach pensioner and key stakeholder and have be work with voluntary organisation such as age uk and citizens advice local authority and the devolve government to raise awareness through their network and channel the secretary of state for work and pensions be take the further unprecedented step of write to pensioner household who be in receipt of housing benefit but who be not yet claim the pension credit that they be likely to be entitle to our national pension credit campaign will run right through until the application deadline on december on february the temperature in braemar in my constituency sink to minus some pensioner there will lose their winter fuel allowance through decision take by this labour government can the minister explain to those pensioner in one of the cold constituency in the country why they have to surrender that important support at the same time as the government have find billion to give pay rise to their union paymaster would be interested to understand why the hon gentleman be back candidate to lead his party who support the means testing of the winter fuel payment he might want to have conversation with that candidate before he start criticise our approach of target support at those in great need the critical point be that the combination of the state pension rise under the triple lock with those in great need get winter fuel payment alongside pension credit not to mention the extension of the household support fund mean that the right measure be in place to give all pensioner the support they need opposition member want to know why the legislation be be progress urgently will be really clear it be urgent because we need to deal urgently with the billion black hole the huge in year spending pressure that we inherit from the government that they run it be crucial that we act quickly to restore responsibility to our public finance and stability to our economy on top of that it be important that we make sure that regulation be in place at the start of the qualifying week for winter fuel payment while waste no time in do all we can to raise pension credit take up we have hear that the transport minister yesterday could give no assurance to pensioner about their transport concession last week ask the deputy prime minister about the single person council tax discount there be very real prospect that pensioner could lose even more than another or will the exchequer secretary take this opportunity to reassure pensioner that there be no way that the government will remove the single person discount from the council tax it would be politically good for he and the labour party and it would be enormously important for people who need to hear some reassurance at this time the right hon gentleman will not be surprised to hear say that the chancellor will take all decision in the budget however he might like to reflect on the record of his party in office on encourage take up of pension credit we have be painfully aware since take office how little the conservatives do to increase take up of pension credit during their year in office that be why it be so urgent for we to make progress in get those eligible to sign up for pension credit by do so they will get pension credit which they may have be miss out on for year under the conservatives and they will continue to receive the winter fuel payment pensioner may well be angry at the conservatives for how little they do to get people to sign up for pension credit while they be in office pensioner may well be angry at the conservatives for leave the country with legacy of billion black hole in the public finance we on the government benches be commit to protect the triple lock that will mean that pensioner on the full new state pension who have receive an extra this year will pende the uprating review by the secretary of state for work and pensions this autumn receive boost that could be worth well more than so by the end of this parliament they could be receive around more than they do today conservative members be keen to play politic with the tough decision that this government be take they be desperate to take attention away from the fact that as people across this country know it be the conservatives who be to blame for the economic mess we have gain they create mess and now they want to criticise we for clean it up if they have govern more responsibly they might not have be sit on the opposition benches in opposition to government who be fix the foundation they leave to rot do the minister agree that the only shameful thing in this debate be the legacy that the government be leave it force the new the reality that pensioner be not receive pension credit be shameful legacy if conservative members want to show humility and learn from their party record in government they would acknowledge that they be the one who crash the economy leave the nhs in way that pensioner can not get to see doctor and break nhs dentistry do the minister agree that it be our job to fix the economy so that we can keep on help pensioner my hon friend be absolutely right frankly it be time for conservative members to recognise and accept what they have do to this country and to show some contrition and accept responsibility however no matter what the conservatives choose to do we be get on with the tough decision that be necessary in government by change the winter fuel payment and make it mean test we be begin to take the necessary step to address the black hole they create while protect the most vulnerable in society the prime minister have say that we must be prepare to be unpopular if we be to govern responsibly which mean face up to tough challenge and tackle they head on the motion lay by the opposition set out several regret but they have never once show regret for all the reckless decision they take and the damage they do to our public service public finance and economy our task now in government be to fix the mess they make and to give our country the chance of the well future we deserve call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party it be pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker liberal democrats welcome the opportunity for this debate we will continue to call on the government to change course on their plan cut to winter fuel payment we know the government have inherit mess and we know that at the core of that mess be legacy of reckless economic mismanagement by the previous conservative government however that can not be allow to serve as cover for measure that cause suffer for the most vulnerable in our society early this afternoon liberal democrats support the prayer motion to annul the social fund winter fuel payment regulation strip support from many of the poor pensioner just when energy bill be set to rise again this winter be the wrong thing to do and we have table our own early day motion to reject these plan it should be note that the secondary legislation scrutiny committee in the other place have say that it be unconvinced by the reason give for the urgency attach to lay these regulations and particularly concerned that this preclude appropriate scrutiny we be supportive of this motion and particularly of the point that there should have be great scrutiny of the government decision to cut winter fuel payment it be well establish that there be strong link between live in cold home and an increase in the risk of serious illness for vulnerable people and those with disability be extremely disappointed by the lack of creativity in this government agree entirely with the hon lady that there be legacy of unfunded promise but it be not for my constituent in lagan valley to bear the burden do she agree that they do not have broad shoulder thank the hon member for her intervention and for state so passionately the case that we on the liberal democrat benches be make in this debate the government should have do far more to understand the likely consequence of restrict eligibility for the winter fuel payment and how that would translate into increase burden on the national health service and my liberal democrat colleague have listen to our constituent and hear from countless pensioner who be worried about how they will afford their energy bill this winter since these cut have be announce have be inundate with local people express their disappointment at this decision that be why the liberal democrats have table early day motion call on the government to withdraw these plan and it be why we vote in favour of the prayer motion early today we believe that it be simply wrong to remove winter fuel payment from million of struggle pensioner recognise the comment that the hon member have make about the economic inheritance but do she not agree that compare with the situation that we manage in coalition with the liberal democrats in the labour government be in well position they have unemployment low than we inherit employment high than we inherit the deficit lower than we inherit and economic growth fast than we inherit we in partnership with the liberal democrats manage to keep winter fuel payment in those circumstance do she not agree that labour should do the same thank the hon member for his intervention but it be important to reflect on the disastrous legacy of the mini budget and the circumstance that many people continue to struggle with thank to high interest rate on their mortgage payment certainly from the perspective of my constituent that cast much long shadow which the winter fuel payment cut will do nothing to ameliorate last week ask the chancellor if she would give her full support to measure to boost the uptake of pension credit welcome her commitment to work with the secretary of state for work and pensions to maximise the take up of pension credit by bring forward the administration of housing benefit and pension credit we have speak lot about the take up of pension credit in this debate already but it be important to say that pensioner think that be what the minister say be still not take it up those people will by definition be hard to reach and the most vulnerable do not understand how the government can in good conscience take away this guarantee benefit at time where there be no certainty whatsoever about their be able to get the other people sign up to pension credit in time welcome my hon friend intervention he make an important point although would say that welcome the chancellor commitment last week to work with old people charity and local authority to raise awareness of pension credit none the less he be exactly right that many people will have this benefit take away without know that there be pension credit for which they be eligible and should claim as the lords secondary legislation scrutiny committee have highlight the dwp have assume that the uptake of pension credit will increase by just five percentage point and that will still exclude around pensioner have the government make proper assessment of what the impact will be if uptake of pension credit increase by more than that amount continue to call for assurance that the government will ensure that all those eligible for pension credit claim both the benefit itself and the winter fuel payment we will be vote against the scrapping of this stream of support for pensioner although we recognise that the government face difficult choice give the appalling mess leave by the conservative party the liberal democrats will continue to advocate for the necessity of winter fuel payment the mismanagement of our economy by the outgoing conservative government have leave formidable challenge and we understand that undo that damage will not be easy whatever fiscal pressure be be address here today we have hear about the additional death that could possibly result from this measure do the hon member share my disgust at some member celebrate the result of the previous vote as if it be football match thank the hon member for his intervention be afraid that can not comment because do not see that but thank he for raise it it be not right for the consequence of the decision of the outgoing conservative government and this burden to be carry by some of the most vulnerable in our society those with the broad shoulder should carry heavy burden liberal democrats have set out detailed proposal to tackle fuel poverty and we be call on the government to look at they very seriously that include step such as launch an emergency home energy upgrade programme with free insulation and heat pump for low income household introduce social tariff for the most vulnerable to provide target energy discount for vulnerable household and implement proper windfall tax on the super profit of oil and gas producer and trader to raise vital revenue we have also call on the government to tackle the wide cost of living crisis include by invest an extra billion year in our farmer to bring down food price increase the carer allowance and expand it to more carer and remove the two child limit and the benefit cap more than million pensioner be currently live in poverty they have have tremendously difficult time during the cost of living crisis deal with record high energy bill and eye water food cost that be why the liberal democrats be proud to have introduce the triple lock when we be in government lift countless vulnerable pensioner out of poverty and why we be strongly committed to ensure it remain in place pensioner deserve to have the support and the security of know that the triple lock will be there in the long term we acknowledge the dire economic situation the new government have inherit yet we have hear warning call from sector representative include age uk disability rights uk and many pensioner themselves regard the damage that this cut might cause as the government try to clear up the conservative party mess they must ensure that that do not come at the expense of pensioner and family who will struggle to heat their home this winter on point of order madam deputy speaker you will know the rule far well than but this be really important debate and just want to ensure that the house be quorate can you tell how many people have to be on the government benches for debate there be few than labour mp who have decide to find this worthwhile debate to come to and want to make sure we have enough people here for this debate because it be really serious as the hon gentleman will know the house be not count and the matter of quorum be not relevant consideration at this time and therefore we shall move on be proud to be elect on manifesto that commit to deliver economic stability security and growth after year of tory recklessness with our economy and after the disastrous liz truss mini budget drive up inflation food bill and mortgage repayment and push my constituent to the brink the public vote for change that change must start with get our economy back on its foot when the previous labour government leave office trussell trust food bank be give out food parcel year last year they give out million when we on the labour side of the house talk about the recklessness of the previous government it be not academic we be talk about taxpayer money be pour into ideological gimmick while child be go to school hungry work adult be one rent rise away from homelessness and broken nhs be stall productivity and fail those who most rely on public service include our pensioner we face billion black hole in the public finance that they cover up and walk away from stability mean bring the economy and the country back from the brink to which the conservative party knowingly push it no one doubt that this policy be tough and it be not measure we want to take but we have be leave huge bill to pay means test the winter fuel allowance will allow we to support those pensioner most in need as we take the difficult step we have to take to right the ship member across this house know that in our community there be too many pensioner struggle that be why welcome this government commitment to the triple lock under which the state pension have rise by this year and will rise by more than in april also support the extension of the warm home discount worth for more than million low wage pensioner the hon gentleman will be aware that the tory triple lock be introduce by the tories precisely in order to deal with the legacy leave by the previous labour government when unless have get this number wrong there be low take up of pension credit than there be today we raise that the triple lock raise pensioner income and the first act of the labour government of whom he be clearly aim to be loyal member be to take away from people who really need it three million food parcel be distribute last year that be the legacy of the conservative government and the triple lock that the conservatives purport to defend they break it in also support the extension of the household support fund to help the family most in need this winter as well as the government commitment to introduce tough regulation to the energy market which have let customer down for too long be work hard with bracknell forest council to ensure that pensioner in the bracknell constituency who be in need but not claim the support to which they be entitle be identify and encourage to get help urge any pensioner who be concerned about their finance to go to age uk benefit calculator to see what support they may be entitle to what do the hon gentleman say to pensioner during the election campaign say that the labour party would restore the broken economy inherit from the conservative party in the long term there be only one permanent solution to end fuel poverty we must end our dependence on volatile foreign energy market and deliver last energy security the conservative party fail to do that in government leave energy bill high for every household include those most in need that be why this government plan to create gb energy new national energy company be vital it will bring energy supply back into the hand of the british public and help to get price back under control that be the long term solution to fuel poverty home grow british control power roughly people in the hon gentleman bracknell constituency will not get the winter fuel allowance this year as result of the change that he have just vote for how many of they do he estimate will struggle to pay their bill have already set out the support that want to see as well as the support that the government have put in place to help pensioner in my constituency and to bring energy bill down in the long term which will help all household in bracknell and across the country that be really important first step on the road to growth because of the triple lock grow economy mean grow pension and grow support for pensioner in need future prosperity do not fall out of the sky we have to create the condition for it and those condition be sensible spending bring debt under control and encourage investment to do those thing we must dig ourselves out of this financial hole and that mean tough choice this policy be difficult step step that do not want to take but it be step away from the brink towards stability security and growth that be why back it rise order have no choice but to put three minute limit on back bench speech before hand over to the next speaker which be very sorry to do member will be aware that more than of you wish to take part call priti patel who would have think that one of the first act of this awful cruel and ideological labour government would be to assault the nation pensioner by remove winter fuel payment let we be candid the nation pensioner be fall victim to an ideological decision betrayal by labour as it succumb to shovel gross amount of public spending into the pocket of many of its union paymaster it be quite no have time limit the hon member have already speak it be interesting that there have be so little transparency around finance and the fiscal choice that the government have choose to make there have be no impact assessment no honesty around the cost of all this to the exchequer in the long run and nothing about the administration of the household support fund how have labour ministers make the spurious claim that they have have no choice in this decision bear in mind that the government so desperate be they to justify this brutal cut claim couple of week ago that there would be run on the pound without the decision which be just extraordinary and speak to their fiscal ineptitude have series of question on the mitigation first it be right to encourage more pensioner to take up pension credit where they be entitle to it know from my time at the department for work and pensions that many on the conservative benches have spend year encourage pensioner to take up pension credit we should know how the targeting will work and what the cost will be secondly in recent day the government have be spin yet again that those affect by the loss of the winter fuel payment will benefit from an estimate rise in the state pension will the minister confirm what the net real term impact will be on overall household income for those who be lose the benefit and will he confirm how it will add up over time and what the actual cost will be thirdly concern have be raise throughout the day that if pensioner can not afford to heat their home there will be serious impact on health we do not have an impact assessment so can we have some honesty now what be the cost to the nhs the government owe it to the british people to be honest about this we have hear that the household support fund will be extend but how exactly will that million be fund who will pay for it finally there be so many unanswered question the government must be honest and answer they there have be lack of transparency with no impact assessment whatsoever it be right that we hold the government to account and that they be honest with british pensioner about their intention even on the future of the triple lock be glad that we be have this debate perhaps the opposition and part of the medium be bore face something that they have not see for year government benches pack full of member represent all part of the united kingdom who respect each other and support the government because they have stoke frenzy that fear be at risk of obscure the most important argument for the change that we be debate yes there be the economic argument which matter as the office for budget responsibility and institute for fiscal studies have recognise this government inherit public finance in shocking state in one of the large in year overspend outside of the pandemic in history or as one member put it early an accounting error unlike the rapid succession of conservative chancellors our chancellor have level with the british people and be transparent about the nation finance restore stability mean hard choice this be not the first and it will not be the last however it be not the economic case that wish to emphasise today but the principled one let make general point about the argument we make in politic sometimes we politician can be too quick to hold up our hand and say that we have no choice the lawyer require this or the economist require that that can leave voter frustrate why vote if the people we vote for be not in charge but lawyer or economist be can the people we elect not control the thing that affect our life to restore trust in politic we must show that politic matter that be why it be important that we articulate what we do in term of principle and choice to govern be to choose target winter fuel payment be choice however difficult and necessary it be the right choice for two principle reason the first be about the moral purpose of the policy gordon brown design the winter fuel payment to ensure that nobody be at home cold because they could not afford to turn on their heating it be time when state pension rise be miserly and as many find insufficient to heat their home but let note that pensioner be well off after the last labour government one million be lift out of poverty by the change we be debate today do not move from that position in time when the state pension have rise by and will rise again by as much as the change target the winter fuel payment base on the principle of need that be the right principle let be clear do not believe that taxpayer order there be three minute time limit my wife suzy be over retirement age she be also in full time employment be over retirement age be also in full time employment and high rate taxpayer have always believe that the winter fuel allowance should be mean test because while we give it to charity there be other perhaps young people such as the young and disabled who can not run around and keep warm who could use the money have believe that for probably as long as the now chancellor of the exchequer have believe it let we be clear this have nothing to do with black hole in the economy which laura kuenssberg identify while interview the prime minister on sunday as be largely contribute to by inflationary pay increase for the union for railway worker and junior doctor this be policy dream up in by the present chancellor of the exchequer that be on the record it be policy make in no downing street and endorse by the nation undertaker in no it be cruel it be heartless and it be go to lead to death this winter so while believe that there should be means test the manner in which the government be go about it be profoundly wrong and deeply flawed and will cause untold of hardship it have get to change my right hon friend be give moving and compassionate speech will he tell we where specifically the responsibility for this cruel policy lie be grateful for my hon friend question because it do not lie with the hon member for ealing north james murray it lie with the chancellor of the exchequer and with the prime minister both of whom should be on the government front bench this afternoon but neither of whom have be present during the debate although the chancellor do come in to vote and then nip out again that in itself be shameful abhor the fact that there be politician sit on the labour benches who be quite prepared to fight to the last drop of somebody else political blood because that be what be happen this afternoon you say that our chancellor and the prime minister be not here on the government benches but where be your leader and your shadow chancellor they be not here either you talk about means testing be right we have difficult financial situation and difficult decision that we have to take so the right hon gentleman seem to agree with we on that order appreciate that passion be run high this afternoon and that there be many new member in the house but when we use you and your we be refer to the chair there be good reason for why we direct debate through the chair please can member remember that thank you madam deputy speaker stand chastised the leader of the opposition be in the chamber early this afternoon but see no sign whatsoever of the prime minister however the answer to the hon lady remain the same the responsibility for this policy lie directly with the chancellor of the exchequer and the prime minister and they be go to live to regret it the right hon gentleman have express the principle that mean testing could be accommodate do he agree that many of those who have write to we as members of parliament also sympathise with the principle that mean testing could and should come in at some point in the future the manner in which this proposal be be bring in before the pensioner who be eligible for pension credit be register for it be the problem that particularly affect the pensioner in taunton and wellington be grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention have make the point and will make it again that have no quarrel with the principle have huge quarrel with the manner in which this policy be be implement because it be cruel and heartless it be go to leave thousand if not million of pensioner literally out or more probably in in the cold this winter and some of they will die as result it be not necessary it do not have to be do and it will not save money so there have to be rethink just to conclude detect degree of arrogance on the government benches this afternoon the fact that there be only about member on those benches speak volume to those outside who think that member be go to come and hear this matter be seriously debate there seem to be belief that the next election be five year away the next general election may be five year away but the next election be next may and those vote in the county council election in may those pensioner and their family will not forget this have not write speech have write down few point because like many colleague have spend the past week agonise over how to vote today in the end decide to vote with my conscience which mean that vote with the government interruption conservative members laugh but will tell they why today listen sincerely to contribution from conservative members and this be what have learn first there be several intervention in which they criticise the government effort to improve the take up of pension credit interruption well they do member can go and read hansard if they want to dispute that there have be several criticism of that almost to the point that when they talk about who be vulnerable wonder whether they have blind spot for some of our most vulnerable constituent secondly have learn about conservative members disdain for hard work people because we have learn that in their spending plan they intend to reject the pay recommendation of their own pay body do the hon member appreciate that some of the hard work people be the pensioner we be now stand up for and who we be try to stop freeze in the winter to come and those ahead absolutely do and members may recall that come to this house last week and ask the chancellor question about my own constituent represent the snowiest and cold constituency in england and have have deep concern about those pensioner however have study the detail and listen to pensioner in my constituency in the last week alone it have turn out that several people who have come forward to express concern about this policy be people who could be claim pension credit but be not want to make broad point about the winter fuel allowance the winter fuel allowance be introduce under the last labour government in when the state pension be year if that have increase at the rate of inflation today it would be year thankfully it be more than twice that hon member because of we conservative members say that it be because of they but again they may want to look at the record in fact under both the previous labour government and the previous conservative government the state pension increase at above the rate of inflation and absolutely welcome that the winter fuel allowance however have not increase for year so the winter fuel allowance in real term have become less and less year after year the point be make be that we need to consider our people if the conservatives argument be that after year in government people on the full state pension be away from death and destitution what have they be do for year we need new settlement for the economy and this government be actually answer the concern of my constituent who live in cold stone build badly insulate home and who lose out when the previous government choose to cut the funding available to insulate home this government be set up great british energy which will help to cut bill over the long term people be poor and struggle to pay their bill not because we do not give away enough taxpayer money in small pocket of benefit here and there what we need be high wage and well pension and have be convince by the chancellor argument that under this government the pension will rise at or above the rate of inflation year on year while energy bill will fall finally my constituent would not thank if do not take step to stabilise the economy because we need to get nhs waiting list down and we need order it be interesting to follow the hon member for bishop auckland sam rushworth and to follow the angst ride journey with his conscience to ensure that he could abandon those in most need of their winter fuel allowance in this come winter it be good of he to highlight the tory triple lock which do take the absolutely woeful state of the pension leave by the last labour government and transform it into sounder one today however even in these condition where thank to the tories pensioner be much well off than they use to be there be people and this come from labour research few year ago who will die accord to that research if this policy which he in good conscience think he should vote for today be implement that be the truth that take we to one key issue that we have be discuss today which be process the hon member for bishop auckland seem like an honourable and decent man at least he use the word conscience in this debate rather than purely political theatre the point be that when something could lead to thousand of people die the government have not do what they be legally oblige to do they use some rare exemption requirement and produce an impact assessment so we do not know people who in good conscience want to do the right thing like the hon gentleman do not know what the impact be if it be in front of we and if it validate the labour party previous analysis and show that people could be go to die could he really support the measure in good conscience for billion when we spend more than billion the billion black hole be sort of political theatre from government who say they be not go to do politic as theatre and performance and that they be go to do it properly in fact this be miniscule amount it be significant but it be miniscule in the overall scheme of thing choice have be make and ram through on timetable that be not in order and do not follow the normal and proper way of thing or allow new member of parliament like the hon gentleman to look at the issue weigh it up and come to the right conclusion it be truly shameful peter one of my constituent be one of people who sign petition in my constituency against this measure he and his wife be over the pension credit limit the right hon gentleman be cite concern about the safety of vulnerable group and wonder if he might reflect on the past year and that he enable government that lead to the decay and decline of every single public service when public service decay and decline that disproportionately affect vulnerable group the hon gentleman know full well that that be not true use to chair the education committee so know little about that and standard be look at the oecd or the pisa table it seem that the new ministers do not want to take into account the most reputable international measure of educational performance which show that we lift ourselves up massively the nhs be under enormous tension and in crisis but compare with five year ago we have more doctor and nurse if it be purely budgetary matter wish the new government well in reform the nhs but if we want to see what labour government mean for the health service we can find it right now we just need to travel to wales and the hon gentleman know that that be not deliver let return to peter and his wife they be not the only people who be worried about this policy spend little time yesterday read labour manifesto as hope labour members may have do and be touch by the quote from gary on page ve never struggle this much to keep warm can only afford to heat one room with small portable heater sometimes sleep in my armchair to save money it no way to live surely labour members in good conscience recognise that he be right it be no way to live when million people vote labour they vote for it on the promise of change do not think this be the change that gary and other be lead to believe they would receive be glad that the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart refer to the change in the labour manifesto at the last election because the first line of that manifesto be the promise to bring economic stability to britain and that would be change from the previous government we know that bring economic stability would involve tough choice but even at the election we have no idea of the scale of the mess we would find means test the winter fuel allowance be not an easy decision but we must look at it in the broad context let make three point about the situation that pensioner face first the pension triple lock be critical piece of public policy which make the state pension genuinely liveable the triple lock mean that pension increase by in this year alone and the state pension will increase by over over the course of this parliament that help all pensioner it be absolutely the right decision for the government to prioritise the pension triple lock even if that mean means test the winter fuel allowance secondly the poor pensioner will still get the winter fuel allowance be reassure by the push to increase the take up of pension credit rise sorry will not give way must make progress thirdly we must look more broadly at all the challenge that old people face waiting list be appallingly long old people in my constituency can wait month for hip replacement other spend their life saving on private healthcare understand that people be concern but we do people no favour by pretend that tough choice do not exist delay that decision only lead to tough less enviable choice ahead rise let make progress if the house want to understand tough choice look no far than my home of scotland despite have high public spending and high taxis than the rest of the uk our pensioner face the long waiting list on record today the snp will oppose means test the winter fuel allowance in westminster while bring in its means testing in scotland that be not to clean up the mess that the tories leave they but to clean up their own mismanagement of scottish finance we can do well in take this step we must recognise that the country have change since the winter fuel allowance be introduce today when look around my constituency see that age be no long the main factor in whether someone can afford to heat their home it can not be right that we continue to give the wealthy pensioner year as society change we must adjust we do today pensioner well service by target those who need help the most rise to publicly oppose this propose change understand the need to balance the book we all do and we know how it work but to be perfectly frank and it give no joy to say this never imagine ever in my life that labour government would seek to balance the book on the back of pensioner throughout the united kingdom put that on record at the beginning say it respectfully but with great grief fully comprehend that the system could do with an upgrade perhaps we should look at household cap as we have with the child benefit payment perhaps we could look at allocate per household rather than per person perhaps we could look at ensure that everyone who be still earn more than their pension through employment can have defer payment until full retirement perhaps we could look at an opt out scheme for pensioner such as do not need the money ask not to take the money give the money to charity be not well than anybody else never be well than anybody else but realise that do not need that money so give it away other might want to do the same thing it should be direct face to face application for pension credit there should not be nine week wait for the application to be process my goodness people need the money now the threshold should be raise the government and the minister have say about the that be come next spring but pensioner need the money this winter and as soon as possible in northern ireland of home rely on oil fire boiler for heating there be high level of fuel poverty with of the population currently spend more than of their household income on heat their home think about the woman who have tiny workplace pension from the hour they work while their child be in school the woman of the women against state pension inequality campaign have already be disadvantage and will pay further price for not be allow to save for their need be beg this government on behalf of my constituent in strangford not to remove the benefit from everyone in one fell swoop national energy action estimate that close to people die every winter day in the uk due to cold home this government in their wisdom and through this decision have decide to imperil many more do my hon friend agree that it be wrong it will have an impact and it will cause death right across the united kingdom my hon friend be absolutely right we all recognise that this winter will be one where pensioner will feel the gravity of this and the pain of the cold stand for all those who be make do with less than month and those pensioner who will be impact by the winter fuel allowance be take away from they for they this be lot of money it be the difference between be warm this winter or simply survive it be not an exaggeration it be life for my constituent and respectfully for the constituent of those on the government benches will conclude the clock for speech have stop will be respectful of the time as you would expect madam deputy speaker those who have work all their life deserve to be pay for what they pay in there be basic standard along with woman and child go first in the lifeboat protect those who can not survive the icy cold so let we slow down the ship look to labour to make that happen and veer away from the iceberg which some member only see the tip of at the moment which could be the destruction of the government before their first journey even begin let we correct course and get this right let we support the opposition motion which reflect the mood and opinion on the opposition benches hope that the labour party will realise that it be go the wrong way we be try to direct they the right way be grateful to follow the hon member for strangford jim shannon have have short time in this place but already know that he often sit in the chamber and listen to everyone to member across the house listen to his point as well and will make these point to he on this issue like so many other when it come to our economic inheritance which be billion in year black hole we have to make difficult decision we can choose to ignore the situation we be in and duck those decision the well trodden path that be too often take by the last government but the price of entry to that path be not free there be cost it mean accept fail economy and fail public service it try to shift the problem again and again to future generation it be an easy path but not responsible one the alternative be that we govern as we campaign not just on economic stability but on credibility and truth in politic and be honest with people about the mess that we be in and crucially about the path that we will take to bring about bright day to lower waiting time in our nhs to get more teacher into our school and more police on our street deliver again for people across the country failure to deliver have become the norm that must change if we ignore the problem we can not fix they since record begin no government front load spending so much to leave the cupboard so bare for the second half of the year that be an easy path but not responsible one believe that opposition member know that indeed there have be call over the year from conservative and liberal democrat members to target winter fuel payment to those most in need the government be combine responsibility with compassion and know order call wendy morton madam deputy speaker the winter fuel payment give peace of mind that would be able to heat my home and stay warm during the winter not my word but those of constituent and they be typical of the many comment have receive in my inbox and those have hear when have be out and about across my constituency in my constituency there be just recipient of pension credit yet an estimate pensioner will lose out this winter this political choice because that be what it be mean that those very same pensioner those will lose up to of winter fuel payment in addition the energy price cap rise of put further financial pressure on they of about it impact pensioner earn as little as year contrast that with the inflation bust pay rise that the government have hand out contrast that with the billion that the government be spend on gb energy state run company that will not produce any energy nor will it cut their bill what be more when the vast majority of my pensioner who be wait for their annual increase of next year thank to our work when we be in government deduct for lose the winter fuel payment they will be leave with an increase equivalent to just day less than the cost of pint of milk wonder how many of my right hon friend constituent who will lose that vital payment earn less than the train driver who have have all that extra money my hon friend make an important point it come back to how this be about political choice and be here to stand up for my pensioner in my constituency also point out that it be the conservative party in government that drive up pension credit application by in just month it be important that we do not forget that pension credit take up be often an entrenched issue people in my constituency be often too proud to apply the process be too complicated page question and as we have hear nine week to determine the outcome of the application tackle pension credit take up be important but it be not the solution to the crisis that pensioner face today only week ahead of the winter they need help now accord to age uk across the uk around million pensioner who badly need the money to stay warm this winter will now not receive it lose the winter fuel payment will make it significantly hard for they to keep warm which undermine their health and wellbeing as we have hear pensioner often have serious health condition and disability often they live in old property and in the north or in my constituency in the west midland it be often cold than in other part of the country pensioner be all disproportionately affect yet there be no sign of an impact assessment just chancellor who seemingly storm ahead with her political decision will my right hon friend give way will continue because be conscious that other want to get the chance to speak there be no time for old people on low income to set aside money if they have it to help they get through the winter be at home in the cold increase the risk of raise blood pressure stroke heart attack and hypothermia do not vote for this callous cut early today will not pick the pocket of those who have work hard all their life do the right thing by their family and this country will continue to speak up for my constituent who deserve well than this this be so wrong associate myself with the comment of labour colleague in this debate but want to speak about the particular issue of public sector pay and the attempt make in this debate and the precede one to turn pensioner and public sector worker against each other include the public sector worker who have be drive to rely on food bank and payday loan who be proud to represent as trade union official the public sector worker in my constituency must wonder what the opposition have against they in this debate strong economy need strong public service but the problem for the last government and the public sector worker who work for they be that their public finance strategy rest on impose the big real wage cut in live memory those be not my word but those of the former permanent secretary to the treasury nicholas macpherson the consequence for the service that we all depend on be clear teaching vacancy have double over the past three year there be an vacancy rate in the nhs and one in call handler post be vacant we all know the consequence of ambulance delay for pensioner and of cancel operation and appointment interruption do the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden wish to make an intervention thank you that be kind in basildon and billericay pensioner will lose out because of this callous cut by the labour government the hon member point out the impact on public service but how many more hospital admission will we have and how many more people will need operation because of his party cut will we be unable to find out because his party will not even put forward an impact assessment so that we can know who be affect we will take no lecture on hospital admission give the state of the nhs that the right hon member party leave we the conservatives claim that they do not know what the pay review body recommendation would be but the school teachers review body recommendation be know to ministers before july they will know also that the different prb tend to make similar recommendation why be most of those recommendation not submit in good time because ministers be late in submit their evidence push the timetable until after the election the office of manpower economics have say the work of the prbs be demand lead and essentially non negotiable department set the remit and timetable shadow ministers talk about productivity gain but when it come to nhs negotiation under the last government productivity be just slogan the cupboard be bare they have nothing to actually ask for the hon gentleman be make case compare the salary of work individual with the pension of the elderly could he tell how many of the people who will lose the winter fuel allowance in his constituency earn or receive less than the minimum wage in my constituency there be approximately pensioner household that do not receive pension credit that be one of the legacy of the previous government but be entitle to it the conservatives suggest that they would have reject the pay review body recommendation forget that one of the first act of the margaret thatcher government in be to accept the recommendation of the clegg commission on pay comparability if only the conservative party have more courage today the winter fuel allowance exist because of labour government government who increase the value of those payment fivefold in year compare with an increase of zero under year of the previous government real term cut of it be fascinating to hear the recent convert to the fight against poverty on the opposition benches particularly the right hon member for north west durham sorry basildon and billericay mr holden yet they seem far quieter about the fact that the average food shop go up by in the last parliament the average energy bill go up listen and you might learn something the average mortgage go up because of your lot interruption apology madam deputy speaker on point of order madam deputy speaker seek your guidance be under the impression that in the chamber we should refer to members friends or even the constituency be that correct the hon member be absolutely correct may just helpfully point out to all hon and right hon member that in seek to make repeat intervention they be actually cut into each other time have make the point previously about the correct way to address each other through as deputy speaker intervention need to be great deal shorter because they be just cut into the time for the debate and there be an awful lot of member who wish to contribute on point of order madam deputy speaker would like advice from the chair please reportedly more than labour mp receive more than million in donation before the election from the trade union before other member give speech about issue such as public sector pay would it not be in order for they to declare that interest at the beginning of their speech as the hon member will know it be for individual member to declare their interest if one be applicable declare my background in the trade union movement and note that the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy write the manifesto which he stand on that propose cut the winter fuel allowance now that the winter fuel allowance be to be mean test we must boost the uptake of pension credit welcome the measure ministers have announce today so that the allowance can be protect for the very poor pensioner the government choice to remove the winter fuel payment from of my constituent be cruel the payment have be lifeline for so many pensioner help they to stay warm during the harsh winter month most pensioner live on fix income so have almost no notice no time to prepare mean that the impact of this loss of income on many pensioner household will be that it be increasingly difficult for they to afford basic necessity number of labour members have talk about difficult choice but the reality be that the government have run away from difficult choice they have duck the difficult choice the difficult choice would have be to be upfront with voter during the election campaign to explain why they feel this be necessary appropriate and as some have say morally right and to trust voter to decide whether to give they that mandate instead they run away there be difficult choice but unfortunately the difficult choice be the one that they have leave our constituent to face do my hon friend agree that this choice set dangerous precedent free bus pass prescription charge and indeed access to healthcare itself be all now at risk because of the logic be put forward by the labour party in respect of pensioner ability to afford they my hon friend be clearly correct many people but particularly pensioner will be worried about what this chancellor will take away from they next without these payment many will be force to choose between heat their home and other essential expense such as food or medication people such as my constituent linda who write to my husband have several medical issue this year and be very worried about the heating situation think it be likely that we will cut back on nourish food can not believe that british government would penalize our generation like this another constituent dawn write now fear the winter month and afraid of hypothermia personally be just above the threshold to qualify for pension credit be single person claim state pension and also have small nhs pension can foresee not use my central heating this winter those be difficult choice that this chancellor and this government have force on too many of our pensioner and they be choice that no one should have to make and particularly not those who have contribute so much to our society the government the hon gentleman support be responsible for drive living standard down in the first parliament on record in which that happen do he not agree that it be traditionally bad form for the arsonist to start criticise the fire brigade think that the hon gentleman have huge amount of cheek he should consider first the inheritance of that previous conservative government the present candidate for the chairmanship of the business and trade committee have write that there be no money leave he should also bear in mind that what we see during those year be not only restoration in the economy but huge growth in pensioner income and what we see now be the fast growth in the unemployment at record low level and inflation also back at low level the chancellor want we to believe that this decision suddenly come to she at some point in the run up to the king speech some time after the general election and that it would not have be possible for she to imagine it before polling day she claim in july that it be not decision that she want to make however as have already be point out in march she stand at the opposition dispatch box barely foot away from where be now demand that winter fuel payment be mean test in july she say that it be not decision that she expect to make yet miraculously this year labour manifesto be the first in almost two decade without that specific commitment to protect winter fuel payment this be decision that have be decade in the making decade in the planning labour have decade in which to prepare and get it right but we be see how poorly think through it be we can not have social security advisory committee report and we can not have an impact assessment labour imagine that it could take the money away from pensioner with no impact on our nhs or on charity this decision be wrong and it need to be reverse many opposition members have throw the word choice at we their party choose empty promise choose unfunded policy choose course that lead to the decimation of our public service and to high mortgage rate and high bill and choose to make the former member of parliament for south west norfolk prime minister we do not want to make this choice but some choice be thrust upon we we on the labour benches do not duck choice this government be choose long term economic stability economic security and growth this government be choose to maintain the triple lock which will see the state pension rise year on year this government be choose to do all in their power to make sure that hundred of thousand of pensioner claim pension credit and they will do lot more do the hon member agree that it be deeply disingenuous for he and other labour members to talk about the drive to increase the uptake of pension credit he know full well that if the government be able to do that it would wipe out the saving that they be claim to make they do not actually want people to increase their uptake of pension credit because the government would not save any money order remind the hon member that the word disingenuous be almost akin to suggest that someone be lie perhaps he would like to withdraw his remark will replace disingenuous with deeply deeply concern thank the hon gentleman for his intervention and for clarify his use of language can assure he that everyone on the labour benches include my colleague on the front bench be do everything they can to make sure that vulnerable pensioner who need pension credit receive it we say that in good faith and we mean it what do the hon member say to the pensioner in my constituency who will lose the winter fuel payment they include rita who look after her husband who have multiple sclerosis she write to today to say that she have to make the choice this winter between heat their home and pay for essential medication thank the hon gentleman for his intervention say to he and his constituent that the government be make every effort to ensure that vulnerable pensioner and pensioner who need pension credit receive it we be stick by the triple lock to make sure that pensioner be well off year on year and be glad and proud that we be do so will the hon gentleman give way will make some progress if may have already take two intervention this government be choose to move on from the terrible choice of the previous government we be choose stable strong economy that will benefit all of the people of this country all demographic in all region the next generation and definitely pensioner fuel poverty be an enormous issue in my constituency due to combination of demographic geography the housing stock and indeed living standard rise to speak on behalf of the many hundred of my constituent who have write to to express their deep concern about the government policy do not have time to read out extract from their very moving email but know that judy kenneth pat tom robert and gwen be all deeply concerned about the impact that it will have they have report their health issue their partner disability and the fact that they be just over the limit and will not be able to access the winter fuel payment that will force they into the classic depress choice between heating and eat that this country must avoid have vote against the government policy today for three reason first it be socially regressive and will increase poverty among about million people nearly million of whom ought to be get pension credit the labour party effort be nowhere near fast enough to avoid increase poverty this winter secondly the policy be economically innumerate it will not save the money that the government argue it will save there be far well way to save that money and to fund the action that be certainly need to support our public service thirdly the policy be frankly politically inept really can not believe that this government have spend political capital on make such an unfortunate and unjustifiable political decision the winter fuel payment be not and never be perfect policy have some sympathy with member who have speak today about the inequity of the inclusion error whereby those who have significant wealth be still receive the payment but that have be replace by policy with an enormous and dangerous error of exclusion for those million people who will no long get the support that they need of course millionaire do not need the winter fuel payment but do the hon member agree that there must be support for pensioner who really need it rather than this cruel cliff edge especially for those live in rural area such as my constituency who be not connect to the main gas grid thank the hon member for his point like he live in rural constituency with many people who be not connect to main source of power this cliff edge be key problem and it have be refer to today by member from across the house there must be well way and that require well sort of politic have be in this chamber today for the entirety of this debate and the one before on the statutory instrument and have be very disappointed by the tone of some of the comment the discussion the debate and the argumentation that have hear it be the sort of politic that put people off what we do here in this chamber this be classic example of how we need to find way to speak well about such fundamental issue there must be an option to find some common ground in the spirit of constructive criticism and constructive engagement urge the government to stop to review to think again and to work out way of meet their need to find funding for public service in such way that it do not place the burden on those not with the broad shoulder but effectively with the narrow we need to find way of talk not just about how we deal with fuel subsidy but about make sure that every house be warm and well insulated so that the money be not just go up the chimney out of the window and into the pocket of the energy company we must invest for the long term so that every home be warm and every pensioner can keep warm two month ago the labour party be elect promise change and government of public service although their announcement to cut winter fuel payment be change doubt it be one that million of pensioner up and down the land think that they would make in term of government of service struggle to think of great disservice to million of pensioner than take away the winter fuel payment on which they rely pensioner who have work hard all their life deserve dignity and respect in their retirement instead of this harsh and ill judge policy from labour many of those pensioner will be force to make tough decision this winter about whether to have the heating on as energy price rise and temperature drop the government have admit to in response to parliamentary question that shockingly they believe that of my constituent in epping forest will have their winter fuel allowance withdraw by the labour government this winter among the more than million pensioner right across england who will have this lifeline withdraw this could have so many implication for the health of old people who spend more time inside their home when face condition some of which need social care there be real concern that be cold at home may have detrimental effect on people health as we have hear from some of our medical colleague today result in respiratory disease rise blood pressure an increase risk of stroke and heart attack and even hypothermia it be recommend by the uk health security agency that the temperature should be in living area and in bedroom which pensioner be go to struggle with this winter in stone great wyrley and penkridge over pensioner be go to lose their winter fuel payment of course so many of they be incredibly proud and do not want to apply for additional benefit and so many will be just outside of be eligible the decision of this government be condemn they to cold and incredibly hard winter my right hon friend be exactly right that many people be too proud to claim these benefit and that many people be just above the cut off point these people have be portray by some labour members as rich and able to deal with it but that be not the case be proud that our conservative government not only provide winter fuel payment but extensively support old people and the country through difficult time during the pandemic and the effect of the war in the ukraine and very importantly that they honour the conservative triple lock mean that pensioner get the pension increase they deserve be also proud that my party be continue to defend old people include through the compassionate conservative motion that trigger this debate and vote and that be proud to sign the economic decision we make speak volume about our value as society and country how the labour government respond to this debate on winter fuel payment and how they respond in the upcoming budget be their chance to show where their value truly lie this government need to confirm that now and in the upcoming budget their need to save money will not come at the expense of old people and the financial support they need this government really need to think again about their move to cut winter fuel payment for the sake of the million of old people who need they and for the implication it will have if labour choose to continue with this heartless policy my constituent and the constituent of conservative colleague can be assure that my party and will continue to stand up for our pensioner and will maintain our call that the winter fuel payment cut be reverse rise will reduce the time limit still far to two minute after the next speaker my volunteer and have be out speak to resident across my constituency every weekend since the general election like many other earley and woodley be very diverse constituency with diverse need last weekend we speak to relatively well off pensioner who tell we that they feel it be right that winter fuel payment be mean test and that with their sense of dignity and generosity they do not need state aid in this respect pensioner in other part of my constituency be less well off and be shocked to find that one in three pensioner in my constituency who be eligible for pension credit which be roughly pensioner as well as one in three across the uk who be eligible for pension credit or do not claim it over the weekend hold one of my first constituency surgery at the whitley community development association café staff member tell that they talk to the pensioner who come in about the struggle they face with the cost of living crisis that have unravel over the last few year they talk to they about support but these elderly people respond no do need benefit do need help recognise that as part of the broad societal stigma around be recipient of benefit and state aid which this government must challenge and defeat compassionate generous and dignified society recognise when people require help when people do not require help and when people can help other and accept that people sometimes fall on hard time due to an accident bereavement illness or other reason outside their control for those who need help it be not undignified to seek it in fact it be very important that every pensioner listen to my speech whether they be in my earley and woodley constituency or elsewhere in the uk know how to seek help and can seek it if they need it be determined that we bring about dignified and fair means test benefit and tax system fairness and dignity will keep that system function member on both side of the house have talk about civility we too often hear about individual and societal group be pit against each other pensioner in earley and woodley be part of the broad community and they have child and grandchild who work in hospital who require care who be support by teacher who take bus and train and yes who avail themselves of all the mean of support provide to maintain our flourish and cohesive society it be unacceptable order call rebecca harris about pensioner in castle point be set to lose their winter fuel payment under this cruel and vindictive policy that the labour government have choose to adopt contrary to the accusation from the government have with the support of former work and pensions ministers run campaign after campaign to increase the uptake of pension credit only pensioner receive it in my constituency despite campaign after campaign and leaflette group and church it be not easy to get people to take it up some be proud have raise my voice with elderly lady who have say it be charity and tell they no it not it not charity we do think you can live without it we have try very hard hundred of worried constituent have write to about heat their home we have lot of low energy efficiency home include one of the big park home site in the country and have many park home site fortunately we manage to find million from the previous government to retrofit some of they but we still have lot of people live in fuel inefficient home that be hard to retrofit the worry that this be cause people be the big issue see now and it show how out of touch and arrogant the labour government be that they do not understand this about pensioner people who be and on fix income may have little bit of saving or modest private pension think all hon member be very disappointed not to see proper impact analysis of this decision do my hon friend agree that the good way to analyse the impact of such policy be to speak to the people who send we to this place as she be say and to hear the utter fear and concern they have about its impact my hon friend be spot on it be the anxiety that it cause people they do not know if they will live another month or year people on fix income with no ability to raise that income be very worried about spend money there be also large and sadly grow cohort of elderly resident who be develop dementia and one of the early symptom often be financial anxiety include in people whom we would think of as really quite wealthy have know resident who have regress to think that they be still live under rationing because they grow up as lad in abject poverty and they will not spend money be tell here for fuel make world of difference to those people be not fan of gordon brown who once give derisory increase to pensioner but this policy be huge success credit to he that be why my government never change it for for every pensioner we give incredible peace of mind that they can put their heating on do my hon friend worry as do that some of our constituent will die this year as result of this policy do not think that need to worry think we know that will happen because we know about their behaviour and their concern about put the heating on and their lack of understanding of how much every heating bill will cost they this be psychologically very important to know that they could put their heating on to keep they healthy and out of hospital of all the tough decision that we have to consider when we come into office in when there be no magicked up home make billion black hole excuse there be vast deficit and we have to make lot of tough decision we never make this one be sure labour members never think in the general election campaign that they would be give pensioner the choice between heating and eat many labour members have not even bother to turn up for debate on something so critical for many pensioner across this country we have talk about choice and this be all about choice the government have make political choice labour members will all have to make choice and face their constituent whether they vote for or against urge they not to cut the winter fuel allowance let go on journey and set out the narrative the government say there be debt and imagine there be black hole they have to fill so let we have look at the number they say they have to find billion so let we cut billion but in the same breath add billion for the pension at the same time the red herring that be the great british energy flop add another billion that be decision that the government have make but why would the labour party let number get in the way of good story the number show the government have no issue make decision against pensioner be proud veteran in november on remembrance day we ask people to remember those who pay the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country challenge labour members to look at pensioner who have serve and say we will never forget because those pensioner have already be forget in the spirit of what my hon friend describe will cite the example of betty webb constituent of mine who receive an mbe for her work as codebreaker at bletchley park she be year old she be widow who live alone she be live in fear not just that the government will take away the winter fuel allowance but that in future they will snatch away the single person discount on council tax many other constituent of mine be fearful of the same thing my hon friend make great point pensioner include those who have give life of service to this country be live in fear of what be come next almost third of resident in south shropshire be pensioner and they have be write to and they be absolutely livid they feel like they have be lead down the garden path take away this payment be not what be promise it be cruel heartless and callous this policy need to change the chancellor have make rookie error she have go into the treasury and with everything in front of she say do this and she have remove the personal view she have make political of course it be rookie error this be massive error she have listen and remove people from the equation when people be remove from politic it be road to nowhere will the chancellor go and see the downing street chief of staff and ask for permission to reverse this proposal nearly of my constituent will lose their winter fuel payment currently only will receive it that be massive cliff edge for those resident while many of they may feel that they do not require that payment as have be mention by other hon member the vast majority of those pensioner fall into low and middle income bracket because thing do not have such high financial value in the south west as the hon member for north cornwall ben maguire allude to many property be off grid member may not have realise that of home across the south west do not have gas which be much cheap source of energy they resort to use oil and log to heat their home with the enormous cost that go with they that be an additional challenge concern have be raise about those who be single those in receipt of the old basic state pension which be not as high as the new state pension and those with health condition the first resident to contact be year old single man on an old style pension who be just outside the bracket for pension credit or any other form of benefit who be deeply concerned about this winter my hon friend make good point about those with health condition do she agree that there be no provision in the proposal for those live with dementia or long term frailty those be not means test disease or condition yet the government have not make any provision or assessment of how those live with dementia will miss out agree my hon friend make an incredibly important point about those vulnerable old people who live with dementia many of our constituent will be in that situation why be we not look at alternative way to deal with this cliff edge couple of year ago the conservative party propose the council tax rebate scheme which use the council tax system as mechanism to ensure the most vulnerable receive support single person household those where someone have dementia or household in receipt of council tax credit because they do not have particularly high income receive discount through the council tax rebate scheme that system could be replicate with the winter fuel payment which would offer an alternative way of avoid that cliff edge for so many resident finally know that health have already be mention but wish to use this as an opportunity to highlight the fact that so many more elderly people will need hospital care this winter but that be massively impact and at risk because the government will not confirm which of the new hospital programme be go forward in particular the emergency and urgent care centre in plymouth will be vital to provide the healthcare that our old people will need if they be unable to heat their home or to look after themselves and to ensure that they have all the support they need it be only two month ago that labour win majority in the general election on message of change but in those two month the new labour uk government have refuse to abolish the cruel two child benefit cap and now seek to take away winter fuel payment of up to from million of pensioner across the uk by limit it to recipient of pension credit well nothing have change some of household in carmarthenshire live in home with poor energy efficiency in and of household in my caerfyrddin seat live off the gas grid often rely on oil as heat source but the price of oil be very volatile and in winter we can see it go up by or litre cause uncertainty for people budget over the winter not heat home can have serious consequence cold home bring with it high risk of stroke respiratory infection and fall or other injury the end fuel poverty coalition estimate that nearly excess winter death be cause by live in cold home during the winter of and many old vulnerable people have high energy cost due to health reason it be shame that the minister of state for crime policing and fire misspoke early this week as the consideration of other option such as social tariff or different way of mean testing would be welcome as constructive criticism can the government bring the winter fuel payment within the definition of taxable income to ensure that pensioner get what they need in closing call on colleague to consider whether they can justify order call alicia kearns rise to speak on behalf of the pensioner in rutland stamford and the harborough and south kesteven village who will lose their winter fuel payment this winter this decision affect million of people who buy into our country social contract you work hard you pay your taxis and when you grow old we will support you through your retirement make two request of the labour government although know that they will both be reject first ask they to delay implementation to give people more time to prepare old people be some of the most financially cautious in our society they save they go without they avoid debt and they give what they can to their child their grandchild and their friend in need delay of year would give people the time to claim pension credit if eligible to face the upcoming increase in energy bill and to plan for the next winter secondly ask the government to give an exemption to anyone suffer from chronic or life shortening illness since this cut be announce have hear from so many people include di who email out of concern not for herself but for her husband jeff who suffer from cancer and have to wear three layer of clothe all year round even in the summer as di put it the decision and it be decision by the prime minister be penalise the ill her hubby will suffer and she be shatter we will hear lot from the government about hard choice but if be ask to choose between heat the home of the elderly cancer sufferer and dementia sufferer or give no string attach pay rise to train driver already on nearly the choice would be pretty damn obvious to but then aslef do not donate to my election campaign people say that we can tell lot about society by how it treat its most vulnerable and its eld if we apply that test to this cut anyone with heart will know that it be wrong for one will never vote to deprive the most vulnerable and our elderly of warmth when be year old start deliver meal on wheels on christmas day for the disadvantaged around west london and have do so every year since that have live in london the scheme be organise by age uk and it be privilege to be invite into people home in midwinter look forward to do it again this christmas and hope that those visit last year will be there this year the government be seek to raise money and get that they be seek to do so by get those with the broad shoulder to take the heavy load and get that too in order to achieve those goal the government be mean test the winter fuel payment and there be the rub by choose that mean test the government be indeed take the winter fuel payment from millionaire pensioner but they be also take it from the much less well off and from the not well off at all in short they be cut too deep mistake happen but it be how we deal with mistake that be important spend the weekend listen to the prime minister use the word tough as many time as he possibly could on the battlefield of the world which have be on for the last year toughness be not one of the thing that people look for in their leader the two thing they look for be courage and competence courage moral courage sometimes mean that people need to admit when they have make mistake and change their plan however the people of spelthorne and suspect the pensioner across the country would just settle for bit of competence this government need to get good at governing and they need to do so quickly we have hear description today of pensioner as millionaire we have hear that this be principled decision to cut money from they be astonish at that description like my hon friend the member for south west devon rebecca smith be from the south west the south west of scotland and can count on one hand would suggest the number of millionaire pensioner there even if their home be worth million have rise in price through no fault of theirs they be asset rich and that be very different from be cash and liquidity rich if they be hit with bill they can not sell their home that leave people in an absolute bind we have hear very little today from the snp because in scotland the snp government have the ability to ameliorate this decision should it go ahead it will cost they estimate million accept that be not button it be not peanut however the last conservative government send billion to scotland and think we should be able to find that money in scotland to help the bad off in our society this be wrong headed decision and be astonish to hear it be describe as principled decision since the announcement of the government plan and colleague across this house have be inundate with heartfelt story of elderly people across the country who will be unfairly harm by the removal of the winter fuel allowance it be concern that the impact be not properly assess before the government take this step in chichester we have pensioner who be not receive pension credit many of whom sit just above the threshold constituent such as sherry who be and registered disabled she have to maintain an even live temperature to deal with condition while live in year old cottage with poor insulation roy and his wife be in their late and have burn through their meagre saving cover their rise energy bill during this cost of living crisis vicky write to about have to choose between eat and heating in the current winter month because she will not be able to afford to do both our elderly who have work hard throughout their life be now be abandon by government that should be support they when they need help the most the liberal democrats understand the disastrous state our public finance have be leave in due to the fiscal mismanagement of the previous conservative government and we recognise that tough decision need to be make however those decision should not be make at the expense of our elderly the burden of this conservative fiscal chaos need to be spread to those with the broad shoulder rather than punish those who have already be hit hard by it cut the winter fuel allowance in the midst of cost of living crisis will leave thousand of elderly individual across chichester and million across the uk without the financial support they need to stay warm and healthy this winter with the price cap due to rise in october it could be argue that the winter fuel allowance be need this winter more than ever the change that the government announce this morning will mean than of my constituent will go without their winter fuel payment this christmas in the brief time that have will set out why believe that be just the start from the government the first reason be that cut winter fuel payment for poor pensioner be political choice not necessity despite what the leader of the house say over the election period labour say that it would not cut the winter fuel payment it have break its promise to the british people and they will remember that labour also say that it would possibly do more although it have deny that it would not do more today measure will save billion as outline in my early intervention but labour have award inflation bust pay rise of billion to its union paymaster can the hon member explain to the house and to his constituent why he would not back fair pay rise for teacher nurse prison officer and member of the armed force in his constituency will not take any lecture from the hon member but say to he that always defend pay rise for people in this country who deserve they which be exactly what the conservative government do what our government do not do be award inflation bust pay rise of to the people who pay for our general election campaign increase inflation in this country believe that people deserve pay rise but that should be do within responsible fiscal envelope the labour government simply have not do that as we hear from the chancellor early the measure that she have announce will cost more than the saving generate from scrap the winter fuel payment that be shamble the government have do this at time when energy bill will increase by despite the labour party promise in opposition that it would freeze energy bill another broken promise that pensioner will have to face this christmas the government have also refuse to rule out scrap the single occupancy discount for pensioner and single people if that go ahead they will deprive pensioner of another on average that be political choice and cost of live bombshell that this labour government supposedly the party of hard work people will impose on vulnerable and poor pensioner across the country labour members have choice this afternoon and go forward they should reverse the cut stand up for the thousand of people in their constituency who will be make poor by the government and reject the measure that they outline early let put it this way people in my constituency rely on the winter fuel payment as do thousand of labour members constituent when we go to the ballot box in four year time look forward to labour members stand up and explain to those pensioner why they make they poor in my first speech in this chamber assure the house than my nan would keep on my toe even before the cut to the winter fuel payment have hit the news headline she be on the phone to to sort it out my nan be one of pensioner in broxbourne who will end up lose year vital sum of money that would help they to keep their home warm this winter the government priority be clearly dictate by their union paymaster so be tempt to advise my nan to start her own pensioner union if there be one be sure that pensioner would have see their winter fuel payment go up rather than be abolish when we put the chancellor decision into context it be even more staggering labour deal with the union which have cost the taxpayer billion will see the average salary of train driver who be already well pay rise from to year help for heating bill be be take away from the elderly but the energy price cap be go up by in few week time double blow for pensioner be make it more expensive for pensioner to heat their home in labour manifesto it be not in fact we be tell that labour would slash fuel poverty and save family hundred of pound that be yet another broken promise and labour have be in power for only week my nan be not the only one to have get in touch with about this have be inundate with letter and email from hundred of constituent winter be come and strongly urge the government to change course my constituency have high proportion of people in receipt of winter fuel payment than most other constituency over of they be set to lose that vital support constituent have tell that they face choice between eating and heating other have tell that they be concerned for their health during the cold winter month their story be powerful reminder of the human cost of this decision maggie be and live in handbridge in my constituency she work as midwife in the nhs for year so have state pension and small nhs pension she be not eligible for additional benefit because she be careful with what she earn and save wisely maggie be just above the threshold to be eligible for continued support she be also dual cancer survivor have beat breast cancer in and bowel cancer in maggie be understandably worried about the consequence of be unable to heat her home this winter there be also the story of jackie and john who live in audlem like many people live in rural village they live off grid and do not have access to main gas they must rely on heat oil to heat their home pensioner who have pay into the system all their work life ought to be able to enjoy their retirement with dignity security and respect we all know in this house that to govern be to choose labour have choose it have choose its union paymaster over our vulnerable pensioner community it have let down maggie john and jackie and many other like they urge the government to listen with compassion and reconsider this political decision for over five year have be raise the issue of impact assessment and the fact that they do not make sense see the opposition front benchers nod along because they know that have be raise that issue impact assessment be do on stupid basis that do not make any sense and certainly not in today world if the opposition front benchers have only change it when they have the opportunity we would not be in this situation today but the labour party have the opportunity to change the way we do impact assessment so that they actually make sense they should be about not just whether business will be impact to the tune of million but what matter to people and whether their life will be impact by change in policy that be the point at which impact assessment should be do we do not have an impact assessment for this policy do the labour party and the uk government know that single woman be three time more likely to be miss out on pension credit than single man do the labour party know that pensioner who be black or from asian ethnic background be more likely to be in poverty than white pensioner do it therefore know that this decision have differential impact on minority community be that why it have refuse to share the impact assessment with we how will this policy grow the economy how will ensure that pensioner who we know spend in their local community have less money to spend in those local shop grow the economy the issue with all of this be not whether we have tory or labour government it be that westminster consistently fail to work for the people of scotland find it slightly ironic that we be debate this policy today this be about political choice policy that be bring in under gordon brown social democratic policy of inclusivity under which everyone buy into the state be be scrap in favour of neoliberal means test policy one that think most actual labour socialist would be ashamed of declare an interest be member of care campaign for the vulnerable which help elderly resident who have medical issue or be in care one of the issue for those elderly people be heat these be the elderly who fight for the reconstruction of britain in post war london and across the uk have rationing for year and year and pay their taxis we have build this country on the back of their hard work and sacrifice only to turn around and say no we do not scrap this policy under year of conservative government but we be scrap it as the first thing we do as labour government be not even blame the minister the hon member for ealing north james murray know the minister and his parent when they be councillor with in ealing true socialist for the many not the few be not sure that apply here this be political choice to give labour union paymaster pay rise over vulnerable pensioner this be about pay billion or billion for an energy company that will not generate single watt of energy this be about political choice and political will if we the conservatives could keep labour policy for our entire time in government it be shocking and dishearten that the labour party be make this choice now maybe in two minute this debate can well be sum up with lesser know fable the farmer and the viper farmer be walk through his field it be very cold in the winter and he find viper just under the bush the viper be cold limp and almost dead the farmer know it be poisonous but he feel compassion for the creature pick it up and put it in his pocket as the creature become warm it revert to type and bit he and as he die in that field he say get what deserve should have show kindness to scoundrel that ring true because after year of the labour party be out in the cold the pensioner of this country back labour into government under an impression create by the prime minister only in may he goad our government ask will the prime minister now rule out taking pensioner winter fuel payment off report may vol if we scratch the surface little bit deeply though we find that on march the now chancellor say that we be the party who have say that we will cut the winter fuel allowance for the rich pensioner and mean test that benefit to save report march vol so this be not response to concocted black hole this be choice as laura kuenssberg point out it be choice to pay the union on the back of our pensioner the public be not stupid the cartoonist matt sum it up perfectly when he say surprisingly robin hood nobody like your plan to steal from pensioner to give to train driver be in the chamber last week when the secretary of state for energy security and net zero say that conservative member should show bit of bravery even break the whip and stand out from the crowd official report september vol be disappointed that labour members do not take that advice with only one labour mp do so call another doctor dr kieran mullan rise to express my strong opposition to the government decision to remove the winter fuel payment from million of pensioner move that will strip vital financial support from thousand of my constituent people who have contribute to our country and help to build it the impact in bexhill and battle will be profound age uk estimate that more than pensioner will lose their winter fuel payment as result of this decision hope the government understand just how significant their decision be in constituency such as mine the government say that they be focus on increase the uptake of pension credit if all those who be eligible to claim pension credit do so though the billion that the treasury be expect to save by mean test the winter fuel payment will be dwarf by the increase in the cost of pension credit so the government have to admit that ultimately they do not actually want all those pensioner to take up pension credit our pensioner deserve well the fall back of this government since they take office be to blame the previous government for all the unpopular action they have decide to take they claim the state of the economy be reason to remove this vital lifeline for pensioner but let we be clear about the fact on broad range of indicator the situation they have inherit be significantly less challenging than the one we inherit in we inherit an economy just out of the deep recession since labour leave we with public sector net borrowing at of gdp today it be at unemployment in be unemployment now stand at however from onwards through all these difficult time we make decision to protect pensioner and we make sure to keep the winter fuel payment it be the right thing to do then and it be the right thing to do now ask the government to listen to mps from across the house include some on their own benches and think again the prime minister and labour members try to bring this country together after division and turmoil and today have to say they have succeed they have unite the country they have unite it in opposition to this new labour government and their attack on old people the very people who deserve compassion dignity and respect after their lifetime of hard work stand unashamedly shoulder to shoulder with pensioner in upper bann and across the united kingdom in their opposition to this reckless decision our pensioner be be leave out in the cold by government who promise to restore hope where be the compassionate labour we be promise where be the restore hope what hope do pensioner have in upper bann what hope do they have that this government might listen care for they and stop neglect they they now feel like they be the target to be fair this government have offer pensioner something to keep they busy through the cold winter month by suggest they take stab at complete the pension credit application form form with question across page with delay of nine week for decision they be ask pensioner to navigate bureaucratic nightmare just to receive fraction of what they need to survive stand here today unite with my constituent and unite with pensioner across this country in opposition to this baseless decision in conclusion no one be argue that millionaire should get the winter fuel payment but over million of the pensioner set to be impact by this decision be live on the state pension they be live on just over year could anyone in this house live on year mid norfolk be profoundly rural constituency with village and four town and in that very rural constituency as with all rural area in this country people be pay surcharge because of energy cost and because of rurality there will be cold weather and many of my house be not on the gas grid while rural area traditionally have low income and we have an elderly population the treasury very helpfully it be shame ministers do not read it do piece of work last year look at the risk of rural poverty and the high risk of rural area fall into real poverty the treasury own figure show that the average household at risk of poverty in rural area need an extra or in layman term there be two and half time or risk of rural house fall into rural poverty so find it completely extraordinary that labour which in government profess to care about poverty and berate my party when in government about the risk of rural poverty and of pensioner poverty have decide as their first act to punish people in rural area it be because of those rural risk that early this year and number of colleague set up fair funding alliance support by action with communities in rural england the countryside alliance and rural body high fuel and energy price be hit rural area and we would have hop that this government might have listen be proud that the conservative party in government upgrade pension protect the triple lock and take pensioner out of poverty the former member for thornbury and yate introduce the triple lock which be actually liberal democrat policy would the hon member care to correct the record on that point it be my good friend the now noble lord willetts in coalition government with the liberal democrats and will happily debate with the hon member some of the brave decision we take the point be that this party the conservative party protect pensioner protect the triple lock and lift people out of poverty but we see this labour government make this decision the minister put it very clearly early this be an attack on people who own their own home people who have retire in rural area and those just over the threshold and in labour world they be millionaire this will not be forget by people in my constituency the low income rural pensioner who have save up to be able to afford their own home and be now be clobber it be unfair it be unjust it be unjustifiable it be unprecedented and urge and beg ministers to think again rise to voice my strong opposition to the labour government cruel choice to scrap the winter fuel allowance for an estimate million pensioner across the country have be contact by hundred of pensioner in my constituency who be all incredibly concerned about the dire consequence of this government decision meet many of they in surgery and at keighley agricultural show this weekend and they be tell that they be go to struggle to pay their bill this winter statistic show that just over pensioner across the bradford district include in my constituency will be negatively impact as result of the labour government decision that quite frankly be disgrace citizens advice age uk and hundred of charity across the uk have also come out against these proposal warn that low income household that be already struggle to make end meet will be force this winter into impossible choice between heat their home or put food on the table it be incredibly disappointing to see the hon member for shipley anna dixon from the bradford district vote with the government this evening ensure that she do not stand up for the wide bradford district as will be do it be labour choice that we be put pensioner at risk as result of this decision and labour choice that be put my constituent pensioner who be vulnerable in the dire position of have to decide whether they heat their home or put food on the table this winter only hope that quick change will be make to ensure that pensioner be look after in the run up to winter some pensioner in angus and perthshire glens will be strip of their winter fuel payment by this labour government can not tell the house how cold it get in angus and perthshire glens in wintertime but if anyone on the labour front bench want to come and sit in my garage on january day will turn the heating off in the whole property and they can see what it will be like for some pensioner in my constituency will not be support this measure because it be incompetent it be incompetent operationally because it do not take cognisance of co morbidity in already frail people or of what will happen to those people as they budget to try to accommodate this unnecessary cut to their income it be fiscally incompetent because it do not take cognisance of whole system cost people present at hospital or go into care prematurely because they can not stay at home because of what they do to try to make end meet it do not take account of the cost to the suppose saving of billion once pension credit be take up fully render the saving meaningless it be morally incompetent because as we have hear from professional in the chamber as result of this decision people will die moreover this measure be not in the labour party manifesto which be reprehensible and it ignore the cultural sensitivity of old people many of whom find ask for help anathema they will never do it no matter how entitled they be very much hope that when the minister sum up the debate she will estimate how many of the extra labour mps in this house include in scotland would be here if cut the winter fuel payment have be on the face of their manifesto it would be very many few speak on behalf of pensioner in my constituency who be set to lose their winter fuel allowance some of my constituent be age or over which be well above the national average many retired people in my constituency have do the right thing they have work all their life pay their national insurance stamp and now have small private pension and modest saving it be because they have do the right thing that many of those pensioner be not eligible to claim pension credit this government be choose to punish they for the prudent and conscientious choice they make through their work life by withdraw this important mean of support labour justify the decision to cut the winter fuel allowance by talk about its alleged poor economic inheritance let we take moment to clear up some fact in the budget deficit be about of gdp at billion today it be about of gdp in unemployment be about and today it have halve and be about in may inflation be today it be this be not the bad economic inheritance since the war be sure my hon friend will agree when say that the economic inheritance that the government receive be incredible consider that we have to deal with the covid pandemic crisis as well as the russian invasion of ukraine that put huge pressure on our economy my hon friend make an important point it just emphasise the fact that when the chancellor say that it be tough decision that have to be make she be actually make political choice she have choose to give train driver earn year pay rise of she have choose to cut the income of retire people with pension of year that be her choice and the british people will judge she and the labour party on it let we be absolutely clear about what have happen today every single labour mp who vote to cut the winter fuel allowance have break their promise to the country pensioner know that before the election labour deny that it be go to do this but they might not know that the chancellor have be plan it for year in she say we will cut the winter fuel allowance for the rich pensioner and mean test that benefit to save report march vol be we suppose to believe that she change her mind after that and then change it back again shortly after the general election do not think so there may be case for means testing but the chancellor be cut the payment not just for the rich pensioner but for pensioner on very modest income she be also not make the case for it she be ask the secretary of state for work and pensions to do her dirty work for she if winter fuel payment be to be mean test surely the proceed should go towards low income pensioner and the cost of social care but they be not they be go on above inflation pay rise for the like of labour donor aslef last friday in boston be stop by pensioner lovely lady call elizabeth who shake my hand and burst into tear uncontrollable tear of genuine fear she represent more than pensioner in boston and skegness who will lose out through this cruel policy it be the fear of be cold this winter not know how cold and the fear of what will happen to energy price in october how high will they go in january it be the unbelievable fear of not know whether she will see the end of winter because that be the reality old cold people die early we have hear about choice lot today it be true that this government have make calculate deliberate heartless cruel choice to enrich their union paymaster to enrich public sector worker with no requirement on productivity to enrich well pay train driver and to impoverish pensioner let tell this house that voter will not forget and they will not forgive some pensioner in gordon and buchan will lose their winter fuel payment follow today vote by the labour party but this decision for my constituent show that they be be let down by their government at holyrood and at westminster the labour party be choose to let they down by cut the winter fuel payment and the snp be choose not to pass on barnett consequential in north east scotland winter be long and harsh than in most of the country our temperature often fall below minus for sustained period and in recent year it have not be unusual to have have minus in aberdeenshire the winter fuel payment be not luxury for our pensioner it be lifeline this be the labour party choice as much as it would like to explain that choice away it have choose to cut the winter fuel payment and it must face what that mean labour choice mean that our pensioner now have to make their own choice so labour choice have become pensioner choice perhaps most shocking of all be labour breathtake hypocrisy on this issue in labour members on these opposition benches have their own research show that cut winter fuel payment could lead to almost excess death they then vehemently oppose any change to what they call that vital support what have change have pensioner suddenly become more resilient to the cold or have the labour party simply abandon its principle to fund its own political choice many pensioner in my constituency still rely on solid fuel such as oil so once year go into winter they fill up their tank payment for that will be come shortly before november and way before next year and any pension rise how will those pensioner afford to fill their tank and heat their home in the month to come rise be grateful for all the bobbing but we must now go to the front bench speaker call the shadow minister welcome the under secretary of state for work and pensions the hon member for wycombe emma reynolds to her place and wish she well it be pleasure to close the debate on behalf of his majesty official opposition but sadly that be where any pleasure at be at this dispatch box on this matter end we have debate clear and stark choice make by the new labour government the prime minister and his this black hole be what make do it chancellor it be patently poor political choice that be wrong headed and frankly disgrace it be blatant choice for union paymaster while ax key support for million pensioner it be reward for labour funder none of that be in the manifesto or on election leaflet it be pure subterfuge and hoodwinking no charity or group fully back this measure give the timescale and its cack handed and draconian delivery the government can bluster and say with the faux anger we hear early that they have be act with the hand they be give they can say that they simply have no choice and that this be necessity due to the fantasy inheritance they be allegedly leave let we look at the fact uk unemployment sit at sterling be up against the dollar and growth be outpace inflation despite some loyal speech from new government members and passionate speech from all around the chamber labour members know many of they be blank mute absent or perhaps even stunned that minister be target our pensioner with so little notice as the night draw in high winter fuel bill loom to dress up this measure under the cloak of financial necessity be staggering it be costly mistake from the treasury under the labour chancellor that the dwp will have to shoulder move staff swiftly to cover the incoming impact of those apply for pension credit what about those who have plan to pay for their pre christmas tank of off grid oil with their of expect support the demand surge for pension credit must be meet in both cost and delivery and dwp ministers will be scratch their head about where the resource will come from for the report surge in pension credit application rise will give way to the hon gentleman if he can tell we why he think this be good idea can assure the shadow minister that do not think it be good idea on the point that she and other have raise about no assessment have be do represent northern ireland where of home rely solely on oil for heat do she think that the government realise the additional pressure that will be put on northern ireland pensioner follow the decision our minister for communities announce today that people will lose the payment thank the hon gentleman for stand up for his constituent agree about the disproportionate and deep impact on our cold spot in northern ireland rural area the north and scotland this benefit reform will not be easy we bear the scar on the opposition benches from universal credit but the change be truly worth it as the hon gentleman say what do the impact assessment actually say who gain and do it stack up financially think we all know that it do not else the government would have not ignore the social security advisory committee process and its scrutiny they would have do proper impact assessment and regulatory assessment and they would not have try to avoid vote on the floor of the house government members will troop through the lobby again as fodder for an out of touch prime minister or they may abstain to avoid the eye of the chancellor deep in the hope that spray billion of pound on gimmick like shell company call gb energy will be worth it they must be aware that they will have to face people in their community who will want to understand why few millionaire be worth the attack on million let we take june she tell the bbc that she will struggle to stay warm this winter she be already plan her jumper cardigan and candle my constituent valerie from east grinstead write to one of almost affected and say be year old and live on state pension of less than not the that keep read about do know who get that much but certainly do she go on to say that it will be long cold winter please do what you can to get this dreadful decision reverse labour members could join we in the lobby to back pensioner like valerie the opposition welcome the household support fund extension and the commitment to the conservatives triple lock but we know go into winter with energy bill go up that the right thing to do be to help with cost of living payment in my experience as an mp and minister know that the worry and responsibility of this job come to all member in the dead of night it will be in the darkness and the cold in the small hour that woman and man who have serve this country and support family and community will be lie awake worried fret and feel afraid for those who be frail and live with disability or health condition warmth matter to their health loneliness isolation and worry will eat away at they because they can not take job or do some extra hour to help make end meet medic have warn that this will have serious health threat as have age uk pensioner on low income matter they truly be the people who know how to budget they be the people who eke out and work out their finance nobody will work out how this new labour government of service have target those people so shamefully this autumn those family will not forget they be not statistic they be valerie and june and thousand of other in every community and constituency they be proud pensioner who too often go without but do not tell other that they be again this winter they will go without for other this be horrific it be blight on this new government it be not right for this to happen to pensioner on their watch it be their choice ask that hon member and ministers do the right thing and stop this callous cut now this have be an important debate with many hon and right hon member make important contribution my hon friend the members for wirral west matthew patrick for bracknell peter swallow for bishop auckland sam rushworth for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray for rugby john slinger and for makerfield josh simons rightly speak about the importance of this government action to restore economic stability so that we can rebuild our economy and our public service my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield laurence turner rightly remind we that strong economy need strong public service many hon member both on will the minister give way be go to make little bit of progress many hon member both on will the minister give way say will make some progress thank you many hon member both on the government side and on the opposition benches include my hon friend the member for earley and woodley yuan yang and the hon member for castle point rebecca harris speak about the work they be do to encourage pensioner in their own constituency to apply for pension credit to get the support they need want to start by say some more about the principle that underlie the government approach to means test winter fuel payment first most help should be target to those who most need it secondly significant support for all pensioner will come around via the triple lock thirdly alongside that extra help will be available to those on low income will the minister give way will in minute before do that want to say something about means testing have find both in this debate and in the early debate in westminster hall where no conservative members be present that there be lot of support for means test the winter fuel payment we hear from the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale who say in this debate that he support means test this benefit we hear that the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch who be the conservative leadership contest favourite also support means test this benefit the hon lady have misrepresent she know perfectly well that while say support the principle abhor the way she be go about it the right hon gentleman do indeed say that he support the principle the liberal democrats in their manifesto of also say that they support means test this benefit thank the minister for give way but think she fail to understand that while we accept the principle of means testing we accept that there be many pensioner who can afford not to have the winter fuel payment it be the manner in which the labour government intend to bring it in with sharp cliff edge and no accounting for the people close to the pension credit limit that we find abhorrent will come on to that point but first want to say how crucial it be to boost the uptake of pension credit we be take immediate action to increase that take up give that up to an estimate eligible pensioner be miss out on this support worth on average hope there can be some consensus across the house that we need to work together to boost that uptake that be why last week we launch an initial pension credit week of action to boost awareness we will continue to raise awareness until the deadline december for make successful backdate pension credit claim grateful to the minister for give way on awareness be she aware how much more it cost to heat home in winter in blairgowrie compare with brighton or belgravia will come on to the issue the hon gentleman raise in just moment on pension credit my right hon friend the member for leicester west liz kendall the secretary of state for work and pensions and the deputy prime minister my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner have write to all local authority ask they to redouble their effort to reach those pensioner who could benefit from pension credit interruption the opposition front bench might grumble but it be far sight more than they ever do when they be in power we be join force with charity such as age uk and citizens advice to encourage pensioner to check their eligibility and apply we will be deliver major campaign in print and broadcast medium include to urge people to reach out to retire family friend and neighbour to get they to check if they be eligible will the minister give way on that point no will not for the very first time we be write to all pensioner in receipt of housing benefit who be potentially eligible to encourage they to claim pension credit again something that the last conservative government never do will the minister give way no will not over the last five week we have already see claim for pension credit more than double and back by more than additional staff we will ensure that claim be process as quickly as possible as my right hon friend the secretary of state for work and pensions say in the early debate we will bring forward the merger of housing benefit and pension credit as soon as that be operationally possible something that the last government promise but fail to deliver we be also take action to ensure that all pensioner get the income that they deserve despite be urge by the institute for fiscal studies and other to drop the triple lock during the election campaign the government be steadfast in their commitment to it the triple lock have see the state pension increase by over the last five year and it be increase by this year and by in the previous year accord to figure release today which still need to be confirm in october we will see the provision of an extra year from next april will the minister give way no will not moreover the warm home discount of will help low income pension household this year that be critically important because it be not just for the low income pensioner on pension credit it be for pensioner on low income who have high energy cost and it will be open to application in october rise have say to the hon lady that will not give way and will not give way so she should sit down the government encourage member to boost awareness and encourage people to apply for the warm home discount rise will give way thank the minister but should like she to explain why this government have fail to extract any concession from the train driver and their union paymaster rise have not finish the government digital centre of government be all ready to use technology to improve public service but there have be complete failure of negotiation and the price be be pay by our pensioner honestly think that conservative members have some brass neck during their time in power we lose an average of million working day year to strike because of their failure to deal with industrial action and we lose million nhs appointment which be cancel which mean that pensioner and other be in pain for long than they need to be we will not take lecture from the conservatives we have have to take this difficult decision to mean test the winter fuel payment because of the billion black hole in year this year interruption they may not want to hear it but they should apologise for leave that black hole it be create by repeat and reckless unfunded spending on point of order madam deputy speaker be the point of order directly relevant to the current proceeding yes madam deputy speaker just want some guidance from you on whether it can be appropriate for ministers and other on the government benches who have be directly fund by the trade union not to declare that personal benefit before do something like this which be hurt million of pensioner member be guide to talk about any such conflict before they speak on the floor of the house be not sure that this have direct impact on proceeding but the right hon gentleman point have be note again and again the conservatives be divide work people and pensioner and that be disgraceful in conclusion mean test the winter fuel payment be difficult decision interruption receive no funding from aslef so the right hon gentleman can withdraw his comment we be target support at the poor pensioner boost the uptake of pension credit maintain the triple lock for pensioner extend the household support fund and the warm home discount and in the long term introduce warm home plan to insulate people home these be the right decision to take this government be determine the fix the foundation of our economy so that we can deliver the change on which we be elect and which this country and our pensioner so desperately need bring down nhs waiting time claim to move the closure

christian wakeford jim mcmahon the house divide ayes noes question accordingly negative dynamic ticket pricing motion make and question propose that this house do now owatemi welcome the minister to his place and very much look forward to work with he to promote our world class creative industry include our music industry and all the other fantastic sector that his department promote today want to talk about music ticket and recognise the remarkable circumstance that have provoke this debate news of the oasis reunion have dominate the news cycle for the last week or so but some might say for all the wrong reason what should have be moment to celebrate one of the uk most significant cultural export and the chance to revisit the music that for many include be the soundtrack to our youth have morph into conversation about exploitative practice in the music industry that hurt fan and the grassroots sector some of the issue have be rumble away for year in fact early this year the select committee on culture media and sport publish report on grassroots music that outline some of the major challenge face the live music ecosystem and suggest some way forward the minister know the fact on august some million people from country log on to digital queue to buy ticket to the oasis live reunion tour year after the band break up and year on from their seminal first album definitely maybe fan be lock in an online queue for up to hour and when many of they it seem almost at random make it to the front of the queue the ticket be in many case more than double the price that have be advertise the dynamic pricing mechanism employ by oasis their promoter and management via ticketmaster serve to increase the price of ticket in line with demand but in reality it result in kind of lucky dip game in which the price get bad and bad by no clear mechanism except the secret and opaque rule of computer algorithm in the hand of ticketmaster should declare an interest after four hour of queue have become wistful about the halcyon day of real life physical box office where we queue almost overnight to get our ticket but at least we could see the queue in front of we and we know how long we would have to wait commend the hon member for bring this debate she be right and many of my constituent experience the issue that she mention we understand the economic principle of supply and demand but we also understand the principle of price gouging for those who believe they would be charge one price to have just few moment to decide whether they would be prepare to pay double be unfair pressure we must always encourage free trade but we must also be mindful of consumer protection in strangford gosport or any part of this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland could not have say it well myself that be exactly what it be we understand the law of supply and demand but we also understand the law of transparency and fairness what be more once ticket purchaser be through to the payment screen fan realise that they only have very limited time to decide whether the hugely inflate price be worth pay someone compare the ticket purchase after such long wait to the dopamine rush of gambler the to price increase mean that the transaction be no long choice but more of an impulse buy have hear many people say that the dynamic pricing method be use effectively in other sector and that the technology be perfect demonstration of the dynamism of free market even within the music industry itself there be dispute as to whether dynamic pricing have place and be an acceptable way forward congratulate the hon lady on secure the debate be hop to secure debate on the subject myself but she beat to it there seem to be an issue about who be to blame for all of this no one be take responsibility for the issue of dynamic pricing ticketmaster be blame the management and artist and they be blame those who be promote the event as she be now the chair of the culture media and sport committee will she look into this on behalf of the house and find out exactly why this have happen with view to have it stop and outlaw entirely be very fortunate to have be re elect as the chair of the culture media and sport committee but we do not have any member of the committee yet any decision about what the committee will look at will very much be group decision jointly take but this be certainly something will be put forward know the minister have already announce some consultation of his own to return to dynamic pricing and the law of supply and demand mention by the hon member for strangford jim shannon this be something that be use across different marketplace uber employ smart dynamic pricing mechanism that adjust the cost of journey in line with change variable such as traffic and current rider to driver demand hotel and airline be another market that use dynamic pricing but they be very different if people be stick at waterloo station as sometimes be an uber be not the only option of travel and when people go on holiday multiple airline offer flight to the same city and different hotel option but when it come to live music particularly in case such as this one there be one artist and one opportunity to buy ticket the imperfection of the dynamic pricing mechanism be obvious to anybody who attempt to buy ticket on this occasion but whatever the right and wrong of its suitability for music ticket and this market place the most important issue be that fan be not warn about the use of dynamic pricing before they enter the digital queue those be the fault that lead the competition and markets authority to open its investigation into this debacle it mean that people have no idea how much ticket would cost when they log in many fan end up pay at least double the original listing price of so four stand ticket could cost an eye watering once service and order processing fee be include the cma say that it will investigate whether fan be give clear and timely information any free market economist would call this classic case of information asymmetry there be certainly lack of clarity over how high ticket price might eventually go with the additional chaos of time limit put pressure on fan to make an imminent decision about whether they be go to buy ticketmaster claim that the dynamic pricing mechanism be the good way to deter ticket tout the logic be that any tout buy ticket in bulk would increase demand and therefore see his or her price and margin slash the guardian have already say that secondary ticketing platform be advertise more than ticket for this tour already include from one tout who claim to have at least ticket for cardiff wembley and murrayfield list for combine price of over be glad that this summer the government announce consultation on the secondary ticketing market where ticket be sell in bulk by tout who often use bot to scout for ticket at face value and sell they well beyond the market value but will the minister set out the parameter and timescale for the work when will it happen and what be it likely to include he have now announce that the investigation will be widen to consider dynamic pricing and what happen in the oasis situation so can we have reassurance that the eye will not be take off the ball of the original consultation that he announce in the summer there be so many aspect at play this method of resale be also the culprit for large amount of money lose to fraud with lloyd estimate that million be lose to scammer during taylor swift era tour alone will the minister tell whether the secondary market consultation will include conversation with digital search engine that be signpost customer into the hand of tout and not do enough to get they direct to principal sale site there be scope for an entire primary market review and for ticket to be review on much wide scale the oasis episode have open the eye of fan to potential anti competitiveness within the industry as complaint about the ticketing process begin to flood in oasis say it be their management and promoter who have agree dynamic pricing strategy with ticketmaster but of course their three tour promoter all have link to live nation ticketmaster parent company and in effect they be all the same party so that party be make money hand over fist through the system which keep everything under the live nation umbrella for typical tour live nation subsidiary promoter might take of the face value of ticket service charge of perhaps quarter of that face value will then be apply and some of that money will be go to live nation own ticketmaster the venue will take cut at this stage which in all likelihood will be live nation own venue too as it own festival and venue uk wide the process be repeat at resale if people go through ticketmaster at high cost than before leave live nation with an even great cut the minister do not need to be public intellectual to see that there be real perverse incentive for ticketmaster to see ticket in the hand of tout he will know that the us department of justice have slap live nation with lawsuit cite anti competitive conduct while it be now well establish that the company have near monopoly in the uk dynamic pricing be quite an effective way of reward near monopoly with no upper limit on ticket price mean great cut for the parent company the great sadness of all this be not only that the system be punish the fan in this case those oasis fan for whom the music be so totemic so life change back in the but that to add insult to injury there be no trickle down to the live music ecosystem like the grassroots music venue that oasis first play in while hone their skill the venue that make they such the boardwalk in manchester and king tut in glasgow although oasis have since announce further tour date ticket to new date will be sell at face value via invitation only ballot can not help feel that the fan who pay through the nose via dynamic pricing be go to feel very hard do by encourage the minister to look at way to amplify fan voice within the live music ecosystem he might start by respond to the culture media and sport committee report into grassroots music which have already mention it be publish in may know that we have have the small matter of general election since then but would like to know when the response be likely to be forthcoming and whether the government be minded to accept its recommendation the recommendation include one for fan lead review of music something like the fan lead review of football that be lead by my still friend my former hon friend the former member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch to look at how the music pyramid function and how the money trickle down from the big player to those small venue and fledgling songwriter and artist the recommendation include target vat cut which to grassroots venue would have represent final hour of salvation in sector that be widely accept to be in crisis and live music levy which would take small proportion of the service fee from the pocket of the big venue and bring they right down to the struggle business at the grassroot what be most pertinent to about all this be that while many of the venue and festival in which live nation own stake be flourish grassroots music venue be close at rate of two week be sure that the minister be aware that of the music venue in which oasis play on their first tour back in only be still open today and those venue be so crucial they be absolutely fundamental to incubate our world renowne talent they be the department for the music industry they be massive feeder into something that be fundamental to the uk economy and crucial to our soft power around the world in ticketing market go wrong there might have be gram of comfort to some of the fan pay through the nose for their ticket if they know that in pay it some of the money be protect grassroots music venue in their community and germinate the oasis of the future know that like the minister want nothing more than to see our musical talent continue to thrill fan both at home and around the world but behind every great act be chance performance at low capacity venue that be struggle to keep the light on that be at financial breaking point and that be hair breadth away from close its door call the minister it be particular delight to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker have not have an opportunity to congratulate you on your election hurrah it be also great delight to see the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage and to congratulate she on her election not many tories have be elect to many thing this year but it be great delight to see that she be return as the chair of the select committee on culture media and sport she know lot about this subject and have devote lot of her time and energy to it and look forward to work with she be sure there will be time when she have cross word with but sometimes cross word make government well that be certainly my policy when be sit on the opposition side of the house so be sure that what be good for the goose be good for the gander live event be really important to the british creative economy and to the whole economy in the uk it be the joy that they bring be sorry to start with kylie reference well actually be not but would defy anybody to have go to the kylie concert in hyde park this summer and not come away bounce with joy and full of the joy of spring it be beautiful it be amazing it be thousand and thousand of people in royal park enjoy themselves and celebrate for other who go the night before it be stevie nicks in completely different vein but none the less provide that same sense of joy that be an important part of what live event can do that sense of be part of an enormous crowd of people enjoy either sing along or listen and that special sense of be together live music be really important to our economy remember it must be year ago now be in newcastle sam fender be perform at st james park and we go to see who be on at the stadium of light that must have bring million of pound into the local economy it be certainly an awful lot of money for the local hotel down in cardiff we have lot of concert which many people from the south wales valley go to and people come from all over the world when springsteen be there early this year cardiff basically have to be close off but the knock on for the hotel the bar and the hospitality industry be really significant it be also significant for tourism for which be also the minister it be reckon that people in the uk work in the live event industry last year and it be an important part of what we do it be part of the reason many people want to come to the uk if may gently say so one of the thing we would like to sort out be british act be able to tour elsewhere in europe but it be good that europeans be able to come here to see some of our act the hon lady make really important point that this issue be not just about very big venue it be about small venue as well and do have anxiety about the state of play for many of they some of those problem be share with the whole of the hospitality industry incidentally skill staffing the cost of fuel security and so on but it be simple fact as she point out and as her select committee have point out that there have be far too many closure over recent year we stand ready to do what we possibly can to try to slow down if not halt that process of closure because she be right if an act do not have somewhere to start with capacity of or or how will they ever grow to end up fill wembley or any of the arena we have be talk about the value in live event be create by the artist the fan and the venue it be combination of the three it be not create by ticket tout and it be that combination that we really have to work on the hon lady be absolutely right that ticketing have change remember once when be in saint petersburg or leningrad as it be then that be how old be go to buy ticket for the opera and we buy ticket that be roll up in little peg hole that be what ticketing system use to be that be what theatre use to have in the uk then we change over to system of have physical ticket that we present many of we have keep all our ticket for all the show we have ever be to know friend who have collection of orchestral manoeuvres in the dark ticket through the year and so on now of course we have completely online digital system that be great in many way it can be easy and enhance security but it can also be much more difficult and have produce whole set of new challenge for fan artist and venue to make the market work effectively barcode qr code and all the rest of it transfer ticket from one person to another different app develop by different venue and so on there be very new challenge first there be security to which the hon lady refer and someone get the ticket that they actually pay for rather than ticket that do not exist in the first place we have all hear hideous example of that and it be an embarrassment for we all that over recent year we have see so few prosecution in that area despite the fact that nearly all of we can cite instance of constituent fall prey to those who be effectively sell ticket that they think they might be able to buy online but do not possess people then turn up to the venue and find that their ticket be not be honour because they be not ticket in the first place that be security issue in the modern market there be also fairness issue the hon lady point out the experience of people log on at and sit there for hour and hour it be system in which we have no idea how somebody get to be number rather than in the queue it seem completely and utterly random but one suspect that there might be clever mean by which people who have deep pocket and know how to navigate the system be able to manipulate it it be clear that there be many instance of bot effectively hoover up large number of ticket use lot of different id credit card and the rest of it that be an issue of fairness be everybody queue fairly or not then there be the question of transparency online site be not as open as they might be about the real or original cost the face value cost of the ticket that they then sell for different price some people say to well it say fv and all you have to do be click on the fv but why do site not make the face value immediately obvious let give the house one instance of inflated pricing which be much more excessive in the secondary market than the hon lady say if someone who want to see dua lipa at the royal albert hall on october visit the viagogo site they can either buy ticket with face value of for do not know why it be cite in euro or they can buy ticket with face value of for or and this be my favourite they can buy for ticket that have face value of as the hon lady rightly say not single penny of the difference between and will go to the artist the venue the clean or lighting expert in the venue the person who write the song that dua lipa will sing or the fan it be simply go to viagogo and think that that be unfair it be not right it be inappropriate know dozen and dozen of artist who be utterly embarrassed about the situation in which they find themselves and they want we to act in this sphere rise of course give way to one of our lead musician we be delighted that the minister be on top of this and know about the issue and difficulty but we be more interested to hear in the time that he have leave about what he will do to resolve it there have be report from the competition and markets authority and the select committee of the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage will the government look at they constructively and bring in legislation so that this be no long feature of live ticket sale the hon gentleman be terribly impatient man be just come that interruption no we have until he be right that we must take action on the secondary ticketing market and we commit ourselves to do so during the general election we believe that those people be deny true fan the opportunity to buy ticket on the primary market and be pocket any profit for themselves as say very little of the additional revenue actually go to artist venue or anyone work in the live venue sector more generally the government be commit to put fan back at the heart of live event and to clamp down on unfair practice in the secondary ticketing market that be why we have commit to introduce new protection for consumer on ticket resale and we will be launch consultation in the autumn to find the good way to address ongoing problem on the resale market the consultation will consider range of option include revisit recommendation from the competition and markets authority report such as put limitation on the price of ticket list for resale over the face value limit the number of ticket that individual reseller can list to the number of ticket that they can legitimately buy via the original platform make platform accountable for the accuracy of information about ticket that they list for sale and ensure that the cma have the power that it need to take swift decisive action against platform and tout to protect consumer we want live event ticket to work for uk fan would say that the market be make for humanity not humanity for the market and sometimes government need to intervene to ensure that the market do indeed work for humanity as an oasis fan too be queue endlessly and it prove to that badly regulate market have no morality the conclusion from the dynamic pricing policy in that incident be that people with more money or tout could get those ticket speak as someone who play in rock band when be young man although none so famous and successful as that of the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart live music be universal in that it reach out to the soul of people of all background would be grateful for the minister view on what he can do to ensure that as many people as possible can get ticket for live music persuade people to do more gig guess obviously there be only so many ticket for certain event but what people want to have guarantee be that the market be not exclude they solely on the basis of price sometimes there be ballot for ticket as there be for wimbledon and gather that oasis have now introduce partial ballot for the next round of gig that be be advertise but we want to look at all these issue in the round should say something about the cma announcement like many member across the house know lot of people include my hon friend the member for rugby john slinger and the leader of the house with story about their process of try to buy ticket two weekend ago for the oasis reunion tour should point out that oasis only reunite under labour government in the light of the concern express by fan about the sale process we welcome the cma announcement that it have launch formal investigation into ticketmaster the cma have say that it be concerned that fan try to buy oasis ticket through ticketmaster may not have be give clear information about ticket price and have ask fan to share their experience its investigation will look at whether the sale of oasis ticket by ticketmaster may have breach consumer protection law other have great freedom in what they can say than do as minister this be live investigation and the cma be an independent law enforcement body and it be important to ensure that the independence and integrity of any investigation be protect so in order to avoid prejudice the process be not go to comment on that investigation look forward to read the cma finding and merely note that lot of people have say that they would like their money back follow recent event however the government will look at issue concern the transparency and use of dynamic pricing in the live event sector and we be carefully consider how that be take forward in the light of the cma announcement want to talk specifically about dynamic pricing for moment in general term dynamic pricing involve business adjust its price accord to change market condition such as high and low demand it be an established pricing strategy and it have be feature of our live event industry for some time at least in certain form as an example be sure that many member will have manage to snap up cut price ticket to popular west end show by purchase they on the day of the event we be use to see organiser or venue slash their price in that way in order to fill the few remain seat it be also common to see early bird ticket release at low price punter essentially receive discount on full price ticket for an event by buy their ticket within certain period after they go on sale or until limited batch have be sell glastonbury do that wigmore hall do that for people who be sign up to its programme and for that matter the rhondda arts festival in treorchy also do that urge people to look online and buy some ticket for next year in both of those scenario there be fan who benefit from well deal than they might otherwise have be able to secure have they buy their ticket at another time equally there will be other fan who buy their ticket at another time and have to pay different or indeed high price hon member will have their own view on all this but suggest it be trade off that most people be accustom to and one that we can generally accept motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now owatemi we would not want half empty venue despite look around the chamber due to ticket be price too high nor venue and festival that be not economically sustainable what we should not accept however be very clear about this as be the government be practice that see fan of live event blindside by price hike either because they be not provide with the right information up front or because that information be not provide clearly enough do so might be in breach of exist consumer law which require business to be fair and transparent in their dealing with consumer it be the responsibility of the cma to investigate potential breach of consumer law arise from or involve the use of dynamic pricing method and to take enforcement action where appropriate have already refer to its investigation in this case it be the responsibility of government however to confront the wide policy question around the use of dynamic pricing for ticket to live event we have already say that we will look at this issue far to establish whether consumer be adequately protect under exist law or whether more need to be do the hon member for gosport ask whether this mean that we be go to take our eye off the ball on the secondary ticketing market it do not we be very clear we have set of manifesto commitment and we will bring out our consultation this autumn once we have complete that consultation we expect to take the necessary action that we commit to in our general election manifesto since most of that action be in line with what the select committee be advocate before the general election hope we might still enjoy the committee support for it the hon lady be right that we will also be look at website that be part of the whole panoply of action she also effectively refer to vertical integration within the ticketing system of course that have to be part of our consideration because it be another part of make sure that the market work for humanity for fan artist and the creative industry rather than all of we have to operate as slave of the market the prime minister have say that we be commit to put fan at the heart of music and end extortionate resale as have say we will launch consultation this autumn to work out how good we can do that that consultation will look at ticket for live event and call for evidence on the topic of price transparency include dynamic pricing will be send out that will help we understand the need of fan and the live event industry to be absolutely clear with the house and the hon lady that will be about ticket for live event not the whole of dynamic pricing across all industry in the uk the hon lady ask when we will respond to the grassroot venue report from may we have be get our foot under the table as fast as we possibly can and be very eager to respond to that report in swift order take the responsibility of select committees very seriously sit on the culture media and sport committee from to it be one of the most important thing have do as member of parliament so we will respond as soon as we can it will certainly be in the autumn and would like it to be as soon as possible after the committee be fully form in conclusion would like to thank the hon lady for secure this debate be not allow to refer to what she try to get as urgent question but have now we have world class live event sector in the uk and be absolutely determined that fan have every opportunity to experience it at first hand there be nothing well than someone stand in an audience in crowd along with hundred of other people either experience an artist they have never see before and suddenly realise my god that just pierce right through to my heart or go to see somebody they have see time before have listen to the album time in the past week and have that joyful moment they will be different artist for every single one of we but want far more people in this country to be able to enjoy that opportunity want every child to have creative education and want they to have the opportunity that so many other enjoy in my constituency and every other acknowledge that dynamic pricing can help match supply with demand result in both high and low price but when it be use as business model it need to be transparent and fair and that be what we want to ensure it be wonderful to hear from two musician and sir chris bryant have give away his true old age question put and agree to house adjourn
