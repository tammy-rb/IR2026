significant impact on our understanding of the people of these isle before there be an england scotland wales or northern ireland let move on from the century over the come year the city would continue to flourish and establish itself as religious and ecumenical centre although much of the surround area maintain its rural and agrarian aspect for many century to come in this time the area do produce innumerable great life and while they be far too numerous to mention all of they here should note gregory king the world first economic statistician elias ashmole whose collection found the

success story in sophie capewell lichfield golden girl bring home not just gold medal from paris this year but world record as part of team gbs fantastic effort in do so she end my reign as the most successful former pupil of my old school nether stowe in lichfield and although have hop to hold that title little long than day be happy to be disappoint on that point return to my historical tour of lichfield and its surround area we reach the early and century and the town of burntwood conurbation of mining village which grow up some four mile from lichfield and have similarly proud history its most notable resident be the fundraiser and campaigner stephen sutton who raise million for the teenage cancer trust despite his diagnosis we lose he far too soon at the age of just he be make an mbe for his fundraising so it be more than fitting that burntwood town council remember he through student award name in his honour not to be outshone by the cathedral down the road burntwood also take its place in ecclesiastical history when in st anne church in chasetown become the first in the country to have electric lighting today the people of burntwood still maintain close knit community typical of former mining area that be show by the great example of the spark café and burntwood be friend which have do so much to step in to replace service cut during long year of conservative government if we be discuss burntwood we can not forget the giant kill exploit of chasetown fc in the fa cup of at some point will forgive the members for cardiff burntwood be not the only part of my constituency that have mining history the village of handsacre also more than play its part in power the industry of the and century it be also the village where my old man teach his first lesson as probationary teacher in the as for the suggestion that his geordie accent be in part responsible for his hiring in school build to teach the child of new arrival from the north east that remain suspect if unconfirmed mining be not the only industry that find its way to my part of staffordshire many of we will recognise the name armitage shanks but few will know its link to the village of armitage just short trip up rugeley road from handsacre as the new government focus their legislative agenda on growth remind colleague that while many of we may have already spend penny with armitage shanks they be all welcome to visit and spend many more in the come year all this industry mean that the canal come to my constituency the coventry canal and the trent and mersey canal be still navigable today and the work of the lichfield and hatherton canal restoration trust should be commend as it aim to restore that link as green and blue way over the come year have touch again on transport will complete the circle and return to the crossroad that make letocetum watle street or the as it be now know and rykneld street the be major transport artery that link my constituency together and link it easily to the rest of the country the in particular have help to establish logistic centre in the village of fradley on the site of the former raf lichfield fan of the bbc bargain hunt will know fradley well give the regular appearance of richard winterton and his auctioneer on that show hope that can get as much airtime as they do slightly far up the be the national memorial arboretum near alrewas wonderful venue as the site of national remembrance advise every single person to make visit there to remember not just in november but on any day be sure that in the come month the secretary of state for transport will grow tired of my lobbying about the need for railway station to serve that amazing location on dissimilar note the first travelodge in the uk be open slightly up the road some year ago near the village of barton under needwood although that village should be much well remember as the home of the holland tug of war team found in the team have represent england at numerous international tournament and even bring home silver medal from the world open championship it be to this constituency that will return during the recess look forward to speak to my constituent about transport access to healthcare education health and care plan and many other issue that be on their lip look forward to bring those story back to this place so that can continue to
