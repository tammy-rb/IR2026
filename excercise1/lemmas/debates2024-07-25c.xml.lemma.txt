my neighbour but he be represent place that be really close to my heart be incredibly proud to be make my maiden speech as the new member of parliament for ipswich however this be not my first contribution in this house yesterday ask question at pmq highlight the huge potential that ipswich possess but say that after year of neglect we desperately need government support to help revive our town centre however corner of social medium instead focus on very gentle joke have make when point out that my home county of suffolk once again have premier league football team unlike our friend north of the border in norfolk one keyboard warrior in particular take umbrage at that his name be ed balls and apparently he use to work here he say that norwich have have year unbeaten run in the old farm derby run that will now sadly be extend due to ipswich be promote to the premier league and norwich get knock out in the play off last season be sure that that will be bitter pill for town fan to swallow as they visit anfield the tottenham hotspur stadium the etihad and old trafford next season ed tweet also represent my most significant celebrity beef on social medium since steve brookstein yes the first winner of the factor nearly decade ago ipswich have rich and long history so rich and long in fact that be go to use this as an opportunity to settle an old score now that colchester have vacate its town status be lay claim to ipswich be the old continuous town in england no have not check that with the house of commons library as might have be give an answer that do not want to hear but two minute of search online tell that have decent chance of be right and presume that as be now state it as fact in parliament it now become true thomas wolsey be arguably ipswich most famous son and we in ipswich have be celebrate his legacy throughout the past year through the wolsey wolsey do not always get the praise he deserve climb the greasy pole will not win you many friend something to which member of this house will attest be sure however his story rise from humble beginning to become one of the most powerful statesman in england be remarkable and he leave his imprint on our town too ipswich can also lay claim to ralph fiennes constance andrews thomas gainsborough jean ingelow brian eno edith cook and even richard ayoade to name but few my job over the come year will be ensure that kid grow up in ipswich today get their chance to make their dream reality so that when my successor come to make their maiden speech they have few more name to mention too would also like to mention my predecessor tom hunt while an mp tom often speak about be neurodiverse and be open about challenge that he face grow up he look to tackle some of the stigma that still exist and that be an incredibly powerful thing for member of parliament to do on election night tom charitably mention our share commitment to improve the life of child with special educational need and disability an issue that have campaign on for many year in suffolk will now use my role to fight for those family here in westminster the send crisis be national issue and know many colleague from across the house will have hear countless story about the struggle that family have have to endure to access the service that should be theirs in suffolk we have have decade of the most grotesque and repeat failure remember five year ago after another damn report the front page of our local paper the east anglian daily times show the face of just some of the child and family who have be so badly fail by broken system with the heartbreaking desperate headline we must be hear as itv report show today so little have change half decade later those child and their family have still not be hear this be not just about the educational impact on child immense though they may be it be also about the exhaustion desperation and isolation that family suffer day in day out the month year even battle for an education health and care plan the time spend wait by the phone or checking email hop that they might finally get some positive news and the energy they have to find just to try to navigate this broken system fight through tribunal and submit mountain upon mountain of new documentation and information all while try to care for their family as labour government we can not let the suffering of vulnerable child and their family continue it will be my personal mission in this place to fight this inequality and injustice if can make one final plea on this issue as former teaching assistant and proud gmb mp urge that when we talk about the crisis in retention and recruitment of teacher we include specialist and support staff in the conversation they be crucial to break down barrier to opportunity too would like to touch on another subject that be incredibly important to the energy transition this be not just an environmental necessity but an economic imperative it can boost our economy reduce bill ensure great security and deliver the well pay job that we need with gb energy we will be able to achieve that if britain be to become world leader in this area as the labour party have pledge want ipswich and suffolk to be right at the heart of this national renewal why should we not be over the come year thousand of job will be create in new nuclear at sizewell in offshore wind and in solar be unapologetically ambitious for our town and our county do not want those job and that investment to drift away elsewhere want kid grow up in ipswich or people look to retrain and upskill to get those secure well pay job want local business to benefit from the billion of pound that will flow out of these project and want our area to be the centre of national excellence that be our future if we be brave enough to grasp it as labour and co operative member of parliament it be particularly welcome to that our commitment to community energy sit at the very heart of this mission the great ever expansion of community energy project deliver million new owner of energy will be genuinely transformational and as proud co operative party mp will champion the growth of such project so that local people will benefit from our green transition too many of we be just few week into our new role and as this debate be about second job will be honest in my contribution and say that have no idea why or how any member of parliament would have second job we all know what be talk about to be the member of parliament for ipswich be the great privilege of my life but to be frank it be not like any other job think about ipswich and its beautiful award win park its waterfront look absolutely glorious on sunny day the music festival that we have now which would have love to have be to as teenager be only slightly old now than be then and the fact that our town once again have premier league football club might have mention that already think about suffolk too the place move to year ago still hang out with my friend from debenham high school still play for the same cricket club the mighty eye and district cricket club my batting just as terrible and my bowling just as slow if not slow still want to walk around fram castle and along the beach of southwold aldeburgh and dunwich still pop into coes family business found nearly year ago and love nothing well than eat at the lighthouse restaurant or drink an adnams or an aspall in the woolpack or the greyhound be still surround by my friend here my family and my neighbour not to mention million happy memory have be shape and inspire by they for nearly quarter of century have no doubt that will make some mistake along the way and know that there will be some time when my constituent disagree with but know that everything that do here will be out of service friendship and love for my home ipswich and suffolk join other in welcome you to your place madam deputy speaker thank you for give the chance to make my maiden speech and to contribute to this important debate on second job speak for the people of spelthorne pay tribute to all member who have make their maiden speech in particular my immediate predecessor the hon member for ipswich jack abbott he be clearly go to be fearsome and fearless advocate for his constituent base purely on the fact that he be prepared to risk the opprobrium of the people of colchester the people of norwich and perhaps most impressively of all mr ed balls congratulate he thank the house staff for the impeccable welcome that they give we all as new member be for quite long time soldier so be bring up on the mantra that two minute early be three minute late it be therefore no surprise that at five minute to on the monday after the election be the first in the queue at the top of the ramp see two armed police officer but there be also doorkeeper resplendent in his uniform of morning coat and gold badge and his beard not know what to expect approach he he say good morning mr jopp be beyond impressed he continue you might not recognise under this beard sir but matt and be with you in the scots guards in afghanistan go from be impressed to be deeply touch have have the chance to listen to large number of maiden speech have notice that when the name of the member and their constituency flash up on the screen that be sometimes meet with knowing smile and sometimes not depend on the name of the seat it be like that excellent episode of yes prime minister when jim hacker and sir humphrey appleby start discuss somewhere call st george island both of they suggest that they have some form of superior insight into st george island but it quickly become apparent that neither of they have any idea where on earth it be lest my maiden speech become something like that think that ought to tell the house where spelthorne be spelthorne be everything south of heathrow airport until the thames we be in the administrative county of surrey and the historic county of middlesex we be inside the but not in london crazily you can use an oyster card to take london bus there but not the train we be outside the clutch of the mayor of london dread ultra low emission zone charge but accord to the church of england we report to the bishop of kensington hon member might think that all those special circumstance would give rise to something of an identity crisis for the people of spelthorne but not bit of it because no one who live there actually call it spelthorne anyway instead people say they live in staines stanwell or stanwell moor in ashford shepperton or laleham in halliford charlton village or sunbury by the way all hon member sit in parliament today be here thank to notable resident of stanwell thomas later lord knyvet it be he whom the king dispatch to search the cellar beneath parliament result in the capture of the treacherous gunpowder plotter clearly lord knyvet ability to navigate this place be great deal well than mine pay full tribute to my immediate predecessor as member of parliament for spelthorne kwasi kwarteng who have represent the constituency since hon member will not be surprised to hear that his name come up frequently on the doorstep in the last general election kwasi be much respect back bencher and minister as well as be charismatic performer in this chamber strong advocate for small business in spelthorne he instigate the spelthorne business plan competition now in its year spelthorne people be some of the hard work people in the country so it be appropriate that should be make this speech in debate on second job many of my constituent have they too have have selection of job as friend of mine recently remark blimey lincoln year in the army and year in private equity where do you see more violence now be in parliament with the huge honour of represent the people of spelthorne and be strike by just how important that be particularly at the moment be sure that all member want to be strong voice for their constituent and local champion for their area and do too passionately however we be also here to fulfil our second job to make thoughtful contribution to the national and international debate on issue of great moment none of which be more important in my view than the defence of the realm give that the world be the most dangerous it have be since the end of the cold war we be have defence review which will take time but time may be run out and the right course of action increase defence expenditure be all too clear now let alone in month time when the review report gently suggest to all member of this house that to govern may be to choose but it be also to act and that the answer to autocracy be rarely more bureaucracy to finish on light note hope that hon member now know little bit more about spelthorne they be welcome to visit any time whether to hear about the work of bp global technology centre as it seek to decarbonise the world or to see the large film studio in europe and the second big in the world after hollywood they might instead be interested in flutter on the horse at kempton park not that we on the conservative side of the house be allow to bet any more or maybe just to potter along the thames like three men in boat madam deputy speaker say would finish and do not make promise can not keep make one promise to the people of spelthorne it be that if they elect we would move to the constituency thank solely to the effort of my amazing wife caroline we pick up the key to our new
