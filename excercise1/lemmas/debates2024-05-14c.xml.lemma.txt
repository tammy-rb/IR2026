oral answers to questions justice the secretary of state be ask child remand in custody what recent assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the number of child be remand to custody custody be reserve for those convict or accuse of the most grave offence and the total number of child in detention have fall by since before child can be remand the court must be satisfied that it be very likely that the defendant will receive custodial sentence and must have explicitly consider and reject the option of remand he or she into local authority care some of place in youth custody be take up by child and young people on remand who do not go on to receive custodial sentence yet child hold in young offender institution spend most of their time lock up in their cell amid high level of violence do the minister think that that be the good place to spend time during adolescence the hon lady make an important and compassionate point it be absolutely right that we should invest in the estate and be pleased that we be invest in new secure school which will open soon she make an important point about the decision to remand those decision be make by independent judge that be correct but hope that she will join in recognise that the reduction in the overall number of child in custody by since be positive thing when be prosecute young people be go inside for be passenger in vehicle take without consent now they be inside only for the most grave offence will the lord chancellor take into consideration one of the recommendation of the wade report on sentencing for murder the definition of child should be reconsider at the moment someone who be or very often might be try when they be but they be sentence as if they be child surely the question should be the crime rather than the age we have alter the sentencing regime such that the court can take into account what can be quite significant gap between the sentencing regime that apply to year old and that which apply to an year old the court now have additional discretion to ensure that if somebody be very close to their birthday they can be treat as more mature which can mean in appropriate case that the punishment will be more severe call the shadow minister almost two third of child on remand in youth detention do not go on to receive custodial sentence and be acquit mean that they be free from criminal charge altogether it cost between and per year to keep just one child on remand in youth custody do the minister view that as the good use of public money or do he feel that it could be manage in more efficient and effective way with an alternative remand provision in the total number of child in custody be over that figure be now around so there have be significant reduction the decision of whether to remand be matter for the judge they can remand in custody only if there be substantial ground for believe that if release on bail the child will commit further offence or indeed fail to surrender we be also invest million of pound in greater manchester for example to see whether there be other option in remand child into local authority accommodation and not necessarily into custody public confidence in victim support what step his department be take to help ensure public confidence in the support provide to victim throughout the criminal justice process what step his department be take to help ensure public confidence in the support provide to victim throughout the criminal justice process with the victims and prisoners bill we be put the victim code on statutory footing it include right for any victim of crime to be signpost by the police to correct and appropriate support service we have quadruple victim fund since we take office in to over million year and

hotline for rape rapist domestic abuser and stalker can not be convict if trial be not go ahead and victim be drop out after be make to wait year for justice where be the government plan to tackle the record court backlog which be make victim wait year for justice we be do huge amount to drive down the backlog which be principally result of the pandemic we have increase the fee for both solicitor and barrister by we have keep open more than nightingale court and we be do everything within our power to drive down waiting time bear in mind that harrow crown court be not set to reopen for another year because of ministers failure to invest in its repair early enough what confidence can victim of crime in harrow have that ministers be go to get those who be accuse of those crime to justice much more quickly than be currently the case as the hon gentleman will know the issue with harrow crown court be that reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete be discover in that building we be invest more than million in the court estate because we know how much it matter not just so that the court be function but so that the building convey the right sense of dignity so that people respect the process harrow be just one of court in england and wales call the chair of the select committee the minister be right to recognise the work that be be do on the victim code and appreciate the government take on board number of the recommendation make by the justice committee when we engage in pre legislative scrutiny of that bill the minister will know however that there be particular issue with delay in case of rape and serious sexual offence where case be take out of the list because prosecute counsel be not available they simply can not be find she rightly refer to the increase in fee for solicitor and defence counsel do she agree that there be now just one piece of the jigsaw that need to be put in place to bring the fee for prosecute counsel in those case up to the same level as those for defence counsel that would take about million will she sit down with the attorney general and talk with she about how we can do that swiftly can reassure my hon and learn friend the chair of the select committee that speak to the chair of the bar council about exactly that issue last week but want to provide he with further reassurance first there have be correspondence between the lord chancellor and the senior preside judge about any case of rape that be more than two year old that correspondence be couple of month old and he say that all case would be list by july this year that apply to case in england and wales also want to draw my hon and learn friend attention to something know he will be aware of that we have increase the fee for section hearing which take place in an irregular sequence in the court listing from to over on monday the daily telegraph report that civil servant be try to block an amendment to the criminal justice bill that would legislate for the publication of an annual report on crime stat by nationality do the minister support the release of such report and what do she think civil servant be worried we will find out it be time to publish report and restore trust among the general public thank my hon friend for her question be not aware of that but know that an amendment have be suggest that be not within the scope of the bill my hon friend suggestion be sensible one we already publish the number of foreign national offender in prison but understand the force of her question and be happy to meet she to discuss it far more than lawyer campaigner politician and academic have write letter in support of the anti violence against woman and girl campaigner and barrister dr charlotte proudman who be face disciplinary action after challenge judge for take boy club attitude in ruling on domestic abuse case do the minister agree that the racial gender and class base bias of the justice system must be address and that it be right to speak up against injustice will she join in pay tribute to those who be campaign for legal sector that genuinely represent empower and be accountable to the wide public count myself as one of the people who campaign on violence against woman and there be many other right hon and hon member across this house who do the same thing the hon lady will understand hope why will not get involve in disciplinary matter concern particular barrister know what it be say have be say and it will be for the relevant standard committee to decide whether or not the barrister be at fault the minister may be aware that use to be the victim minister and when be in that role try to stand up for victim whose love one have be kill by road traffic incident it be fundamentally unfair that if someone be charge with death by careless driving as compare with death by dangerous driving the case be not appealable by the victim for leniency be that something we be still look at as be the case when be in the ministry share my right hon friend profound concern about death cause by either dangerous or careless driving as he know it be the conservative government who create criminal offence of death by careless driving will just make two point first on june the maximum penalty for the offence of death by dangerous driving be increase to life previously it be year secondly we have just agree to extend the unduly lenient sentence scheme so that the complainant will have day to put in their appeal to the attorney general and the solicitor general who will have further day to contact the court we hope that that will encourage more application and of course we keep the category of offence under careful review call the shadow minister victim should have the right to know who this government be let out of jail early with today news that despite ministers protestation to the contrary from the dispatch box high risk offender have be release early why should the public have any confidence that this be government who put victim first want to provide some reassurance to the shadow minister under our scheme no sexual offender no terrorist offender and nobody who have be convict of serious violent crime or be convict for four year or more will be eligible for early release would just remind he that the slight distinction between our scheme and that conduct under the last labour government between and be that we have governor lock that mean that the governor of any prison can prevent an individual prisoner from be release early if they do not think that it be suitable to do so and that be not the case under the last labour report may vol correction employment tribunal panels what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of propose reform to employment tribunal panel the employment tribunal panel composition arrangement be now responsibility of the senior president of tribunals and understand that he intend to publish the response to the consultation on propose reform shortly he have statutory duty to consult my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor before make these arrangement and my noble and learn friend the parliamentary under secretary of state for justice will be meet the senior president of tribunals think tomorrow to discuss his proposal as part of that duty the introduction of tribunal fee previously lead to drop in the number of case go forward and the scheme be deem unlawful by the supreme court so it beggar belief that the government be look at reintroduce tribunal fee and give green light to bad employer to exploit worker who will be deter from come forward what do the minister say to the organisation include the tuc citizens advice the joseph rowntree foundation and liberty that be call on the government to reconsider the reintroduction of tribunal fee thank the hon member for his question many of these issue be raise when the statutory instrument pass through parliament the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for finchley and golders green mike freer who be the court minister have write to the senior president of tribunals to convey those concern and think that be in part why my noble and learn friend be meet the senior president of tribunals report may vol correction call the shadow minister the wheel of justice certainly turn slowly under this government and hundred of thousand of people across the country be pay the price in the crown court the civil court the family court and tribunal at the end of the employment tribunal backlog stand at more than case those be case affect worker who have be bully worker who have be deny pay and worker who have be unfairly dismiss do the minister think that worker like the government should just give up on the justice system roll over and accept what employer do to they or be there new magic formula to sort this out the one thing the hon gentleman do not of course mention be the impact of the pandemic on the criminal justice system and indeed on the employment tribunal system hon member oh come on opposition front bencher do not like hear it but they can not deny the impact of shut down the system in effect for two year we have massively increase the resource available and we be work through the backlog but that will take time call the snp spokesperson on similar point in cost of living crisis worker be now expect to pay to take their employer to an employment tribunal in case of wage theft unpaid redundancy pay and compensation for unfair dismissal quite frankly it be outrageous that this be be levy at time of intense pressure on family budget do the government not agree that access to justice must never be contingent on one ability to pay and that these propose change ought to be scrap to promote great fairness in the system thank the hon member for his question we have introduce regional virtual court to safeguard access to justice and we will always make that available as far as it be possible to do so as say we be work through the backlog at pace rwanda asylum and immigration if he will issue guidance to lawyer on the potential implication for the criminal justice process of the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act the hon lady ask about the implication for the criminal justice system of the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act to be clear that act relate to immigration and potentially administrative law it do not substantially impact on the criminal law and accordingly no specific guidance be require thank the secretary of state for that response may praise the quick response from solicitor and the community in glasgow to rwanda removal very much in the spirit of the glasgow girls and the glasgow grannies and kenmure street three year ago be there deliberate policy to remove people from scotland to england to prevent they from access legal aid as they would be able and fully entitle to do in scotland what guidance have be issue to lawyer in this respect lastly what right do mps have to intervene in case of removal because have be tell that mps have be ask for wet signature from people who have be take to immigration removal centre in england there be several question in there but the answer to the first question be no that be not correct the point about legal advice be very important people should get legal advice so that they can make their point that be why we be invest heavily when the illegal migration act come into force there will be uplift we have invest million to reaccredit senior caseworker and we be also pay for travel time we recognise that the legislation be necessarily robust and we be also ensure people get the legal advice they need call scottish national party spokesperson listen with great interest to that answer my hon friend the members for glasgow central alison thewliss and for glasgow north east anne mclaughlin and have constituent who have be remove from scotland to england and threaten with deportation can the secretary of state answer this question why be mp be deny access to their constituent it seem outrageous do he not agree that this be unacceptable and that lawyer and their elect representative should not be impede by arbitrary barrier when access constituent who be threaten with deportation would be more than happy to discuss that point with the hon gentleman of course mps should have access in appropriate circumstance but the critical point be for individual to get legal support say that with no discourtesy to he as constituency mp that legal support be important as have say when the ima come into effect we will increase funding by pay for travel time and ensure the reaccreditation of senior caseworker that be what individual need support through legal advice and that be what we be provide parc prison what recent assessment he have make of the welfare of prisoner at hmp parc be grateful to the hon lady for her question and also for she typically measure and sensitive contribution to yesterday urgent question on this issue ensure our prison be safe and secure for both staff and prisoner remain our top priority his majesty prison and probation service have be work closely with the operator of hmp parc to ensure the welfare of prisoner and visit last month to see the work for myself be particularly conscious of the importance of that in light of the nine death in hmp parc since march as the minister mention yesterday have the opportunity to raise in the house the very real concern of parent with son at parc particularly in relation to drug use when contact the prison two month ago it reply that in the year to september there have shockingly be incident of self harm in prison of inmate do the minister accept that parent have be ask particularly for mental health support for year and it have not be happen be grateful to the hon lady again for her question the provision of mental health support be absolutely vital it be obviously something that need to be do hand in hand and in partnership with the local health board in wales we continue to work closely with the health board both on the issue she have raise and more broadly on the issue underpin some of the challenge face in parc the minister will be aware of the dire indeed dangerous situation we face at chelmsford prison three year ago when the prison be place in special measure he may have see the late inspection report which praise the improvement especially in be safe and more productive place and the work do to take drug and contraband out of the prison thank the justice secretary personally for the focus he give this issue when he be prison minister and congratulate the governor and the staff do the minister agree that the lesson from chelmsford could help other prison such as parc and that with the right approach even the bad prison can be turn around be grateful to my right hon friend for her dexterity in ask her question she make very important point in pay tribute to the work that have be do at chelmsford prison by my right hon and learn friend the secretary of state work with the team and all the staff there also note the close interest she have take and how much that mean to the staff and the team at her local prison she rightly point out that there be opportunity to learn lesson from that which may well benefit prison such as parc child and young people reoffende what recent assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of reoffende rate among child and young people over the year to prove reoffende rate caution and conviction for child and young people have fall from to although there have be slight uptick over the past year the fact remain that reoffende by child and young people have fall significantly under this government last week see the powerful new play punch by james graham can not recommend it highly enough to all right hon and hon member who be welcome to come to nottingham playhouse to see it it raise important question about young man and their offend behaviour and shin light on the potential power of restorative justice what role do the minister believe restorative justice can and should play in tackle reoffende which as he say have rise for the first time in decade among adult and child be grateful to the hon lady not just for her question but for her kind invitation to visit nottingham playhouse it be just up the road from my constituency in leicestershire so might take she up on that in answer to her substantive question although decision on restorative justice be matter for judge there be relevant consideration to take into account see restorative justice as one element of package that can help to reduce reoffende and get child and young people who commit crime back on to the straight and narrow prison illegal drug what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of trend in the number of drug find in prison over the last five year the government take zero tolerance approach to drug in prison as be reflect in our policy approach which have see million worth of investment into measure to tackle the smuggling of contraband include drug into prison in the year end march there be few incident where drug be find than in the year to march reverse that pre pandemic trend there remain more to do but it be important to note that progress have be make the most recent report by hm inspectorate of prison into hmp parc in find that almost half of prisoner have easy access to drug and our current welsh affairs committee inquiry into prison have receive evidence regard drug use as well as the fact that parc be understaffed and staff be inexperienced in light of that evidence and the recent death and surge in record violence in parc prison would the minister welcome new inspection by the chief inspector give the million cost of the contract for to run the prison have he give consideration to the prison service step in to manage it as it have do with birmingham prison the hon lady make number of point in term of tackle drug in parc we have ray body scanner and the rapiscan system and we have handheld device be roll out in respect of her two specific question any inspection be matter for the chief inspector of prison in term of the overall performance of parc it be important to remember that although there be challenge which be address in the urgent question yesterday parc be rat as perform well and its contract be perform well in the inspection it get one measure of good and three of reasonably good there be more to do and we will continue to work with the prison but the contract continue to perform well call the shadow minister the government boast as they have do just now about their investment in new body scanner to detect drug on everyone enter prison each day yet damn report in the times find that the body scanner at hmp bedford be not even staff what be the point in spend million on scanner if they be not even use before turn to the substance of the hon lady question may take this opportunity to wish she happy birthday hon member hear hear it be important to remember that this investment be across the estate be in hmp wandsworth yesterday see the work be do there in the context of bedford the body scanner be use at appropriate time in an appropriate manner custodial and community sentencing if he will make comparative assessment of the effectiveness of short custodial sentence and sentence serve in the community ministry of justice reoffende statistic show that those serve sentence of six month or less have reoffending rate for offender punish with suspend sentence or community order the reoffende rate be the department analysis of match cohort of over offender show low reoffende rate for those serve sentence in the community when compare with immediate custody of less than month avoid ten of thousand of potential crime agree with the bishop of gloucester that community payback scheme be often far more appropriate than short term custodial sentence particularly for woman prisoner if my hon friend agree with that do he also agree that we could expand the range of community payback activity to include for example help at good local charity such as the nelson trust and the family haven and especially during this summer season of litter pick across the country keep britain tidy thank my hon friend for that sensible question agree that community payback offer offender an opportunity to make visible reparation to their local community with million of hour be deliver each year as an example this march for the great british spring clean offender spend thousand of hour clearing litter across the country we be trialle new way to deliver community payback through the rapid deployment pilot which be launch last year community payback team be work in partnership with local authority to see incident clean up within hour notice and we be now expand that to all probation region restorative justice in northern ireland have be an effective method of ensure that victim and perpetrator can at least come together and perhaps try to find solution it be also way of ensure less sentence have the minister be able to look at the community restorative justice that we have do in northern ireland to ensure that those on the mainland who offend can have new life as well personally have not but gather that minister of justice official be abreast of that would like to meet the hon gentleman to hear more about that from he personally prison capacity what progress his department have make on deliver new prison place what step he be take to increase prison capacity thank to funding from the prime minister when he be chancellor we be deliver the large prison building programme since the victorian era with additional place on track to be deliver by the end of next year to secure the pipeline of further prison last october announce an investment of million to acquire land even far in advance to mitigate the risk of planning delay we be also deliver an additional rapid deployment cell across the estate the national audit office warn the government over four year ago that prison would run out of space by of the promise place it have be reveal that only just over quarter have be deliver so as result we see the government spend million rent out police cell grim condition in overcrowded prison and chaotic early release scheme why have the government prove incapable of avert this crisis as result of the record amount of investment in prison we bring on hmp fosse way and we have hmp five wells invite the hon member to visit they because these be excellent modern prison with fantastic rehabilitative condition provide an excellent opportunity to keep the public secure and prisoner rehabilitate we will also be roll out hmp millsike we have plan permission for hmp gartree we be also roll out houseblock at stocken rye hill and guys marsh and there will be further one at gartree this be government who believe in building and we be get on with the job manage prison capacity be in part about ensure that we have enough prison officer but be prison officer can be both demanding and dangerous with of prisoner between the age of and at the peak of their physical fitness my prison officer constituent tell that despite that the officer retirement age be mean that staff well into their be deal with young and often aggressive people while it be important to retain experienced prison officer and recruit to the service what consideration have my right hon and learn friend give to reduce the retirement age in line with policing prison officer be the absolute backbone of the system and it be absolutely right that we should recruit and retain be pleased to say that in we recruit an additional officer and just as importantly the resignation rate be come down from to that be really positive on my hon friend point about retirement it be worth know that the employee contribution rate to pension for prison officer be one of the most competitive in the public sector that be exactly as it should be on the specific point of retirement age will be happy to discuss that with she far non disclosure agreement whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague on the use of non disclosure agreement in sexual assault harassment and misconduct case it be important to flag at the outset that confidentiality clause be only ever use in the civil context rather than the criminal with that in mind we be table an amendment to the victims and prisoners bill to make any non disclosure agreement void if it purport to restrict the right of an individual to report the same act to the police or to access any kind of medical or therapeutic support move that have be welcome by many include the law society and the bar council thousand of people be silence due to non disclosure agreement and gag clause in case of allege sexual violence bullying and harassment the legal services board have report that signatory of nda suffer devastating impact due to fear of retribution pregnant then screwed have say that an estimate mother have be gag by an nda or confidentiality clause the bill table by my hon friend the member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran would end the misuse of nda in the workplace why be the government so hesitant about support statutory ban as someone who spend more than decade practise as an employment lawyer can tell the hon lady that there be role for the confidentiality clause in any kind of compromise agreement when both side resolve their dispute without go to court and without admission of liability or any finding of liability on either side we recognise that when they be use in their most extreme form particularly in the most high profile sexual harassment claim victim have tell we that they feel they could not go to the police or access counselling we have right that wrong however will stand up for confidentiality clause and want to correct slightly the hon lady point they be only really encounter where there be dispute concern the equality act that need to be immediately contextualise it apply only in employment education and in the provision of good and service we have take the same step in relation to student through the higher education freedom of speech act reoffende rates what step he be take to reduce reoffende reduce reoffende be core mission of these ministers and this government that be why we have prioritise accommodation for prison leaver and why we have invest heavily in employment with prison employment lead and employment hub in every resettlement prison crucially the plan be work in the two year to march the proportion of prison leaver in employment six month post release more than double clearly provide safe and secure accommodation for ex offender when they leave prison be the first and most important part of get they on the path to rebuild their life what action be my right hon and learn friend take to ensure that that happen so that people be not tempt to reoffend no one in this house have do more than my hon friend to look after the plight of people who be homeless or at risk of homelessness be proud to say that the proportion of offender in home for their first night post release be that be because we have roll out week of guarantee community accommodation go to luton and dunstable and speak to probation officer who have work there for year and he say that be the single most significant policy roll out of his entire career it be critical to ensure that prisoner and ex offender can be rehabilitate do the secretary of state agree that reoffende rate would reduce far if we have more concentrated attack on the illicit substance that continue to go into prison as well as the massive use of prescription drug which many people in prison tell be cause problem for people close to release the hon gentleman raise an excellent point and he be right the reoffende rate be worth focus on in it be around and now it be the reason for that be combination of focus on accommodation as we have just discuss and employment so that people have stake in society as well as tackle substance abuse we be look at technology with great focus to ensure that people can be treat for their substance addition on the inside by the very clinician who will treat they on the outside that continuity be vital to get they off drug and rehabilitate they support for jurors if he will make an assessment of the adequacy of support available to juror who have be adversely affect by sit on jury jury be vital part of our criminal justice system and jury service be an important civic duty we want to do everything we can to help juror feel support as they undertake that important role which be why the government have announce our intention to test counselling session for juror who suffer mental and emotional strain follow trial that pilot will commence in court this summer currently juror deal with extremely violent crime witness ever increasingly sophisticated and graphic material often feel that they do not have sufficient aftercare to deal with their experience they be advise to seek counselling only with their gp or the samaritans what discussion have the minister have on increase the amount of post trial support for juror when they have face potentially traumatic level of stress as result of their experience thank the hon lady for her question which be extremely relevant as she can imagine there have be extensive discussion between the department and the judiciary about this the senior preside judge have approve the test site for the pilot that have just discuss support of the type that we be provide in the pilot have not be provide before so the pilot itself will inform an essential part of the judgment we make on whether and how we can carry on immigration legal aid what recent assessment his department have make of the adequacy of legal aid provision for immigration case access to legal aid matter we have take action to broaden access in immigration and asylum case by uplift fee for work do under the illegal migration act when it commence provide up to million this year for accreditation and re accreditation of senior caseworker conduct legal aid work allow detain duty advice scheme provider to give guidance remotely where appropriate and introduce payment for travel time between immigration removal centre and detain duty advice scheme surgery the bar council of england and wales have submit its grave concern to the ministry of justice review of civil legal aid cite that it be not sustainable in its current form and that it have significant concern in relation to future availability of counsel in immigration and asylum case it also note that in real term civil legal aid fee have now halve compare with what they be year ago what be the next step to ensure the future of legal aid in immigration case or be justice now for only the wealthy thank the hon gentleman for raise that important question we be broaden access to legal aid the mean test review when fully implement will put an additional million into legal aid and bring an additional million into the scope of legal aid we be roll out the housing loss prevention advice service that be another million go in there will be up to million go into legal aid we be also roll out the review of civil legal aid which will report later this year we will be issue green paper in july to look at what we need to do to have sustainable resilient and well resource system because we want high quality lawyer do civil legal aid that be vital for the kind of country we want to be court case backlogs what recent assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the case backlog in the criminal and civil court we remain committed to reduce the outstanding case load across our court in england and wales to enable the court to get through more case we have extend the use of nightingale courtroom this financial year allocate million for essential modernisation and repair work of our court building up to march next year and fund unlimited sitting day include day during the most recent financial year the high level since for anyone who have be victim of crime delay in get case into court add massively to the stress and anxiety they experience what would the secretary of state say to any member whose local magistrate court have criminal case wait to be hear at the end of december would he say that backlog of that scale be acceptable the right hon gentleman raise an important point about magistrate court it be true that case load in magistrate court which of course deal with over of crime common assault criminal damage non residential burglary and so on be significantly low than they be during the pandemic the particular pressure be in the crown court we make decision of principle during the white heat of covid not to get rid of jury trial now know that in scotland the snp government be little ambivalent about jury trial but we think they be very important part of the right of free bear britons we will hold fast to they and we will put in resource more nightingale court more judge by raise the retirement age and more legal aid we will invest in and recover the system while hold fast to our principle when be justice minister introduce virtual hearing so that case could proceed much more effectively will the lord chancellor kindly update the house on the progress of those hearing be delighted to hear from my right hon friend who be such distinguished minister in this department he do indeed introduce virtual hearing in our court and time have prove how prescient he be because that be the right thing to do welcome the recent decision by the judicial office to make remote hearing the default arrangement for bail application in wide context private member bill introduce by my hon friend the member for warrington south andy carter which be currently make its way through parliament will amend legislation so that magistrate and judge in magistrate county and family court will be able to hear case remotely when that be appropriate legal aid what progress he have make on implement the recommendation of the national audit office report on the government management of legal aid the national audit office report on the management of legal aid be valuable piece of work and we be consider its conclusion carefully the government hugely value the work of legal aid lawyer which be why we commission review of civil legal aid to identify option for the delivery of more effective efficient and sustainable system for legal aid provider green paper contain policy option be plan for july this year there be no provider of housing legal aid in the borough of bedford and the number of people live within km of provider of legal aid housing advice in england and wales have fall from to in the last decade do the secretary of state agree that whatever legal redress be provide in the renters reform and leasehold and freehold reform bills will be meaningless if there be no legal aid system to enforce those reform hope that the hon gentleman will welcome the million that be go to the housing loss prevention advisory service which be revolutionary step to ensure that those who be at risk of eviction can access the legal aid they require in order to make their case respectfully invite the hon gentleman to come and see so that can discuss this with he far and he can be voice for his constituent signpost they to the support that be available because it be important for they to be aware of the support that the government be provide domestic abuse what step he be take to prevent domestic abuse perpetrator from use the justice system to extend control over victim the government have take significant step to prevent domestic abuser from use the justice system to extend control over their victim section of the domestic abuse act prevent they from cross examine their victim and require special measure to be available in court and we have also amend prohibition order under section of the children act which can bar any individual from make further application to court without permission when abusive partner be judge to be bring victim back to court without reasonable purpose my hon friend take domestic abuse very seriously but be she aware that perpetrator all too frequently seek to use the civil court to perpetrate further abuse of their victim often with the support of legal aid and often use expert with no relevant qualification to make accusation of for instance parental alienation or child groom can she please reassure that the government be take this matter seriously to ensure that perpetrator do not continue to use our court system to retraumatise their victim my right hon friend ask an excellent question but let first remind she that this be precisely the issue at which the section prohibition order be direct moreover one of the change make under the domestic abuse act give the court themselves the power to make those order of their own volition rather than wait for an application from the victim as for the second part of my right hon friend question to the extent that we be make change to legal aid all those change be in favour of the victim we be remove illiquid and contested asset from consideration of mean all protective order can be obtain without any assessment of mean and we be undertake legal aid mean test review to make the test much more generous to victim my right hon friend final point concern the so call expert who give evidence on parental alienation the government do not recognise the concept of parental alienation and do not believe that it be syndrome capable of diagnosis we have respond to the domestic abuse commissioner on this subject in writing topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility since the last session of justice question have meet my ministerial counterpart in italy to discuss topic range from prevent illegal migration to tackle organise crime furthermore we have announce new offence in which incidentally my colleague be very interested prohibit the creation of sexually explicit deepfake announce measure to remove parental responsibility from those convict of the rape of child make progress with the litigation funding agreements enforceability bill in the house of lords to support access to justice for those such as the postmaster and introduce an amendment to the victims and prisoners bill to provide further

be to the contrary anybody who appear in court but particularly prosecutor must be mindful of their solemn and sacred duty to disclose material to the defence that might reasonably be consider capable of undermine the case for the prosecution that be literally the most important rule if they fail in this case would expect the appropriate authority to take robust and prompt action for the final question call imran hussain since last raise this question with ministers it have now be estimate that there be more than victim of the ssb law scandal as my hon friend the member for bradford south judith cummins say we be host an event later today to listen to those victim talk about the real impact on their life extend an invitation to the minister will he commit to my ask of real compensation and protection for the victim of what be now national scandal thank the hon gentleman for that kind invitation will consider it and respond in due course illegal migration act northern ireland urgent question to ask the secretary of state for home department if he will make statement on the high court judgment in belfast of may disapplye the illegal migration act in northern ireland let start by express the government disappointment at this judgment we continue to believe that our policy be lawful that our approach be compatible with international law and specifically that the illegal migration act proposal be compatible with article of the windsor framework the government will take step to defend their position include through an appeal we have consistently make it clear that the right commitment in the belfast good friday agreement should be interpret as they be always intend and not expand to cover issue such as illegal migration this judgment change nothing about our operational plan to send illegal migrant to rwanda this july or the lawfulness of our safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act we continue to work to get regular flight off to rwanda in the come week and nothing will distract we from that or from deliver to the timetable have set out we must start the flight to stop the boat the government have consistently apply immigration law on uk wide basis it be important to remember that those who have be serve notice for removal to rwanda be be consider under the nationality and borders act and the safety of rwanda act this judgment relate to the illegal migration act and so do not impact our operation or planning for rwanda preparation to begin flight within week be continue at pace as the prime minister make clear nothing will distract we from the job of implement the rwanda policy we must start the flight to stop the boat that be the fair thing to do it be the right thing to do for our country and it be the humane thing to do our conviction that the rwanda scheme be lawful and necessary be unchanged we be act in the national interest and we will not be deter be grateful for that response and thank the minister of state in the northern ireland office and the secretary of state for northern ireland for be present today but we need not be here as the issue elucidate yesterday by the high court in belfast be fairly and thoroughly explore in this house and in the other place during the passage of both the illegal migration act and the safety of rwanda act when my colleague and raise these concern here in parliament we be tell by the government that we be wrong yet the high court in belfast say yesterday that we be right the only difference between the encroachment on the application of our sovereign immigration policy in northern ireland as of the rest of the united kingdom by the illegal migration act be that case be advanced on the basis of that act yet case on the safety of rwanda act have not yet be consider however the government will know that the rationale outline yesterday by the high court for the illegal migration act will similarly apply to the safety of rwanda act as well it need not be so although the government choose to dismiss the concern we outline in this house and that our colleague outline in the other place they have an opportunity to put this issue beyond doubt table an amendment to new clause along with my colleague give the government the opportunity to put the issue to bed in order to maintain the integrity of this country sovereign immigration policy and the integrity and protection of our border but they choose not to do so be grateful that the minister have indicate his willingness to appeal but when they have the opportunity to put the issue beyond doubt why do they not do that do they recognise that in not do so they have significantly impair the uniformity of the uk immigration policy in long before the eu be envisage and long before the uk join and then depart the island of great britain and ireland have an integrity in immigration policy the common travel area apply what step be the government take to get british isles solution to immigration outside the control of the eu and outside as it be the schengen area finally what step will the minister and his government take to assert parliament sovereign will to protect the border of the united kingdom be very grateful to the right hon gentleman for his constructive tone as he eloquently make his case note the narrative that he have advance the government be consider judgment very carefully as you would expect mr speaker and we be take legal advice can reconfirm as the prime minister say yesterday that the government intend to appeal the judgment we have consistently make it clear that the right commitment in the belfast good friday agreement should be interpret as they be always intend and not expand to cover reserved issue such as illegal migration we be equally clear that immigration be reserved matter that have always be apply uniformly across the uk we do not accept that the good friday agreement should be read so creatively as to extend to matter such as tackle illegal migration which be uk wide issue and not in any way relate to the original intention of the good friday agreement on the specific point about the common travel area all immigration legislation provide uk wide framework for legal and illegal migration we continue to have constructive work relationship with the irish government when it come to ensure that abuse of the common travel area be robustly and appropriately tackle on the specific point about assert parliament sovereign will around these matter would argue that the recent safety of rwanda act clearly assert parliament sovereign will while the late judgment relate to the ima we be committed to appeal it call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee this case together with the case few month ago about the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act have common theme the applicability of article of the windsor framework and the direct application of eu law what be the government go to do about that will they seek to expedite the appeal directly to the supreme court it seem to this be fundamental issue that need resolve far will they seek further clarification either from the joint committee on the northern ireland protocol or by other mean to clarify the situation and protect non devolve matter from be deal with in this way be always grateful to my right hon and learn friend for his contribution he speak with real authority give his professional background his role in this house and his former position as distinguished secretary of state and lord chancellor he will recognise that the court will make its final order in two week when an appeal can be bring he make number of observation on which ministers will reflect when take decision but as have say and as the prime minister have make very clear it be our intention to appeal this judgment we think that it be right and proper to take all step necessary to defend our position call the shadow minister the conservative chaos continue it truly beggar belief that just week after the prime minister negotiate the windsor framework in february last year he promptly bring forward immigration legislation that appear to have leave northern ireland with immigration rule that be different from those for the rest of the uk concern about the illegal migration act be raise at the time by the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson as he have just point out why do the government choose to ignore his warning do not believe that the minister answer the question that the right hon gentleman just put to he we on the labour benches be utterly commit to uphold both the good friday agreement and the windsor framework in all their dimension but this government appear to be more committed to their fail illegal migration act can the minister assure the house that nothing that the government do will in any way compromise the good friday agreement or the windsor framework for those who be understandably struggle to keep up with the never end stream of immigration legislation that have be flow from this government the illegal migration act be the second of three bills all of which have one goal in mind send asylum seeker to rwanda and all of which be completely fail on their own term it have be shamble from start to finish meanwhile we on the labour benches be clear about the problem that we face large number of desperate asylum seeker be cross continent exploit by criminal smuggling gang who operate route across the english channel and be be meet by an incompetent and clueless conservative government who have lose control of our border and be addict to headline chase gimmick in contrast the labour party would never have go down the rwanda rabbit hole instead of waste taxpayer money on rwanda we would introduce new border security command with extra resource and new power to go after the criminal gang instead of use expensive asylum hotel we will deliver our backlog clearance plan and will have new return unit to remove people with no right to be in the uk once again urge the minister to stop flog this dead horse of rwanda policy and to instead adopt labour pragmatic plan to stop the tories small boat chaos and fix our broken asylum system different week same rant week on week we hear the same rant about the opposition position but they have no credible plan to stop the flow of people cross the channel simply do not accept the shadow minister characterisation of the situation let be clear for he yes we will uphold our legal obligation we be committed to that but the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act do not engage the good friday agreement include the right chapter those right seek to address long stand specific issue relate to northern ireland past and do not extend to matter engage by the act should also reiterate for he because perhaps he miss this that we be operationalise the rwanda policy on the basis of the nationality and borders act as for the opposition front benchers very scant alternative for tackle illegal migration which the shadow minister today again proffer to the house can tell he that we have already double national crime agency funding for immigration and crime we already have thousand of official work on this matter in the migration and border directorate in practice his policy mean migrant amnesty and let thousand of illegal migrant who should not be here stay in the uk indefinitely he would end the rwanda scheme the leader of the opposition have be very clear that he would end that come what may but it be already work and deter people from make crossing the opposition would allow ten of thousand of claim to be lodge from outside the united kingdom undo all the progress we have make in address the asylum backlog they would also do deal with the european union one that will not stop the boat take asylum seeker every year from eu country do not think that be credible offering to the country the opposition just do not get it they be try to take the public for fool fortunately we have plan and we be get on and deliver on it we be deliver resource and we will see our plan through will my hon friend indicate the extent to which the illegal migration act the windsor framework and the european union withdrawal agreement act as it relate to the sovereignty of the whole united kingdom include northern ireland could have be word sufficiently clearly and unambiguously to remove the ground for this judgment in line with the disapplication principle set out in paragraph of the supreme court judgment on rwanda from last november which be extremely clear be grateful to my hon friend for his contribution refer he and all right hon and hon member to the position that have set out the government be clear that the will of parliament have be express on these issue the position be as have set out and we will robustly defend it we come to the snp spokesperson the snp welcome the judgment from the high court of belfast and thank the northern ireland human rights commission and the individual in the other case for take this matter forward it be important that these awful piece of legislation be challenge note to the minister that this judgment come from domestic court not the international court that the government seem so terribly afraid of and consistently run down the court find that the illegal migration act be incompatible with article of the windsor framework and with the european convention on human right section and of the act lead to diminution of right the court also find incompatibility between the act and the human rights act on the duty to remove obligation to potential victim of modern slavery and human trafficking and responsibility to child and their good interest all extremely serious matter that remain of concern as the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson say all this be entirely predictable the government be warn about the implication for the good friday agreement throughout proceeding on the illegal migration act and the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act can the minister say why his government fail to heed the warning and expert advice why do they ignore the status of northern ireland and what now for the applicability of the rwanda act in northern ireland my fellow scottish mp and be disturb by the fact that our constituent neighbour and friend be not even afford the same right as those in northern ireland what be the implication of that decision for the union human right should be for all of we can probably answer that question fairly rapidly we fully understand the position of the scottish national party which have be consistently express during the passage of the various piece of legislation the snp do not support the government in our effort to tackle illegal migration head on the position be as have describe will not give running commentary on ongoing litigation but we be determined to appeal this judgment we be take legal advice and as have say can be very clear that the judgment change nothing about our operational plan to send illegal migrant to rwanda this july or the lawfulness of our safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act concern have be express about migrant flock to northern ireland to avoid deportation to rwanda but there be absolutely no benefit whatsoever to do so we be operationalise this policy on the basis of the nationality and borders act thank my hon friend for come to the chamber hope he be enjoy life back at the home office in the decision the judge find that section of the european union withdrawal act as amend by the windsor framework must be read as mean that northern ireland be effectively to be treat as part of the european union believe the assurance give to at the time but be it not patently clear now that the windsor framework have operate in way that undermine our sovereignty and northern ireland place in the united kingdom and have fundamentally fail on its first contact with reality refer my right hon and learn friend to what have say about our determination to appeal the judgment as she know from real experience immigration be reserved matter and policy should be apply consistently across the uk as we have do consistently to date the european convention on human right be not just key part of the uk unwritten constitution but fundamental to the good friday agreement that be where the commitment to the vindication of right flow from yes brexit and the provision that have follow have underpin those right and have allow for the pursuance of remedy perhaps those who champion the brexit project might step through the consequence of their action well in future be glad that our region have additional protection but the ruling be very clear the illegal migration act be not compatible with human right and the declaration of incompatibility have implication in all jurisdiction be it not time that the government develop an actual strategy that focus on safe route target people smuggle gang and invest in efficient processing be it not time we have an actual plan instead of this million performance of cruelty profoundly disagree with the hon lady stance on brexit and respectfully disagree with her interpretation and characterisation of the situation that we be discuss we have see over half million people come to this country via safe and legal route since we can all be enormously proud of that as country but there be moral imperative to shut down the evil criminal gang that be responsible for take people money and bring they across the channel in unseaworthy vessel with no regard whatsoever for human life for whether those people arrive safely we will do everything necessary within our power to put those evil criminal gang out of business to date we have make progress through the plan that have be deliver but this be the important next step in render the business model redundant urge the hon lady to rethink her position it be not good enough to say it all too difficult and just allow unlimited number of people to make those very dangerous crossing without have an alternative country to relocate people to when there be no prospect of remove they to their country of origin we vote in referendum to end the rule of eu law throughout the united kingdom include northern ireland give the muddle that the court be create be not the only way out of this an urgent short piece of legislation that assert beyond doubt that we control our own border the government believe that we have legal basis for this recognise my right hon friend determination for we to get on and deliver on the rwanda policy that be precisely what we be do on the basis of the nationality and borders act at this stage but when it come to the ima we believe that we have strong legal basis and that be why we be appeal the judgment across the united kingdom include northern ireland there be of our fellow human being who have arrive in the uk since march last year and be in limbo their claim be not even be triaged while they await third country to take they the government know that most of these folk will turn out to be genuine refugee if their case be ever assess they be nevertheless sit rot at the taxpayer expense vulnerable to exploitation and unable to move on even this government admit that the majority will never go to rwanda so what be the government plan for those soul we be clearly commit to commence the illegal migration act as soon as possible the hon gentleman will know about the work that have go on in the home office over the last year or so that have dramatically improve asylum decision make productivity all effort that would be out of the window be those on the opposition front bench to form government we will take appropriate decision on individual cohort will not get into that on the floor of the house today that your job the hon gentleman keep chuntere from sedentary position but the fact be that we take appropriate cohort relate decision the message must be very clear that people should not be come to the united kingdom via perilous journey on small boat that be not an acceptable position to be advocate we will not advocate that position and will continue to take step to address it the message should go out very clearly to anyone think of get in small boat do do it many in northern ireland will want to understand the practical implication of this court case if as some expect it mean that northern ireland have become more attractive place for someone who have arrive in britain on small boat what be the government do to investigate plan for and manage that and to ensure that it do not have cost implication for the northern ireland executive or local authority in northern ireland what can say to my right hon friend who of course take real interest in all matter northern ireland be that we be operationalise the rwanda policy on uk wide basis the legal foundation for that be the nationality and borders act as say early there be no benefit to anybody who think that go to northern ireland will lead to their not be in scope for relocation to rwanda that be not the case the position be clear and we be get on and operationalise the policy use the legal footing that be already available to we the government can make as many appeal promise from the dispatch box and agreement about safeguard the union as they want but the fact remain that because of the pathetic handover of northern ireland to the european union eu law now extend to and must be apply in northern ireland as the judge make clear yesterday the result be that we have another hole in the government immigration policy national immigration policy now dictate by the eu northern ireland will become back door in the united kingdom and that will hasten the day when we have people control as well as good control between northern ireland and gb do the minister recognise that unless we remove the source of the problem namely the commitment in the withdrawal agreement it will continue there be no merit whatsoever in the suggestion that the uk would hand northern ireland over to the european union on the matter that we be debate today the judgment change nothing about our operational plan to send illegal migrant to rwanda this july or about the lawfulness of our safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act we continue to work to get regular flight off to rwanda in the come week and nothing will distract we from that or from deliver to the timetable that set out we must start the flight to stop the boat have be consistently clear that the commitment in the belfast good friday agreement should be interpret as they be always intend and not expand to cover issue such as illegal migration we will take all step to defend that position include through appeal those be the word of the prime minister as say we be operationalise the rwanda policy on uk wide basis and we will see through the commitment that we have make on the windsor framework we tell you so on the judgment itself legally all road lead not to rome but in this case to strasbourg and the european convention on human right the convention be draft for perfectly honourable reason in the aftermath of the horror of the second world war but that be over year ago it have now clearly be overtake by event and international migration flow have not the time now come for conservative government to include in our election manifesto clear commitment to seek to negotiate that convention with our european partner and should those negotiation fail to leave it if we be not prepared to walk away they will never take we seriously refer my right hon friend to the government stance on the legal position in relation to the illegal migration act would also say that for illegal migrant all road lead to rwanda and for the people smuggler responsible for that evil criminality all road lead to prison strongly welcome the logical and inevitable judgment from the high court of northern ireland if the government want to have national immigration policy they must repeal the illegal migration act repeal the safety of rwanda act and have human right compliant policy back in the government of the uk and ireland make the solemn pledge to the people of northern ireland that the right of everyone reside in the community would be protect can the minister give cast iron assurance that under no circumstance will article of the windsor framework or the good friday agreement be unpick in the pursuit of this rabbit hole of rwanda plan refer the hon gentleman to the position that have set out in relation to the good friday agreement will not give running commentary about the litigation which be as he will appreciate ongoing absolutely and definitively disagree with he on the utility or sense in repeal the various piece of illegal migration legislation that he be so vehemently against respectfully disagree with he on that that legislation be help we to make the progress that we need to put those criminal gang out of business and ultimately save life in the channel do not think that there be anything more serious for government than that we place it front and centre in the work that we be do it be clear to that northern ireland have just as much right as anywhere else in the uk to have deterrent to illegal migration so aspect of this concern few week ago the irish government be say that they should be able to return some illegal migrant who may have go from the uk to the republic of ireland do the minister think that the irish government would be well off take that up with france if the french take the return of illegal migrant who have enter our country we would probably not have this problem in the first place as say from the dispatch box last week the position be very clear we be not willing to have that relationship with the irish government and take the return of illegal migrant that would need to be progress at an eu level we think that the european union should take back those illegal migrant think that go to the heart of the point that my hon friend have make thus far the minister have not take the opportunity to respond to the query from my right hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson about why the government decline the offer make from the dup benches which would have avoid the judgment that we have hear about will he do so now he have indicate that the government plan to appeal but if the appeal fail what then do not think it wise to speculate on hypothetical situation we be determined that there be strong legislative basis and we will defend it through the appeal as for debate that have be and go the hon gentleman will recognise that be not the minister at that time but it be fair to say that the record will speak for itself on the debate that be have we need only look at the situation in dublin to see what happen when illegal migration become an issue and be not handle correctly and to understand the strength of pursue our rwanda policy although that policy be be dismiss by some it be interesting that as be sure the minister have notice other across europe be start to look to it for solution to this question the question if not rwanda where do you want to remove people to have never be answer by labour in the light of the judgment can the minister reassure on couple of point first will the uk remain the uk border in term of migration policy so that there be no prospect of have any form of check on people between great britain and northern ireland which would effectively mean border within the united kingdom secondly will the operation of the rwanda plan be base on as he say the nationality and borders act and on the recently pass legislation the one stop shop and the child age assessment which be vital in get grip on this issue be the plan be take forward on that basis rather than on the basis of the illegal migration act which be the core point from this judgment my hon friend always speak with authority when it come to these issue and he have extensive experience have be minister in the home office can absolutely say that we will continue to apply migration policy on uk wide basis the uk border will remain that he be right to highlight the nationality and borders act and he should be proud of the effort that he take forward in government to help deliver it labour member consistently oppose it in answer to his question about where labour would send people which know he ask few week ago we be still none the wiser the truth be that the basis upon which we be able to advance the policy at this stage be the nationality and borders act he can be confident in that basis we be get on and deliver on it of course this judgment have uk wide relevance because of the declaration of incompatibility under the human rights act in our report on the illegal migration act and the rwanda policy the joint committee on human rights have repeatedly warn that many aspect of the government asylum policy breach the human rights act that be not just our view but the weight of the expert evidence that we hear in fact those with legal expertise who disagree with our finding be decidedly thin on the ground this judgment vindicate our position that on number of front the government asylum policy breach the human rights act particularly as regard the duty to remove as such will the minister confirm that the government will respect the rule of law and not take any step to deport anyone under the rwanda scheme until the relevant avenue of appeal in this case be exhausted and it be clarify that such removal would be lawful know that the hon and learn lady be vehemently oppose to the government position on tackle illegal migration believe that the minister for counter illegal migration my right hon and learn friend the member for mid dorset and north poole michael tomlinson will be in front of her committee tomorrow and have no doubt that she will want to ask those question of he to go back to the thrust of her question though the basis upon which we be facilitate relocation to rwanda at this stage be that of the nationality and borders act which be not relevant to the illegal migration act judgment that we be deal with today we be already aware that the northern ireland protocol or windsor framework whichever one prefer to call it have result in customs border in the irish sea if this judgment stand it now appear to be the case that it have also destroy the ability of the united kingdom government to determine who should remain within our own border do my hon friend not agree therefore that the framework have be prove to be inimical to british sovereignty and should be renegotiate or fail that as my right hon friend the member for wokingham sir john redwood have suggest should be disapplie by legislation of this parliament would not accept that characterisation as have confirm for the house number of time we be take forward the rwanda partnership on the basis of the nationality and borders act that be the legal footing on which we be advance the policy at this stage be confident in that legal foundation and we will appeal this judgment which relate very specifically to the illegal migration act what else be the government not tell we about where the eu have overreach into northern ireland and where people in northern ireland be once again in limbo between two regulatory entity will the secretary of state and the government do the right thing and stop string the people of northern ireland along by simply appeal the decision and will the secretary of state commit to legislate to get rid of the eu supremacy on human right contain in article of the windsor framework article of the windsor framework ensure that there be no diminution of right under the belfast good friday agreement we have be consistently clear that the commitment in the good friday agreement should be implement as they be always intend not expand to cover issue such as illegal migration rightly we will take all step to defend that position include through our appeal think we all sympathise with the minister for have to take line that be manifestly absurd why be it that the government be not go to directly legislate to deal with this situation the legislation be defective and if we go to appeal and that appeal be reject we will have lose lot more time why do we not act now to legislate and sort out this mess as think my hon friend will appreciate we be currently take legal advice in relation to this judgment it would not be right to give running commentary on the substance of that legal advice and as he know as minister be not in position to disclose that advice in any event we will robustly defend our position but the outcome that my hon friend wish to see the operationalisation of the rwanda policy to facilitate these relocation have its legislative basis in the nationality and borders act the good news be that he be one of the colleague who be in the division lobby support that act something that think his constituent would welcome the government be repeatedly warn about the pitfall of the windsor framework and have be repeatedly warn and advise about the deficiency of the rwanda legislation what be the minister go to do to ensure that as result of the government sloppy and defective drafting of legislation the lawyer be not the only winner as always we be not go to be thwart in our effort to ensure that people be relocate to rwanda with the ultimate aim of put out of business the evil criminal gang responsible for that heinous trade that put life at risk and exploit people for their money there be legal basis upon which we be take the policy forward immediately and people be be detain for the purpose of relocation caseworker be work on individual case and arrangement be in place to facilitate the flight that be where our focus and energy be at this present time but we be also appeal on the issue of the illegal migration act my hon friend the minister have already confirm that the government will appeal against the belfast high court judgment and that our commitment to the belfast agreement be unwavering so the substantive issue be the plan to process asylum seeker application in rwanda which opposition front benchers continue to say should not could not and will not work will my hon friend confirm that not only be they wrong on all three of those point but event in ireland have show how effective deterrent this policy be go to prove italy france denmark and think the political party of the eu president have already say that it set very interesting precedent one that they will be look to pursue themselves opposition front bencher be invariably wrong when it come to these issue my hon friend be right to touch on the fact that although back in we be at the forefront in announce the rwanda partnership other be now follow we as government we recognise and have consistently say that this be novel approach to tackle the issue but such challenge require novel solution and it be right that we look at novel way of tackle these migratory flow that be organise and facilitate by evil criminality the home secretary be lead that effort internationally as well my hon friend point be become ever more relevant in fact only this morning see additional report of other country explore these sort of arrangement belfast city council have the second high number of asylum seeker in all of the united kingdom that indicate how important this issue be for we in northern ireland can the minister confirm that there be still freedom of movement within the united kingdom and that subsequently under the policy of dispersal we will be able to move any asylum seeker to the gb mainland to be direct determine and deal with as this government see fit can he also confirm that this court judgment will not preclude northern ireland from hold its constitutional and legal position within the united kingdom until consent give through border poll determine otherwise which be the very foundation of the good friday agreement there be various technical aspect bind up in that question if may will take that series of point away and provide the hon gentleman with write response but what can say in top line term be that when it come to the application of the rwanda policy we be deliver it on uk wide basis have sit and listen to all the question from across the house so as be ask the last one can say to the minister that my constituent and be very worried about immigration and that if the rwanda policy that this house have decide to go ahead with work that should happen and it should be deterrent however what be obvious across the house today be that there be concern about the union this country be about union of country together so ask the minister to make sure that all government departments understand the concern of colleague from northern ireland and from across the house to protect the union at all cost this government will always always uphold the union both in letter and in spirit my right hon friend be right to highlight the importance of this issue to his constituent in hemel hempstead and the importance of tackle illegal migration head on he can be absolutely assure that home office ministers take our responsibility to the union incredibly seriously the fact that be join on the front bench by northern ireland office colleague for this urgent question be very welcome it provide an opportunity to really demonstrate the fact that we do work as one government on this issue it be incumbent on all minister to uphold the union and its importance to our great country in every sense thank the minister for answer the urgent question international health regulations urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if she will make statement on the ongoing negotiation on the world health organisation pandemic agreement and amendment to the international health regulation ahead of any vote at the world health assembly that start next week congratulate my hon friend on secure this urgent question and be grateful for the opportunity to update the house want to start by make three promise first the government will only accept the accord and target amendment to the international health regulation if they be firmly in the united kingdom national interest and no text have yet be agree we will only accept the accord and amendment by the world health assembly and adopt they if it be firmly in the uk national interest to do so secondly this government will only sign up to measure that respect our national sovereignty thirdly under no circumstance will we allow the who to have the power to mandate lockdown that would be unthinkable and have never be propose protect our sovereignty be british red line let now dispel three myth about the negotiation first there be the myth that the negotiation be be lead by the who they be not be lead by the who they be entirely lead by member state secondly there be the idea that we would give away fifth of our vaccine in the next pandemic that be simply not true of course we be generous country and company may make their own choice to donate vaccine but that would be and should be entirely their decision country be discuss voluntary mechanism to which uk business could sign up if they wish to share vaccine in return for information they may need to develop their product the third point be about transparency this be point take extremely seriously as one who campaign so hard for this parliament sovereignty it be not common practice for the government to give an update on live negotiation but meet some interested parliamentarian last week to discuss their concern also have the pleasure of lead westminster hall debate in december on these negotiation which be attend by my hon friend and many other and will continue to meet he and other concerned parliamentarian as we act in the national interest effective agreement can help we to deliver smart surveillance swifter pathogen and data sharing and fast development of pandemic vaccine test and treatment that would save life and protect people both in the uk and around the world can say how much appreciate the commitment that the minister have just make want to acknowledge the good work that he and indeed his predecessor have be do in government ahead of the world health assembly that meet next week be very pleased to hear the commitment he have just make my concern be not with the government position but with the who itself appreciate the minister point that member state be lead on these proposal which be worry in itself but we know what the real agenda of the who be from the draft that have be submit in recent month it want to have bind power over national government to introduce all sort of restrictive measure on our citizen it want to be able to direct the health budget of member state and it want to introduce global digital health passport and other measure the who be an organisation that aspire in word that be still in the draft treaty to be the directing and coordinate authority on international health work include on pandemic prevention preparedness and response appreciate that no text have yet be agree which be why it be important that we have debate but the proposal in the late draft publish last month be concern enough they require national government to agree to whole series of commitment which will be bind under international law if the uk sign up to they these cover surveillance of the health of the population commitment on fund both in the uk and abroad emergency authorisation of new vaccine or speed up authorisation process give some vaccine to the who to distribute potentially authorise national government to introduce the compulsory vaccination of traveller and give very wide discretion to the director general of the who to act on his own initiative the government still have the opportunity to oppose the treaty and the regulation as they be currently draft and appreciate that we be wait to see the final text in the come day but can ask the minister to clarify very explicitly from the dispatch box what the government red line be hear what he say but could he go little far on the detail of what he mean will the government oppose any text that bind this or future government in how they respond to health threat finally and crucially will the government comply with the crag constitutional reform and governance act requirement to put the treaty to ratification vote in parliament thank my hon friend for the constructive way in which he and other parliamentarian have engage with this subject matter and the challenge it present as say in my opening remark no text have yet be agree set out some of our negotiate red line and be happy to confirm from the dispatch box that the current text be not acceptable to we therefore unless the current text be change and refine we will not be sign up to it my hon friend ask how the treaty will be ratify if we reach position to which the uk government could agree the uk treaty make process mean that the accord be of course negotiate and agree by the government as he will know parliament play an important part in scrutinise treaty under the crag process and determine how international obligation should be reflect domestically however it be important to remember that because the exact form of the accord have not yet be agree the parliamentary adoption process will depend on under which article of the who constitution the accord be adopt call the shadow minister this country have role and responsibility in protect global health it be part we play during the covid pandemic british science stand tall on the world stage and our country donate million vaccine dos to help vaccinate the world we learn from the omicron variant that when it come to global pandemic none of we be safe until all of we be safe we also benefit from researcher around the world share early knowledge about collaboration that be crucial in protect british people and ultimately in develop the vaccine however there be clear principle when it come to national security it be the same one we follow when we get on to an aeroplane we apply our own oxygen mask before we help other apply theirs the minister say the draft text be not acceptable and want to be clear that labour government will not sign anything that would leave our population unprotecte in the face of novel disease we be debate treaty that be still be negotiate by member state and none of we know the final content or wording so can the minister reconfirm for the house that the government will not sign up to anything that would compromise the uk ability to take domestic decision on national public health measure have he consult the uk life science sector ahead of these negotiation and what conversation have he have with international counterpart and our ally about this treaty and our joint pandemic preparedness as we work with colleague around the world to bolster our effort to tackle novel threat it be vital that we get the balance right between share knowledge and protect intellectual property so can he set out his approach to any requirement for time limit waiver of intellectual property relate to vaccine and therapeutic in the event of global disease outbreak finally it be vital that we be lead by science and evidence when tackle the threat of global disease epidemic so can the minister tell we what his department be do to tackle misinformation about pandemic and vaccine thank the shadow minister for his remark confirm that we be firmly fight in britain interest for an accord and strengthen international health regulation that fully respect national sovereignty but can save life and protect people both in the uk and around the world they have to fully respect national sovereignty and that be at the heart of our negotiating position it will therefore always be up to nation state to decide what be implement within their own border just to answer couple of the hon gentleman specific point yes have meet representative of the life science sector to discuss this and some of the specific proposal the last meeting we have be last week with regard to deal with international counterpart will be attend the world health assembly in geneva myself my final point be that the hon gentleman be right to pay tribute to what this country do globally during the pandemic of course in we use the presidency to mobilise country to donate surplus vaccine and by may the have donate billion dos against the target of million the uk alone donate over million dos benefit country we all want well co ordination in the face of any future pandemic risk but it be also clear that the who want supranational power will my right hon friend guarantee that the uk government will not accept any obligation that require the uk to legislate to implement any element of the who treaty into uk law at the moment we do not envisage any proposal that would require change to domestic law and it be highly unlikely that any proposal will come forward in that shape or form have some sympathy with what my right hon friend say most organisation such as the who will always look to expand their remit and look to gain more power in order to co ordinate thing but these negotiation be be lead by member state and sovereignty be key part of the negotiating position of the vast majority of the country involve it be not just the uk argue for this country around the world be argue that this need to be high level agreement that help co ordination and information sharing but in no way tie country hand in how we respond domestically to any future pandemic we can not have repeat of what the who call the catastrophic failure of the international community to ensure that be fight everywhere with all of our ability it will require give and take with give on the part of oecd country commensurate with our comparative economic strength and population health although there may be disagreement across the house think we all agree that pandemic should be fight on an international basis and that other country should be assist where we have the strength and ability to do that despite that level of agreement there have be persistent barrage of misinformation and disinformation not least hit our own inboxe as negotiation on this proceed what step will the uk government be take to ensure that the public understand what the treaty will do and to tackle and robustly rebut the misinformation and disinformation that be be spread particularly about this treaty the scottish national party spokeswoman make very important point there have be lot of misinformation and disinformation but that be in part the result of the transparency on all the amendment be publish on the who website for example as well as various other information which have allow people to think that that be suddenly the kind of text that would be agree we need to be clear that no text whatsoever have be agree the negotiation continue think most people in this house and hopefully outside would recognise that the work draft text most recently publish on the who website be significant improvement on the initial draft think we all share an ambition that we will get to text that can be agree but it have to put national interest and national sovereignty at its heart will therefore do my good to ensure that the house be keep update as further iteration of the text emerge the late version be publish on the who website on april as the health minister who represent the uk at last year world health assembly and the united nations general assembly stand at that dispatch box and confirm that we would not sign up to any ihr amendment or any other instrument that would compromise the uk ability to make domestic decision on national measure concern public health can my right hon friend confirm that his majesty government position on this remain unchanged and resolute pay tribute to my predecessor for the work he do let reiterate that the uk government have make it clear that we will not sign up to any accord or any change in the international health regulation that would cede sovereignty to the who in make domestic decision on national measure concern public health such as domestic immunisation programme or lockdown can the minister confirm that the who be slow to react to sars severe acute respiratory syndrome be slow to react to the ebola crisis be slow to react to and steadfastly refuse to criticise in any way the chinese regime throughout that period that be the case will he confirm again from the dispatch box that no outside organisation will ever be able to take any decision to do with the internal health and wellbeing of citizen of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland one of the reason why the who have in the past be slow to respond and why it might be slow in future be that it be member state lead organisation govern by the world health assembly which comprise member state operate under the who constitution any decision make by the who have to be agree by all member state include the uk beforehand and that do somewhat tie its hand however we and many like minded country believe that all these decision be well make domestically depend on the domestic situation the domestic situation in the uk will be radically different in any future pandemic from the domestic situation in other country around the world we have to work collaboratively on thing like the sharing of datum but there be many other area where it be right that decision be make in this country by our government welcome confirmation from my right hon friend that the government do not consider the current drafting of the propose treaty to be acceptable it be good to have that on the record on principle lead basis do not believe it be in the uk national interest to accede to this anything that compromise our ability to make sovereign choice be profoundly unwelcome can the minister give commitment that regardless of the technicality of the precise form that any treaty may finally emerge in if the uk do decide to accede to this treaty we will have vote in this house we can see certainly on this side of the house there be no presence on the labour benches that there be real reservation about what this will mean in practice for our ability to make the right choice for our people appreciate the point that my right hon friend make as say in answer to an early question because we do not know the exact form that the accord will take at the moment it be very hard to say what the parliamentary procedure that flow out of it will be but certainly will provide any opportunity can to facilitate as much debate as possible he and agree on many thing but here would just say that have look at the detail genuinely believe that agree meaningful accord be firmly in the uk national interest this accord be an opportunity to enhance uk health economic and national security an effective accord will improve disease surveillance and prevention by make sure that globally we have the information we need to raise the alarm early it strengthen research and development to help stop pandemic in their track and enable well co ordinate global response to pandemic include get vaccine treatment and test rapidly to where they be need most genuinely believe that there be window of opportunity here to get an accord that be in the uk national interest we be not there yet the current text be unacceptable but we will keep negotiate because believe there be window of opportunity here to agree something that be genuinely in the uk national interest but if we can not agree that we will not sign it public health be devolve in the context of wales scotland and northern ireland therefore how often do the minister engage with the devolved government on the uk government negotiate position in relation to these matter as the hon gentleman will know international treaty be matter for the uk government and therefore this be be negotiate by the uk government be appoint as minister in the department of health back in november but be happy to reassure he that do not see myself as purely the minister for health in england visit wales very early on to meet some of the outstanding life science company there which be develop product that will benefit patient across the entire uk visit northern ireland to see some of the great university and outstanding business there and also visit scotland to meet michael matheson the then scottish health secretary and also the university of edinburgh and various other outstanding university and business so very much see the union and the impact that everything have on the whole united kingdom as be central to these negotiation may congratulate my hon friend the member for devizes danny kruger on secure this urgent question also congratulate those on the government benches note that there be no one on the opposition benches apart from the shadow minister for address the question of whether any meaningful accord be possible supranationality have to be out as have say on countless occasion when it be not in our national interest sovereignty have to prevail remind the minister of the regulation bring in by the eu at the time of covid which have to be abandon because we put our foot down and say that we would not accept its restriction on our ability to produce the vaccine that be good example will he please follow it and make sure we do not have any weasel word thank my hon friend for his passionate and pertinent point throughout the negotiation the uk have make it clear and we will continue to do so that we will not sign up to any accord that fail to meet our global health and uk health security priority likewise the uk would not sign up to an accord that cede sovereignty to the who over domestic decision on national measure concern public health such as immunisation programme or lockdown any necessary or appropriate change to domestic legislation or new domestic legislation would be make through the usual parliamentary process however because we do not yet know the exact detail of the accord can not be any clear on how exactly parliament will get to scrutinise the accord if we get to an agreement the treaty be not just about datum sharing and information gathering it be also about set up system of pandemic management under the leadership of the who it have poor history of management and decision making can the minister give we an assurance that he will not accept any surrendering of uk power to an international body that can interfere with decision that will affect the life of ordinary people here in the united kingdom listen to his response about devolved government and it seem there have not be much discussion with the devolved administration he will not even guarantee vote in this house on such an important issue can he guarantee that we will not undemocratically hand over democratic control to non democratic body we will not be hand over any kind of control over what we do domestically national sovereignty be clear red line as make clear in my opening remark it be important to recognise that there be challenge with these thing which be be negotiate within the exist international health regulation the director general of the world health organisation already have the ability to declare public health event of international concern and issue temporary recommendation that provide non bind guidance to member state we believe that we need to stay in situation where the world health organisation have an important convening role internationally to discuss issue but the domestic response to any future pandemic be for domestic government to make anything that impinge on uk national sovereignty will therefore be unacceptable to we want to put on the record my thank to the minister for his hard work and for take the time last week to meet and colleague to discuss the term of this treaty he will know that be profoundly sceptical about the world health organisation ability to manage global pandemic in the light of serious error of judgment poor leadership and be afraid well chronicle conflict of interest that have subsequently emerge of course we can help poor country and collaborate with other nation but under no circumstance must we surrender our sovereignty or sign up to lockdown charter hear what he say about how the text currently on the table do not bind our hand but he will know as many of we do that in the heat of an emergency during real pandemic irresistible pressure will mount on government to make decision that may well turn out to be wholly harmful as we find and the wrong decision for the good of the country will he agree that fundamentally to coin phrase no pandemic treaty be well than bad pandemic treaty agree with my right hon and learn friend that no treaty be well than bad treaty however if we scroll back to why this process be originally start it be the former member for uxbridge and south ruislip who lead the international call for this accord the reason behind it be that we believe that commitment on strong international collaboration and co operation on global health be crucial to secure the uk health and economic security however domestic decision still have to be leave to sovereign nation state to take the right decision for their country think there be lot of agreement between my right hon and learn friend and and thank she once again for engage in such constructive fashion and for meet to express she and other parliamentarian view concur that any new treaty have to be right for the uk will the minister reflect on the meaning of the word pandemic which suggest an element of international spread of disease or global problem for the sake of balance in this urgent question will he emphasise the importance of the uk work collaboratively on an intergovernmental basis with other in how they react to pandemic with restriction on travel and global vaccine equity as long as the world be safe the uk be also safe the hon gentleman make an important point talk about the leadership show by the uk government when we have the presidency back in in addition to the uk supply vaccine around the world as of an estimate million death have be prevent due to the covax support vaccination programme in different country around the world we need to work internationally share datum can head off future pandemic and good accord would deliver the datum sharing and collaboration that can prevent future health emergency rather than tie the hand of domestic government in respond appropriately to such emergency may say on behalf of the volunteer and other in the vaccination centre around the country during the pandemic which have the honour of work in that the key be that vaccine be available to we before we give they to anyone else in the world be listen to what the minister be say but do he agree that collaboration do not mean compulsion in any way or form as volunteer vaccinator during the pandemic agree with my right hon friend we have to look after our own people our own citizen the people we be elect to represent first we be invest heavily in the british life science sector to ensure that it be even more prepared for any future pandemic we be ensure that we have more domestic manufacturing capability so that we can have more vaccine ourselves without be reliant on other country however at the point where new pandemic be emerge in part of world far from our shore we still need to ensure that the datum particularly the pathogen datum be share early so that world beat british company whether the tiny life science start up or the big pharmaceutical company can use it to produce the drug that will hopefully ensure that it do not become full blow pandemic and do not cost as many life as the last one start by congratulate the hon member for devizes danny kruger on his timing of this important urgent question repeatedly during this session the minister have state that we do not really know what shape the pandemic agreement accord or treaty will take under paragraph of article of the international health regulation all member state must have full draft of the amendment to treaty to be vote on four month in advance despite the fact that the who be break its own rule it be insist on move forward with the vote in geneva on may on the pandemic treaty and the amendment to the international health regulation will the minister join and many other in call for deferment of those vote until this house and other around the world have have chance to examine these important detail no because there be no text that have be agree this have be evolve we have see new amendment and new revised draft the late negotiation on the accord take place on april to may and the next round of negotiation will take place on and may and continue on to may lead up to the world health assembly meeting take place in geneva on may to june there have be lot of progress in get text that be more agreeable to majority of member state but we be still some way off get to text that can be agree we be hop for significant change in the come day and will do my good to keep the house update may firmly tell the minister that the road to hell be pave with good intention do not trust bureaucracy and certainly do not trust this one judge by the way in which it behave last time with its instinct to lock we all down we have see huge damage from that to every part of our national infrastructure suspect that the tendency will be to do the same again to our detriment will the minister reassure he have do so already but want to hear it again that he will in effect not sign anything we do not need to sign something to collaborate with other nation for their good as well as for the good of our own country happily reassure my hon friend that national sovereignty come first we will continue to do everything that we can to ensure that we get an accord that be agreeable but if the accord would undermine our sovereignty and our ability to act domestically in any way we will simply not sign it have be contact by large number of constituent who have voice grave concern about the power and right request and require by this unelected body while we may support some of the work carry out to help develop country will not sign away the sovereignty of this nation our participation in the who should not come with prerequisite of sign up to these demand far if that be the case we should no long be participate member of the who just to reiterate my point the government will only accept the accord and target amendment to the international health regulation if they be firmly in the united kingdom national interest and no text have yet be agree we continue the negotiation and will do my good to keep right hon and hon member as inform as can without provide run commentary on the negotiation but genuinely believe that we can get to position where there be an accord that be in the uk national interest will the minister then publish the amendment that the government be seek he say rightly that he need very different treaty from the one that we see on offer he need to persuade other nation so he should be make public case we would then not be so suspicious there must be no new legal requirement impose on the united kingdom we do not envisage any new legal requirement be impose on the united kingdom and any change to our domestic ability to react to any future pandemic would be unacceptable and cross one of our red line in this urgent question and in the westminster hall debate which know my right hon friend also participate in be as clear as could be on the uk red line in these negotiation we have be up front with both parliament and our international partner in say that the current text be not agreeable to we and we be seek significant change if we be to reach an accord that will be sign by the united kingdom too participate in that westminster hall debate for the record this urgent question have be run for well over half an hour during which not single labour back bencher have be present in the chamber let alone ask question even though we be discuss in effect the medical sovereignty of the united kingdom as there be lot of conservative in the chamber may say to the minister that we would probably be well not sign this treaty at all that be not least because many of we have concern about malign influence on the who if we be to sign it although would rather that we do not will the minister give we cast iron commitment that we will have vote dare say meaningful vote on it in this house before it come into force thank my right hon friend for his powerful point which think once again underline that you can only trust the conservatives with the nhs as have say in answer to couple of question unfortunately because we do not know the form that the treaty will take it be hard to set out the parliamentary process for its adoption there be different parliamentary process depend on the form that it take make the personal commitment to he that will do everything that can to engage the house but at this point can not specify the procedure and process that would be follow in the house or whether there would be vote thank my hon friend the member for devizes danny kruger for secure the urgent question and mr speaker for grant it the world health organisation be fail mega expensive unelected unaccountable supranational body which be increasingly under the influence of the global elite fund by small number of non state actor and china be malign influence over it surely the initial draft of this treaty must have set alarm bell ring even in whitehall at this attempt power grab may urge the minister not to sign the treaty we can have enhance co operation and collaboration to counter future pandemic without legally bind commitment would argue that who membership give the uk seat at the table in global health discussion allow we to amplify uk priority at an international level there be member state if we can agree high level treaty that do not impinge on our national sovereignty via the negotiation between the member state think that will be good outcome and well outcome than try to negotiate individual agreement with all member state say to my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois that it be hardly surprising that debate that largely hinge on national sovereignty be of little interest to the labour party the principle of national democracy be incredibly important to many of my constituent and other people in this place be absolutely pro collaboration but that need to be do through the national principle and nothing must be do that undermine the national principle this debate keep on return we think that it would end with brexit but it do not it be now go on with the european convention on human right and the who will the minister confirm that yes we be pro collaboration and co operation but that when it come to national sovereignty we should always oppose supranationalism and the bad excess of globalism the uk government have be clear that we will not sign up to an accord or any international health regulation amendment that would cede sovereignty to the who in make domestic decision on national measure concern public health such as domestic immunisation programme or lockdown respect national sovereignty right be distinct principle in the current draft of the accord and respect the sovereign right of state to adopt legislate and implement legislation within their jurisdiction remain distinct principle in the draft amendment to the ihr genuinely believe that there be window of opportunity to negotiate an accord that be in the uk national interest as well as in the global interest thank the minister for answer the urgent question point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker be sure that you and member across the house will share my disappointment that the secretary of state make great announcement about the construction of six new warship at lancaster house to group of journalist rather than in this place all our constituent would have like mp to have have the opportunity to question the secretary of state about that announcement what advice do you have for madam deputy speaker to ensure proper scrutiny of this sort of decision important as it be to our national security thank the hon gentleman for his point of order and for give notice of it mr speaker and have not have any indication that ministers intend to come to the house to make statement about this matter but note that the ministerial code say when parliament be in session the most important announcement of government policy should be make in the first instance in parliament know that mr speaker be keen that that should be implement be sure that those on the treasury bench will have make note of the point raise and will report back bathing water monitoring and reporting motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about monitoring and reporting of water quality in bathing water site in coastal area and for connected purpose be proud to represent some of the fine and clean beach in the world north devon be home to the uk only world surf reserve and the only cold water surf reserve in the world must declare an interest as surf badly and be in last weekend be proud of this government work to take the monitoring of storm overflow from just in to last year however this data be abuse along our coastline and often scar people out of the water we know that something come out of pipe but we have no idea what it contain the bill seek to expedite the testing of what be in an overflow pipe and to define what be and what be not raw sewage despite ask numerous question of the department for environment food and rural affairs be still unable to explain to anyone how an overflow pipe that contain at least rainwater can still be define as raw sewage legal definition online be clear that raw sewage should consist primarily of human faece and water it be not the water where the bacteria hang out clearly the more water the more diluted my bill relate to bathing water at coastal site because clearly there be major difference in the impact of an overflow event into something as environmentally sensitive and slow move as chalk stream compare with the massive tide huge volume and fast move seawater of the atlantic ocean saltwater itself can kill some bacteria we have see surge in year round activity along our coast thank to improved wetsuit and grow number of hardy folk wild swimming however our bathing water season which determine when our coastal water be test run only from may to september mean that when water base tourism be still go strong in devon there be no testing along our coast the bathing season datum give vital historical information about water quality although warmly welcome defra announcement yesterday that it plan to consult on series of potential reform it will not resolve the misinformation and lack of immediate information after storm overflow event this winter test take place to see if the season could be extend but it be hard to replicate the environment agency testing regime with test tube at the testing site just off the beach during winter storm with foot wave throughout the winter bather have to try to work out what be go on from the average of the previous summer datum along with detail of the last storm overflow despite have no information about what come out the pipe the department for culture media and sport advise that the environment agency provide the gold standard for whether bathing water be clean enough for sporting activity despite the lack of datum for half the year one group of year round bather explain to that they peer into the water and decide if they think it be safe to go in surely we can do well than that base on the experience of the environment agency one would think it be possible to determine when it be safe to go back into the water after an overflow event the ea recommend wait one full tidal rotation before go back into the water after an overflow have run however surfers against sewage advise hour because of virus and world health organisation datum but clearly the issue be bacteria in storm overflow surfer against sewage do such great work when establish year ago to make water company clean up their act along the coast which have see an increase in the number of bathing water with an excellent rating however its current campaigning seem to be destroy the hard win reputation of those bathing water last winter devon and cornwall be under permanent sewage watch accord to surfers against sewage yet south west water help event organiser along the coast to ensure that christmas and new year swim go ahead as far as possible we would all like no overflow to run but it rain lot in the south west of england and climate change have cause big increase in the number of big storm and torrential rain with the good will in the world the water company will not stop it rain and that rain have to go somewhere sporadic testing on our beach show that often the stream run on to the beach be far more polluted than the water come out the storm overflow we need to follow the science and recognise that in constituency such as mine less than of the water pollution we deal with be relate to human sewage there be work to do but stop storm overflow be not the be all and end all to improve the quality of our bathing water even surfer against sewage recognise that there have be improvement although it do not like my share the email it send last year which state with regard to the beach in your constituency we totally agree that huge improvement have be make to water quality there and in many place around the country and the very last thing we want to do be scare people off from get in the water anyone can set up an app and advise whether the water quality be safe but no one know whether the water have be test many regular user of our bathing water recognise that when it rain even if there be no storm overflow the water be not as clean as when it have not we need accurate and up to date datum on the water quality in its entirety not just when an overflow have run there be some awful example of when the system do not work when the ashford sewage treatment work on the taw break down early this year the ea advise close four beach via the council however even though surfers against sewage be normally the first to rush to tell people that there be raw sewage on the beach when there be not it do not raise flag at all because it do not use that datum surf lesson continue because the message from council do not reach the beach and proper untreated sewage be discharge for six hour it be not class as storm overflow on bathing water beach so nobody pay any attention the bill would ensure some form of test datum from coastal bathing water all year round it would also require water company to test what be come out of their storm overflow when they run and that the term raw sewage be use only when the concentration of bacteria warrant it new definition would be determined to accurately reflect what be come out pipe and the seawater would be test after overflow event to accurately determine how long it take for the pollution in storm overflow to dissipate as this vary widely depend on tidal condition and by beach and overflow event over time good datum bank would be establish and well guidance would be issue than the current blanket guidance any organisation that fail to follow the guidance would not have access to the datum our beachgoer deserve well datum my own surf school say that if we listen to surfers against sewage we would never go surf despite be in the water every day not one of its instructor have ever be unwell we need all year round datum instant testing after incident and consistent advice in consumer friendly format north devon beach be some of the clean in the world as the one woman tourist board for north devon urge hon member to come down and to swim surf sail and enjoy the beautiful coastline as mathematician know that we need well datum reduce storm overflow be vital and this government be demand that of water company however just know that pipe have discharge when it have be rain be not good enough we must get well bathing water datum available all year round question put and agree to that caroline ansell mrs flick drummond anna firth kevin foster sir liam fox sir robert goodwill sally ann hart simon jupp cherilyn mackrory matt warman and selaine saxby present the bill selaine saxby accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday june and to be print bill term and conditions of employment beg to move that the draft trade union and labour relations consolidation act amendment of schedule order which be lay before this house on april be approve the draft order will increase the deterrent effect of the code of practice on dismissal and re engagement which will refer to as the code for the remainder of this debate the government have be clear that threat of dismissal and re engagement should not be use as negotiation tactic by employer when the pandemic lead to case of dismissal and re engagement the government ask acas to conduct an evidence gather exercise to help we well understand this issue the report be publish in june the government then ask acas to produce new guidance to ensure that employer be clear on their responsibility when consider make change to employment contract the guidance be publish in november acas have also publish guidance for employee the government then go far to address the use of dismissal and re engagement by bring forward draft code aim to ensure that the practice be only ever use as last resort and that employee be properly consult and treat fairly the code seek to ensure that where an employer want to make change to employee term and condition the employer engage in meaningful consultation with view to reach agreement with employee or their representative in good faith be grateful to the minister for give way we discuss this issue upstairs in committee can he confirm whether the motion which put the code into practice would stop willie walsh from threaten to fire and rehire air steward air stewardess and other at british airways or the worker at british gas yes or no it be wrong to talk about individual case because they be all different with different circumstance the order be about financial deterrent against those kind of action different sanction be available for the mistreatment of employee such as civil or criminal investigation by the insolvency service different measure can be take forward where rule be not comply with be grateful to the minister for give way again he talk about the extra put off business and employer from go down that route if it will save business heck of lot more money than the alternative surely they will go down the same route they will potentially price in the if it will save they more money in the long run particularly in british airways situation where it be deal with legacy contract and try to save substantial amount of money surely this be not enough of disincentive the hon gentleman raise an interesting point most employer treat their employee with dignity and respect that be what we expect and what we see in the vast majority of case an economic environment in which we have virtually full employment mean competitive market for employee that be the good protection against the kind of approach that some employer take and which we be try mitigate we believe the measure strike fair balance we believe there be situation where dismissal and re engagement be appropriate can expand on that if he would like to so it be about try to strike balance and we think we have strike that balance thank the minister for give way on that point do he appreciate that many of we think the code look very optimistic presume good case scenario in human behaviour and industrial relation and that the result be really toothless in deal with company that might operate outwith the norm do not think so there be financial deterrent to go down route that be not appropriate and to not follow the code as say we be strike balance there be situation in which as last resort business need to do something more drastic for example business might be in peril and unable to survive without make the kind of change we be discuss and such case have come before tribunal if the question be whether it be right that everybody share small burden say reduction in salary one person can not hold out against that and prevent restructuring that be in the interest of the many rather than the few the provision have be use in the past to save business and therefore job that be what we be try to protect while also protect against rogue employer use such opportunity irresponsibly and unfairly the code will apply to all employer regardless of size we expect all employer in relevant scenario to adhere to it as say employment tribunal will have the power to apply an uplift of up to of an employee compensation if an employer unreasonably fail to comply with code that apply in accordance with the trade union and labour relations consolidation act the secretary of state consult acas on draft statutory code before publish it between january and april the government publicly consult on draft code enable trade union employer and other interested party to contribute their view careful consideration be give to those view and as result change be make to the draft code the government be very grateful to all respondent to the consultation for their consider and helpful response an update draft code be lay before parliament on february and government response to the consultation be publish on the same day the draft code be then debate in both houses of parliament be pleased to say that it be approve the government will introduce separate legislation to bring the code into force before summer recess the government be go even far by bring forward this order which will increase the deterrent effect of the code by add protective award where there be non compliance with the collective consultation requirement in schedule to the act the protective award be compensation award by an employment tribunal when an employer do not consult with its employee before dismiss or more of they within any day period at single establishment schedule to the act set out the list of claim for which an employment tribunal can make adjustment to compensation if one of the party have unreasonably fail to comply with code of practice make use power in section of the act the relevant code of practice that will be impact by this change be the code of practice on dismissal and re engagement the change will mean that where an employment tribunal be make protective award and it appear to it that the employer have unreasonably fail to comply with the code the tribunal may increase that award by up to the change be call for by respondent to the consultation include trade union and will increase the deterrent effect of the code there be call to ban the practice of dismissal and re engagement or to restrict the practice in manner that effectively amount to ban the government believe that we must preserve company flexibility so that they can manage their workforce in time of crisis the uk flexible labour market be key to economic growth and help business to thrive so it be right that we have mechanism to enable we to save as many job as possible the code be proportionate response to controversial fire and rehire practice balance protection for employee with business flexibility the vast majority of employer want to do the right thing by their employee for most employer decision to change term and condition or to let member of the workforce go be not take lightly the uk be great place to start and grow business it have strong labour market and its success be underpin by the balance between labour market flexibility and worker protection it be vital that we continue to strike the right balance while clamp down on poor practice the government intend the code and the order to be in effect before the summer recess commend the order to the house call the shadow minister let begin by refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests be grateful to the minister for introduce the debate and for make the necessary amendment to primary legislation so soon after the code of practice be approve it have take we more than two year but today we see the first actual legislative change to tackle the blight of dismissal and re engagement or fire and rehire as it be more commonly know we will not oppose today motion but we be clear that the order do not go anywhere near far enough towards end this cruel practice or meet the promise make by the government during the two year since we witness those disgraceful scene at it have continue to benefit from taxpayer cash through government contract and fire and rehire hasusb continue to toxify our industrial relation landscape while the ferries case itself do not entirely constitute fire and rehire it bear many of the hallmark of the practice and expose the gap hole in our law hole that continue to be exploit in the wake of the pandemic there have be jump in the number of instance of employer choose to fire and rehire worker accord to research conduct by the chartered institute of personnel and development between august and the proportion of firm that conduct fire and rehire almost double what be once seldom use device have become mainstream practice and part of the wide pattern of grow insecurity at work in short it have become first choice rather than last resort tuc investigation find that about employer be still use fire and rehire as tactic however when we be finally give the code that we be promise would tackle this dickensian practice we find instead vague weak and disappointing document that would not actually prevent another case as egregious as on that basis alone the government have fail to keep the promise that they make more than two year ago the element that many people find most offensive about the case which today motion seek to address be the fact that the management be able to look at the sanction for which they be potentially liable and then decide whether or not they want to abide by the law in effect the cost of break the law be consider to be just another business overhead to be factor into decision making and as we see the management decide that those sanction be not strong enough deterrent to prevent rule breaking in its response to the consultation acas say that penalty may not always present significant deterrent when calculate against the financial cost and risk of an alternative approach raise exactly those concern at the time in relation to the hon gentleman be make powerful argument and incidentally congratulate the minister on the motion but the critical factor be the size of the business involve very large business can absorb all kind of cost that small local firm can not that have be the change and the regulation that we put in place need to reflect that change because otherwise those large business will behave with impunity will refer to other comment make by acas in response to the consultation which think will pick up some of the right hon gentleman observation we now have clear indication that unscrupulous employer can not get away scot free with break the law but there be concern that uplift will not be enough to deter bad employer who be determined to do what they feel be necessary once have calculate the maximum penalty that it could face in compensation for each employee it price that into its decision in effect it be able to treat the law on consultation law that be there to protect worker job and their dignity as optional today motion mean that break the law will remain an option it just might be slightly more expensive one now law be only as strong as their enforcement we believe that sanction should reflect the egregiousness of the transgression if an employer decide to break the law the sanction should not be cap but instead should be decide on the basis of the fact that would mean that any employer who be tempt to brazenly flout their legal obligation have calculate the cost of break the law would no long be able to do so because the cost of the sanction could in the most serious case be much high than the cost of comply with the law small transgression would be treat accordingly by tribunal as thing stand the most egregious abuse have cost ceiling so those with ill intent can still price in the cost of act unlawfully in its response to the consultation acas say that there be ground for consider whether additional or alternative financial disincentive might help the government policy objective include great uplift of award where this be just and equitable or where there be especially egregious breach of the code it also suggest this be relevant to the intervention from the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes that when decide appropriate award court and tribunal might be require to consider for example whether the employer ought to have know well than to breach the code the degree of legal advice readily available to it and its financial resource we agree with those suggestion the arrogant uncaring and deliberate trampling of worker right require strong message from this place that those action will no long be tolerate bad employer should not be able to buy their way out of do the right thing but instead we see the status quo preserve thankfully many good employer understand the importance of work collaboratively with union we commend those employer and we know that they already go above and beyond the legal requirement but there be no evidence that the uplift be likely to prove deterrent to those who do not the government do not know how often the compensatory uplift be use in other area of employment law where there be similar penalty for transgress code of practice which prompt we to ask on what basis it have be decide that this measure will be effective in prevent employer from fail to follow the code of practice we welcome the fact that the order extend the scope of compensation to any situation in which protective award under section of the trade union and labour relations consolidation act be applicable understand that to mean that more traditional redundancy situation will be cover but there be limitation there must be or more employee at the same establishment for the obligation to be activate which mean that many small employer and probably more pertinently many more employer whose workforce may be spread across many different setting retail be an obvious example can still be exclude the measure also only protect employee which mean that some of the most insecure worker in the labour market will not benefit one jot and of course the government intend to reintroduce employment tribunal fee which as we know from experience inhibit people from enforce their right the regulation also provide for reduction in compensation when an employee unreasonably fail to comply with the code of practice during last month debate on the code ask the minister what element of the case or indeed any recent mass redundancy exercise have lead he to believe that such provision be necessary be afraid that do not receive satisfactory response then so will ask the question again be it not the case that nothing in recent high profile example of fire and rehire redundancy have make it necessary to give tribunal the power to take away compensation from employee we will not oppose the motion because it be step albeit small one in the right direction but let make it absolutely clear that what be before we will not prevent another case as egregious as that of it have take we two year to reach this point two year in which we have see grow insecurity at work and have come no close to provide the protection that worker in this country deserve when the government commit themselves to respond to the outrage of there be moment of consensus across the business world across the political spectrum and indeed across the whole country that this disgraceful practice should be consign to the history book epitomise that consensus the then business secretary the right hon member for welwyn hatfield grant shapps say we will not allow this to happen again where new law be need we will create they where legal loophole be cynically exploit we will close they and where employment right be too weak we will strengthen they official report march vol those legal loophole remain as open as they do two year ago and there be nothing absolutely nothing to prevent the outrage of happen again that be yet another example of the long list of wrong that will need labour government to put they right it be time to end the race to the bottom it be time to end fire and rehire too refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests when see the order paper and an item title term and conditions of employment think that it be good news after the time the government have commit to an employment bill perhaps we would actually see it think that nearly seven year on from the taylor review of which almost recommendation have not be enact or bring before the house we would have an opportunity to create dignity fairness and an inclusive labour market lead to fair and more equal nation but what we have today be snail step albeit one that will welcome with some qualification the reality be that for thousand of worker across these island term and condition of employment see too many work people become victim at the mercy of boss look to cut cost which be exactly what fire and rehire be about it be also about zero hour contract bogus self employment and short notice of shift change leave worker with additional transport and childcare cost but want to concentrate on the evil practice of fire and rehire my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands who have have to go to committee have table two private member bills that seek to outlaw fire and rehire practice the bills be support by over mp and the trade union unite the british airline pilots association and gmb listen carefully to the minister exchange with my hon friend and the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine and my scepticism about the order be approve today relate to what would happen in tribunal case for unfair dismissal where re engagement order be place on an employer follow dismissal and the tribunal order reinstatement we all know that very few case in which tribunal tell an employer to reinstate worker who have be dismiss lead to reinstatement because employer will absorb the additional cost for fail to reinstate welcome the fact that there will be penalty where fire and rehire have take place but the same principle be at play here be afraid my scepticism relate to the fact that as those on the labour front bench have say this order will not end the practice of fire and rehire large employer will get their calculator out and absorb the cost like we have see with british airways and see the business and trade committee extraordinary exchange with chief executive last week want to see real sanction so ask the minister to write to we and tell we how many tribunal case where there have be an order to reinstate have actually lead to reinstatement understand that the rate could be as low as but would be curious to know the figure because suspect that they could tell we what would happen with fire and rehire practice agree with my hon friend but will not company such as british airways and asda which have indulge in this behaviour look at this as balance sheet exercise and conclude that the penalty be so small that they can ride it out do that not make the case for the government bring forward an employment bill to deal with the issue agree that there should be an employment bill but exactly as my hon friend have outline our concern would be that large employer will get the calculator out and decide to absorb the cost they will then as they see it take small financial hit from pay penalty than they would for fire and rehire it be an evil practice and hope the government will now consider end fire and rehire thank hon member for their contribution and will address their specific point as we have discuss this issue before in separate venue fully understand that the shadow minister the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders do not feel that this order go far enough it be interesting to consider the briefing that come from recent discussion in the labour party about its new plan for the workplace there be briefing that the party accept some situation where dismissal and re engagement may be need that may be vicious rumour but it seem to that those on the labour front bench decide their policy on the basis of whom they have talk to last whether that be business employer or employee representative we remain committed to ban fire and rehire but if the minister want to debate our policy properly let we have general election and see what the public think why wait let we have the debate now the shadow minister mention as do many other hon and right hon member clearly that be not situation involve fire and rehire there be an ongoing investigation and we believe that break the law follow that situation we introduce the seafarers wages act to ensure that any company that operate vessel in british water will pay the national living wage which will be an effective measure the hon member for glasgow south west chris stephens describe fire and rehire as an evil practice which be not the right kind of language there be situation where sometimes employer do the wrong thing by their employee but most employer do the right thing there be business that have no alternative other than fire and rehire in order to save the business and save job to describe every situation involve dismissal and re engagement as an evil practice be entirely the wrong kind of language the minister be be typically generous in give way surely dismiss people and re engage they on bad term and condition and in many case on low wage many multinational company try to get away with that and some do get away with it during the pandemic be an evil practice there be case where these opportunity be abuse do not deny that but the hon gentleman be operate on the basis that it be the exception rather than the rule it be our view which he may disagree with that the vast majority of employer do not treat their employee that way there have be case where court have uphold the right of an employer to fire and rehire where the employer try to restructure the company to save job through salary reduction of few per cent for everyone in the workplace that be well than the business go down the hon gentleman must see that there be some situation in which it be the only option for an employer which operate in the interest of the wide workforce it be the right thing to do in those situation his describe it as an evil practice be wrong and miss the point although there be abuse of the system as he describe unusually find myself disagree with my hon friend the member for glasgow south west chris stephens be there not scenario in which the government think that it be perfectly fine for somebody to be sack and re engaged for example when the government lead by the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss be collapse ministers resign and be then reappointe afterwards sometimes it be in the government interest to have that option be it well there be no recourse to an employment tribunal in that situation and there be certainly no uplift in the compensation that might be receive say to the shadow minister that he should frame the order in its context the majority of business in this country do the right thing by their employee because they be run by honourable people and treat employee well be the right thing to do for business reason his approach of ban dismissal and re engagement would cost job as would have day one right in the area of unfair dismissal bring forward single category of worker would also cost job and would create huge difficulty for many sector it be not just about the situation that arise in individual circumstance it be about the fear of those situation arise for business when they be try new employee that situation will strike fear into the heart of many business across this country and will cost job the hon member for glasgow south west chris stephens ask how many people have appear before an employment tribunal and then be reinstate do not know those number but would be happy to see what number we can find for he on that basis this order will increase the deterrent effect of the code by add the protective award for non compliance with collective consultation requirement to schedule of the act that will mean that where an employer be find to have unreasonably fail to comply with their collective consultation requirement as well as unreasonably fail to comply with the code the employment tribunal may increase the employee protective award by up to subject to the approval of both houses the code and the order will be enforce before the summer recess the government be commit to make the uk the most dynamic place in the world to work and to launch grow and do business the uk flexible labour market be key to economic growth and help business to thrive however labour market flexibility must be balance with appropriate safeguard the house should be leave in no doubt that this government will always continue to stand behind worker and stamp out unscrupulous practice where they occur question put and agree to resolve that the draft trade union and labour relations consolidation act amendment of schedule order which be lay before this house on april be approve employment allocation of tips pm beg to move that the draft code of practice on fair and transparent distribution of tips which be lay before this house on april be approve the code of practice which will refer to as the code will give legal effect to standard in the allocation and distribution of tip gratuity and service charge and transparency surround the keeping of record and the retention of write tipping policy for brevity will refer to tip gratuity and service charge as tip for the rest of today debate passage of this code will signal landmark moment in our protection of worker right for the first time the government be ensure cast iron clarity about where tip be go once they have be pay and set new standard for how tip should be treat the minister say that for brevity he would consider tip gratuity and service charge all to be tip but surely service charge which be set charge against some practice or service be quite different from tip which be for fun or voluntary gratuity come somewhere between the two do they not could he kindly enlarge on the definition of those three thing it be our position that they amount to the same thing we know from customer behaviour that when customer see service charge on their bill they will usually not tip at that point because they believe that the service charge be tip we feel that that be in the same category which be why we have categorise they together in this instance the employment allocation of tips act be relatively simple piece of legislation but one with an important purpose follow the justify public examination few year ago of the spectacle of some business retain significant percentage of tip or even keep they altogether the government commit to back private member bill on tipping the law mandate that all qualifying tip must be pass on to the worker who earn they rather than be retain by business and it set out that these tip must be allocate and distribute in fair and transparent manner reiterate my appreciation which set out at this dispatch box early this year for the cross party support that the primary legislation engender and for the positive and constructive tone in which all the parliamentary stage be conduct want to extend further thank in particular to the original bill sponsor my hon friend the members for watford dean russell and for ynys môn virginia crosbie and subsequently lord robathan in the house of lords today we be another step close to bring these important measure into effect it be remark at the time that the detail be crucial and we elaborate on that detail in december with the publication of the draft statutory code of practice on fair and transparent distribution of tip be grateful for the large volume and quality of the response we receive during the public consultation that follow everyone who provide feedback whether via an online survey through an email response or in meeting with official at my department should know that their view have be consider carefully response have be use to amend and enhance the code and will continue to inform the communication and support for business implement these measure we be pleased to lay the update code of practice before parliament on monday april the code be also publish on alongside full government response to the consultation which provide more detail on the feedback receive from business worker and other stakeholder trust that right hon and hon member have have or will have the opportunity to study the detail of the code in their own time but will briefly set out its provision here today the code of practice contain summary of the key intention of the act the code set out the scope of this legislation emphasise that it cover all qualifying tip that is employer receive tip and worker receive tip over which an employer exert control or significant influence these measure apply to every sector and across england scotland and wales the code go on to provide more detail on the need to maintain fairness in the allocation and distribution of tip rather than be prescriptive and potentially burdensome to employer the code articulate key principle for employer to consider protect both the right of worker and flexibility for variety of approach from business the code help employer to engage in constructive and positive consultation with their worker and help to minimise the risk of discrimination which may be indirect or unintentional if due care be not take the code set out that employer need to uphold transparency in the handling of tip this include keep write tipping policy that be clearly communicate to all affected worker this requirement also include retain accurate tipping record to which worker have the right to request access one thing to note be that this need to maintain write tipping policy and make it available to worker do not apply to business that receive tip only on an occasional and exceptional basis finally the code expand on how to resolve conflict that arise between employer and worker while early and internal resolution of issue be preferable for all involve worker may consult acas for impartial advice and assistance in resolve problem the code inform worker about how an unresolved dispute may be escalate to an employment tribunal be listen to the minister carefully be sorry that be not as familiar with the original act should be and apologise if ask foolish question as result he mention moment ago that the code of practice would not apply to industry in which tipping occur only rarely will he expand on what those be for example if tip taxi driver would it apply to that obviously not if tip waiter in restaurant because he have be particularly helpful to why should that be share with other people in the restaurant to what sort of industry would the code not apply as say early that provision do not apply to an industry or organisation that receive tip on an occasional or exceptional basis an example would be christmas box or christmas present for somebody or an industry that be not use to get those kind of gift my hon friend talk about the taxi industry which be an industry in which people regularly receive tip he also talk about situation where customer give tip directly to worker that tip can be keep by the worker if it be give directly to that worker and be not in the control of the employer that be the difference tip give directly to somebody in restaurant or some other place can be keep by that individual we would expect that to be set out in policy at employer level want to take this opportunity to place on the record the government gratitude to acas and all those involve in the tribunal system for their continue diligence on tipping and many other matter of employment law overall the government be proud today to endorse the approval of this code of practice follow approval by this house and by the house of lords the code and the other measure in the act will come into force on tuesday october with this code of practice the government be right wrong deliver level playing field for business and continue our proud record of stand up for and defend the right of worker commend the statutory code of practice on fair and transparent distribution of tip to the house thank the minister for his introduction once again refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests also join the minister in pay tribute to the hon member for watford dean russell and for ynys môn virginia crosbie for their work on the private member bill that lead to where we be today as the minister outline we be finally here to debate the code of practice on fair and transparent distribution of tip which be necessary to deliver the provision of the employment allocation of tips act say finally not just because it have take year since royal assent for code to be agree but because it have be seven year since action be first promise on tip as far back as the conservatives promise to ensure fair tip for hospitality worker in that time it be estimate that worker will have miss out on some million year in lose tip that be over billion take from worker in some of the economy low pay job it be little disappointing to see that the government have delay the act implementation from july until october by our calculation this further delay will cost people in the hospitality sector another million with that out of the way make it clear that we will not oppose the code action on tip be already long overdue and we do not want to see it delay any long we believe that these measure will have positive impact on the life of worker in the hospitality sector and other industry that frequently receive tip but we also consider that there be room for improvement will refer to those specific issue in due course however start by refer to the government consultation which starkly set out why action be need the proportion of respondent who report that they do not receive the tip to which they be entitle be very significant only half of those who complete the consultation report that staff receive all the tip of course this mean that half the respondent to the consultation do not extrapolate across those work in the sector around million worker will benefit from this legislation of those report that staff do not receive all the tip report that there be an administrative fee another say there be other deduction and staggering report that no tip be pass on at all it be jar that in the face of such clear mistreatment of worker there have be such delay to get to this point that the government choose to delay the implementation of the act after discover the staggering statistic in the consultation rub little salt into the wound some of worker who respond to the consultation report that their employer have not seek agreement on the allocation of tip and of employer consult do not pass on tip to agency worker in part or in total which clearly need to be address and it will be by this legislation these statistic may be reason why we face another delay because clearly lot of business need to get up to speed in order to be compliant which beg the question of why more have not be do before now will the minister outline the government approach to work with business to ensure that they be aware of their obligation under the new law what step will the department take to ensure support in the area where business raise concern in the consultation such as transparency and record keeping on tip allocation and distribution be particularly interested in how the department plan to engage with small and medium sized enterprise to ensure that they remain compliant with the law once it come into effect worker will benefit only if employer be aware of and compliant with the law so it would be welcome to hear the government plan draw the house attention to couple of specific element of the code paragraph on employer consult their workforce on the policy seem pretty minimal in set out what good consultation look like if an individual make an employment tribunal claim do the minister envisage there be any opportunity for there to be an examination of the quality of the consultation the very important point at paragraph need further clarification it say that employer should review their allocation policy on regular basis but there be no indication of the timescale within which this should take place do the minister have view on what the timescale might be we be deal with workforce who might change quite regularly that lead to the question of enforcement repeat the old adage that people right be only as strong as their ability to enforce they the sector to which the act predominantly apply be make up of worker in insecure low pay job that be generally in non unionised workplace staff turnover be high mean that many worker do not stay with the same employer or even within the same industry for long period of time these factor will doubtless have an impact on worker ability to assert the right afford under the act many may be entirely unaware of the stipulation of the act even if they be aware of the stipulation they might not always be aware of the way in which they can enforce they particularly if the government persist with their plan to reintroduce employment tribunal fee it may well not be financially viable for people to assert their right as the fee for lodge claim might well be more than worker be seek to claim back more fundamentally worker on zero hour contract or in another form of insecure work may fear that assert their right will be detrimental to their future chance of receive work for example if worker on zero hour contract be concerned that they have be underpaid the tip to which they be entitle and request to view their tipping record as be their right under the act their employer might consider this behaviour to be stir the pot and choose to reduce the hour they give that worker or possibly even to stop give they work at all worker with less than two year service can be dismiss without cause and have no claim for unfair dismissal the legislation do not cater for people to claim that they have be unfairly dismiss for assert their statutory right under the act if that be the case it be huge oversight give that there be protection against unfair dismissal for assert most other statutory right will the minister consider look at this point again as there be real concern that unless people have legal protection and confidence that the law be on their side they may be reluctant to avail themselves of their right in term of the impact on the tribunal system have the government make an assessment of the propensity of those in the hospitality sector to take forward claim have modelling be do to judge the expect number of worker who will take forward tribunal claim it seem to that the lack of proper protection will mean that the minority of bad employer will be able to continue operate with impunity withhold the tip that their worker have rightfully earn as minimum would expect there to be some monitoring of the legislation effectiveness perhaps through survey or consultation after all paragraph of the code state an employer can not be say to have meet its obligation to handle tip fairly and transparently if individual worker be not aware of their entitlement in line with the tipping policy if we be to have confidence that those word mean something surely we need monitoring to ensure that the code be effective there be couple of other issue that would like to raise first on when worker be entitle to receive their tip for give month the code make reference to the provision that tip must be pay by the end of the next month there be question about why tip be not pass over on the same schedule as most worker be pay secondly accord to paragraph tip by app be judge to be out of scope of the legislation can the minister confirm exactly what tip by app mean take it to be form of digital tipping akin to leave cash but we need some clarity will he outline what work the department have do to identify the type of tipping practice that will be in scope there be concern that although tipping by app might not be widespread now it could be see as way to avoid obligation under the act in certain circumstance to prevent staff from get the tip that be intend for they in summary we welcome the fact that the government have finally get to the stage of be able to implement this policy sadly we will have to wait another five month for it to be implement but the change set out today will have positive impact on worker who for too long have be lose money that be always intend for they we will monitor the progress of this legislation closely and if necessary take further step to ensure the good intention behind this act be deliver in full it be proud moment for to stand here today because bring in the private member bill behind this change and be able to get it over the line with the able effort and support of my hon friend the member for ynys môn virginia crosbie it be joyous day because be absolutely passionate about two thing fairness and watford and we have some fantastic hospitality location in watford our cafés and restaurant include jamaica blue the flourish bakery the beech house the tudor arms the sun postal sport club the badger pub rhubarb café random café cassio lounge and so many more would love everyone here to visit as often as possible because they would see delight that they would get nowhere else in the world list all those location because in each hospitality organisation in each café and restaurant there be not only people who run the business but many staff who work in it be talk about the tip bill way back when originally try to introduce it via presentation bill which do not quite make it through as have routine of never give up manage to obtain private member bill that be through luck and then get it through very much with thank to the government especially thank the minister who be on the front bench today who be do incredible work and his team this measure be so important to because would go to meet these organisation and chat to staff especially during the pandemic and they be all consistent in their concern about whether they would get to keep tip big shift take place at that time from people give cash to somebody individually towards world where cash be not so common that be not necessarily good place to be but it be the way the world have move far more people will now pay tip on credit card at the end of meal or when they leave café every one of we will have ask the same question when we have make that payment and give our tip which be will you get this my bill will help to resolve that congratulate my hon friend on his superb effort in get his bill through as it be wonderful thing to have do support the principle behind it but be slightly puzzle by one aspect should the restauranteur or bar owner not be charge the correct price for the service without any tip or service charge have to be add on should he not be pay his worker fair wage for the job they be do without any tip service charge or other thing add surely my hon friend bill will set this in stone say that even though do not like tip very much as would much rather pay fair price to the restauranteur and to the person who work for they my hon friend make an incredibly important point which get to the heart of this the fairness here be to not just the worker but the business most business do the right thing and pay decent salary the minister can correct on this but believe that legislation take through while ago mean that tip can not form part of salary so business should be pay decent wage when some organisation do the wrong thing what they be do be anti competitive they be make profit off the back of their worker by keep their tip and the business do the right thing in give of the tip to the staff be less competitive my approach be therefore far fair to the majority of business that do the right thing and to the worker it be also far fair to the customer who think that the money be go to the staff and do not realise that percentage of it or in some instance all of it be be take from they my bill will ensure fairness that be the key word we should all take from the bill and from today debate it will ensure that all tip of they be pay to staff agency staff will be include in that when originally talk about this bill some have concern about two tier system for worker the bill will also ensure that policy be in place code of practice so that business ensure that their staff know where they stand business will be able to be clear with everyone who work for they how the tipping practice will work will not go through the full list as the minister do an excellent job of list it early this measure have be journey mention my work on the bill with my hon friend the member for ynys môn but as with all journey begin this trek much early in many way this begin with the fantastic work do by my right hon friend the member for bromsgrove sir sajid javid when he be secretary of state he put in place the work enable the government to look at how we could make sure tipping be fair so this measure be build on the shoulder of giant will not list they now but many member have be involve in make sure my bill come to fruition many organisation be also involve and thank ukhospitality especially kate nicholls who have do fantastic job and the night time industries association which have do brilliant work conservative members do not often talk positively about union but the gmb have do fantastic work and should give another mention to acas lot of business employer and employee have also really push for this to come to fruition want to thank some current and former member of the government particularly my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully who be incredibly supportive when originally try to bring my legislation in as presentation bill at the time we be go to make it part of the employment bill unfortunately that do not happen but many of the policy that be go to be include do happen through various other route thank my hon friend the member for loughborough jane hunt who be fantastic supporter and an able minister of course also thank the minister before we today and his team he have be excellent in make sure that this be push forward and through he would like to thank his team some of they be my team in my short time as minister so know the passion they have about make sure that we get this right during my brief time as minister have to hand over this precious baby of mine the tip bill to colleague to make sure we could keep it move forward through the house that be when be able to speak to my hon friend the member for ynys môn who have an incredibly important hospitality industry in her constituency could not think of someone more able and more energetic to make sure that we get the bill through through her work and our work with lord robathan we make sure that it get through and receive royal assent many member will not know that on the day it be give be fortunate enough to meet the king that morning in parliament be sure that be rare story and one for pub quiz sometime in the future the other person would like to give huge thank to be the lady who rarely get mention in here but who be behind so many of these incredibly important bills my hon friend the member for castle point rebecca harris she do an incredible job in give we guidance on how to navigate the complex system of get bill through parliament and in give we confidence that it be possible she have make sure that many bills have get through and go on this incredibly important journey include many other in which have have involvement in different way such as those on flexible working maternity care leave and so on my bill will help about million hospitality worker across the uk that be an incredible number when have speak about this to people around the house or to my constituent have find that so many more people will talk about its importance customer who want to make sure that money for which they have work hard and which they be give as thank you get to the people they be give it to and colleague who have family member who work as waiter or waitress or who work in bar as this will make sure that they get the money that have be gift to they many colleague have speak to about their experience of work in hospitality while at university or when they be young that have show how the hospitality sector play an important role in our society it provide type of apprenticeship to many of we before our career we learn lot about our culture society and community as well as about people through hospitality that be why have be so passionate about save our night time economy include music venue in watford and across the uk music venue have be at the heart of our society and fear they may be damage in the future but hope the bill may play small part in help they the bill be also about fairness it be impossible to legislate for fairness in society it be gut feel but fairness be at the heart of what it be to be british we believe in fairness in all part of our society at its heart the legislation go back to the fact that when someone give money as gift to someone else they expect they to get it that be what this bill will ensure and be grateful to the government for that want to raise couple of related point with the minister to ensure they be cover as the legislation move forward we need to ensure there be communication strategy before october so that worker know their right how to access they and what be cover business also need to know that the legislation will not be burden during the early stage of the bill be mindful that it must not be burden and more red tape for business the majority of business get that and understand it those that be do the wrong thing will no doubt kick up fuss over the come week and month we will probably hear about business try to get around the regulation by form new practice hope the government will clamp down on those and name and shame the business involve will certainly be happy to do that to ensure that fairness be the heart of the regulation the government have role to play in support the hospitality sector as whole as well they can business in the sector be important part of our community they be in the heart of every village town and city hospitality be often the reason people visit an area it be often the first port of call for job and career and it play an important role in entertainment and culture no other industry have such an important and broad role so want to ensure it be fair thank the government the minister and colleague across the house who have be incredibly supportive especially my hon friend the member for ynys môn finally may say huge thank you to my constituent in watford if they have not put here the bill may not have be make progress today call the spokesperson for the scottish national party it be genuinely pleasure to follow the hon member for watford dean russell thank he and congratulate he on the private member bill that lead to this code of practice come to the floor of the house it be small but significant step forward in improve worker right regardless of our political difference suspect there be many have always find the hon gentleman to be kind thoughtful and dedicated to public service and be very grateful for that it be therefore no surprise that have win the equivalent of the parliamentary lottery he choose to bring forward legislation that command such cross party support and thank he for that will make reference to the briefing issue by unite the union later in my remark but at the outset declare my own membership of unite although should be clear that have no particular financial interest to declare one of the most frustrating aspect of the to parliament have be the lack of significant progress on improve employment law more generally yes there have be piecemeal bit of legislation such as the bills bring forward by the hon member for watford my hon friend the member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east stuart mcdonald and the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain but they have all come forward as limited back bench bills it be undeniable that vacuum be create for these private member bill to move forward due to the sheer absence of the substantial government employment bill that many of we expect indeed we be promise such bill on no less than occasion by ministers it be now seven year since the taylor review and still no action have be forthcoming from the recommendation of that report be sure the hon gentleman would like to correct the record number of recommendation in the taylor review have be implement not least the right to request predictable term and condition which go far than the recommendation in the review will the hon gentleman acknowledge that fact be absolutely willing to acknowledge that some recommendation from the taylor review have be progress but no significant action have be forthcoming lot of mp have say that indeed even the hon member for watford say it be regrettable that there be not an employment bill be simply point out the fact that an employment bill be promise in this parliament we find time to legislate on whole manner of other issue some of which have frankly be with view to create wedge at the general election whereas we know that the legislation framework we have around employment law be not necessarily fit for the century and the kind of economy we now have the uk exit the european union in january to the cheer and trumpet of brexiteers who promise that britannia unchain from brussels would lead to an improvement in worker right in reality and from what can see in glasgow all that have happen be that employer in the hospitality and tourism sector now just have few worker in cite the briefing from unite want to thank it for the work it have do to engage with employee and to gauge their opinion about tip policy for context those who have respond be already engage trade unionist with track record of activism and decent understanding of policy that be what make the answer particularly striking when ask whether an employee workplace pass on all tip to its staff the answer be yes do know no and some indicate that tip be only accept by card on an employer operate tronc that employee pay tax on those statistic paint picture of the sheer scale of the issue worker face especially when it come to tipping in hospitality on tipping policy some other issue need to be iron out and consider far namely whether backroom staff such as those who be integral to prepare and produce meal not just deliver it to the table be tip and whether the tip be be distribute equitably all worker need to be eligible to receive tip whether they be on zero hour contract or be permanent progress have be make on extend tip to agency worker but in reality we now operate in gig economy it be vital that the legislative framework that come from this place reflect that from the government response to the consultation of employer admit that they do not issue tip to agency worker despite that be an obligation under section of the employment rights act the hon member for watford be spot on when he say that the comms to employer and employee must be very clear in the run up to october this year there must be something that can be do for example with employee who still receive payslip could the government bring forward measure to require all employer to put some sort of small note on payslip to make clear that the law on tipping will change in couple of month the legislation we be pilot through the house today make the point that our legislative framework do not reflect the reality of the uk economy and labour force in more need to be do to protect worker especially those on zero hour contract arguably that point should weigh heavily on the mind of shadow ministers who if poll be to be believe might shortly be assume red box and whitehall office in the come month as we approach the cigarette end of this parliament attention turn to the incoming government and their ambition for worker right it would be fair to say that the small conservative approach to worker right from the official opposition have not necessarily be wholly welcome by those in the labour movement only last week unite general secretary sharon graham be on record as say it look like all the warning unite make early about the danger of labour row back on its pledge for the new deal for workers have be prove right this new labour document on the new deal issue to the union on monday be row back on row back it be totally unrecognisable from the original proposal produce with the union unrecognisable worker will see through this and mark this retreat after retreat as betrayal this new document be turn what be real new deal for worker into charter for bad boss labour do not want law against fire and rehire and they be effectively rip up the promise of legislation on new deal for worker in its first day order assume the hon gentleman will be come back to the motion before we be very happy to inform you madam deputy speaker that be talk on employment legislation which believe be germane to this debate unite general secretary go on to say instead we have code of conduct and pledge of consultation with big business likewise the proposal to legislate against zero hour contract be water down to almost nothing in truth this new document be not worthy of discussion all union must now demand that labour change course and put the original new deal for workers back on the table that be warning shot to the labour party that it too must be more ambitious and not leave the task of protect worker right to the valiant effort of back bench mp who happen to be lucky in the private members bill draw be sure that you will be glad to know madam deputy speaker that will draw my remark to close and say yes the measure before we today have the potential to put up to million year back into the pocket of hospitality staff and could benefit more than million worker across the hospitality leisure and service sector that be legislative achievement to be rightly celebrate in this place but it come against backdrop of increase legislation that restrict the right of trade union to exercise function of collective bargaining it be no surprise therefore that the uk now have some of the most restrictive trade union law in western europe something that have worsen over the past decade worker deserve well and today be another baby step to improve thing but it largely go against the grain of westminster policy formulation when it come to worker right and it be frankly little wonder that the labour movement in scotland so ably represent by the scottish trades union congress have now conclude that legislative competence for employment law should be devolve to scottish ministers failure to do so be that by labour or the tories will lead scot to conclude one thing and one thing only that westminster be not work for work people be delighted to be speak on the day that this code of practice be approve by this house when take over the sponsorship of the employment allocation of tips bill private member bill due to his promotion of my hon friend the member for watford dean russell champion for watford know just how important it would be to the pocket of million of people across the uk particularly in my constituency the bill be about fairness and transparency it be about reduce discrimination and it be about create level playing field for business importantly the code will enable dispute to be resolve quickly and fairly some of people in the uk work in the tourism sector that rise to in wales and whopping on ynys môn that be right almost one in five be employ in the tourism and hospitality sector in my constituency of ynys môn if as be estimate worker in the sector will receive an average per year more in their pocket then rough calculation suggest that this measure alone could generate around for worker across ynys môn annually as someone who finance my level and university study by waitress know at first hand how important tip be madam deputy speaker this bill be not new nuclear power station or freeport but it be significant to local worker and family struggle with the cost of living have to say that those work in hospitality and tourism on anglesey be fantastic bunch and be dedicate to support our local community in so many way the team in the oystercatcher in rhosneigr be work with community champion sue gillett to help raise fund for mirili môn as part of dementia week this thursday at catch in valley neil mel and the team support local farmer through their farmer market the driftwood in trearddur bay host fabulous quiz to raise fund for local community group such as the scouts the ssafa and the royal national lifeboat institution and dave and amanda jones from anglesey fishing trips do so much to reach out to tourist and to our local community there be so many fantastic people and community that will benefit from this measure particularly those on ynys môn and be proud to see that with the approval of this code of practice this legislation be move another step close thank hon member for their contribution to this debate in which we be seek to ensure that the draft code of practice on fair and transparent distribution of tip be approve will turn now to the specific issue raise the shadow minister talk about engage with the sector which be very important can tell he that we engage regularly with organisation such as uk hospitality the british beer and pub association and the british institute of innkeeping on these matter and have be do so for many month as we want to make sure that their view be hear the non statutory guidance that we will be bring forward should provide more help for those organisation to comply with the important provision of this legislation the shadow minister ask whether we would review the policy on regular basis we will obviously keep all these matter under review and the guidance should help to inform the sector about requirement in term of both employee and business it be hugely important that we do so he ask whether person could take claim forward to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal clearly employment tribunal be there to ensure that worker can assert their right if they feel that their right have not be respect so we would definitely expect an employment tribunal to hear such case the shadow minister ask about tipping by digital app we see this as new phenomenon and an interesting development enable the customer to be able to tip an individual use an app qr code or whatever and we will not stand in the way of that where tip have be give directly to member of staff it be clear that that tip should be keep by the member of staff the app be there to allow flexibility in the implementation of the code or the guidance rather than allow business to avoid their clear obligation the shadow minister ask about payment and why they be pay the follow month think it be reasonable to allow business to be able to calculate the amount of tip that be receive in month and then pay those out to worker in the month follow we think that that be reasonable balance to strike he ask why we be take another five month to put this legislation in place clearly we want to ensure two thing that we get this right and that we respect some of the pressure that exist in the hospitality sector which have be through difficult time with increase in the national living wage the cost of live crisis and the covid pandemic we be try to make sure that we take the sector with we rather than impose unfair new burden on it we do not think that these measure be unfair because we know that the majority of business would adopt these kind of rule even without this legislation the hon member for glasgow east david linden seem to imply that we on the conservative benches be go to use brexit to improve worker right be always keen to improve worker right and we have do so in this parliament but remember his party clearly say that brexit would be bonfire of worker right and that certainly have not be the case do the minister consider that worker right have improve if he do why be it that trade union organisation across europe recognise that the uk have some of the bad employment right across europe yes those right have get well we have introduce legislation that cover the right to request flexible working neonatal care leave carer leave protection to cover redundancy during pregnancy and return to work the right to request predictable term and condition the tipping bill and share parental leave all those thing have be introduce or support by this government we see those protection not as an opportunity to create wedge issue but as the right thing to do by our worker be the minister seriously try to tell the house that the former secretary of state the right hon member for welwyn hatfield grant shapps do not relish the opportunity to bring forward the strikes minimum service levels act see it as wedge issue that would cause trouble with the labour party come on that be refrain that we constantly hear from the snp to be fair to the hon gentleman he do refer to ensure that we work alongside hospitality on the guidance but apart from that there be nothing in his remark about the need of business and the legislation be about the need of business the strike that affect this country particularly at the end of last year and in the year before last cost the hospitality sector around billion that be why we legislate as we do and we feel it be the right thing to do the hon gentleman would do well to reflect far on the need of business as well as the need of worker we believe that there be balance to be strike and he have get that balance wrong in scotland hon member need not listen to just look at the number the most recent figure for economic growth in scotland over the year from to show scotland cumulative gdp growth at england at and the whole of the uk at snp mps would do well to go back to their nation and constituency and drive economic progress forward my hon friend the member for watford dean russell who have do such good work in this area talk about fairness know he stand up for fairness and for watford have see the amazing montage of all the time that he have mention watford in this chamber he deserve plaudit for his work he say that he be lucky but as the great gary player say the hard you work the lucky you get the success that my hon friend have be an instigator of today be due to his hard work and determination he talk about what we have do on communication work with employer group employee group and the hospitality sector yes we do that we work with trade union acas ukhospitality the british beer and pub association the british institute of innkeeping and other to ensure that the code of practice and the guidance that will follow will leave they fully cognisant of the requirement on the sector sector that be so important to our economy my hon friend the member for north wiltshire james gray say he do not like give tip he be free not to give tip if he do not feel it be appropriate but most people would say that for good service they would be prepare to provide tip the key point of this legislation be that that tip should be retain by the individual who provide the service may correct the impression my hon friend have give of what say do not say that do not like give tip like give tip be quite generous tipper think however wish do not have to wish people be pay enough to make tip unnecessary that be the point be make my hon friend make very good point of course we have increase the national minimum wage by record amount this year to try to make sure that people get pay enough it do surprise to think that he would not be generous tipper because he have be generous in all my interaction with he finally my hon friend the member for ynys môn virginia crosbie talk about her constituent and the benefit that the code will in her constituency think she say she do great job for her constituent must say that my daughter be both pretty pleased with the code as well as they both work in local establishment when the code and other provision on tipping come into force in october we will right wrong and ensure that tip money go where it should to the worker who provide the service we will continue to monitor the operation of the code and the major industry that it cover and we will not hesitate to amend it with parliamentary approval of course if necessary can also confirm that additional non statutory guidance will be publish before the code come into force to provide further background and help employer to remain compliant with the requirement commend the motion to the house question put and agree to resolve that the draft code of practice on fair and transparent distribution of tips which be lay before this house on april be approve business of the

to community particularly to engage with young generation to pass on our history as the world war recede far into the past we commend the commission for make education and outreach key priority in its late very good strategy be remind of the fantastic interactive event organise for young people in plymouth for the anniversary of the blitz as well as tour and talk across the country during this war graves week also encourage member to share the library of free learning resource on the commission website include guide on how to research relative and other commonwealth casualty look forward to the future welcome the commission strategy towards not least for the serious thought that have be give to how to engage young people with new technology in digital age as we mark war graves week we must recognise and honour fully the regiment and the troop draw from across the commonwealth from africa asia and the caribbean and remember the great contribution and sacrifice from so many of they that help forge modern britain and the freedom we enjoy today as the commonwealth war graves commission find in its report on the historical inequality in commemoration an estimate to casualty predominantly indian east and west african egyptian and somali personnel be or be commemorate unequally want to praise the work of our shadow foreign secretary my right hon friend the member for tottenham mr lammy who speak out about this in his documentary the unremembered in to make the case that everyone who serve in our military regardless of background and where they come from should be remember for the sacrifice they make finally make one further point the commonwealth war graves commission do superb work and remember people whose graf be on land but its remit do not extend to those who die at sea as devonport mp and come from naval family want to place it on record that those who die at sea and have no rest place other than the ocean should also be remember in war graves week in raise concern about the second world war wreck in the east java sea in particular hms exeter devonport base world war two heavy cruiser that have be loot and scavenge as war grave hms exeter and indeed hms prince of wales hms electra hms encounter and australian and dutch ship that go down in the battle with the japanese navy there should be final place of rest but those ship have be scavenge and in the case of hms exeter almost completely removed from the seabed the hon gentleman make an extremely important point about these ship that go down just off indonesia some people die on board and they be not commemorate at the site of their death at all they be the only service people who be not the same incidentally apply to those who die in dogger bank where mineral be now be lift out greatly risk interfere with the people who terribly sadly die there there be an argument for the commonwealth war graves commission to at least consider look again at war graf at sea be grateful for that intervention and the way in which the hon gentleman remember those who die in the dogger bank in hms kent place memorial next to where hms exeter go down there be way of remember those who die at sea as well as protect wreck we could look at how our ally the united states of america australia and the netherlands for example do thing slightly differently but we should be make the case that the story of all should be tell regardless of whether they die on land or at sea and that there be place for that we be see that in the debate around war graf it be really important aspect of this that we remember these people and the war memorial speak about on plymouth hoe remember those who die at sea as well as on land it be important we remember all of they on that point the house be aware of my interest in marine archaeology have ask ministers this question repeatedly and think they be correct in say that the protection of military remains act and the protection of wrecks act afford protection to those lose at sea be grateful for that intervention be not certain that this be the precise moment when should be go into the fine detail of wreck protection and the debate around that but certainly in war graves week we need to be tell the story of all who serve and all who die and that be an important part of what the commonwealth war graves commission and other group be do it be worth place on record our recognition of that work in this debate today and always we remember those who make the ultimate sacrifice to protect other service in our armed force be the ultimate public service the commonwealth war graves commission help strengthen the bond between those who serve and the country they serve to protect labour be fully commit to build on this if give the opportunity of be in government later this year it be great honour to take part in this debate be pleased to follow the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard and welcome his support for the work

shortly have parliamentary representation on the commission mark tradition go back to the origin of the commission more than year ago our debate come in the midst of war graves week but be also timely reflection of the event in june to commemorate the liberation of europe with the anniversary of the day landing many of our constituent and many in this house will have have forebear include parent who serve during world war two last autumn visit salerno in italy where commonwealth and american force land to form beachhead on the european mainland in late more than serviceman be commemorate

to the normandy landing my wife cousin lead the special service brigade which take the pegasus bridge accompany by his brigade piper more locally one of my predecessor as mp for ludlow lieutenant colonel uvedale corbett win the distinguished service order for his action during the normandy landing and breakout all of we will have connection to those who serve during the second world war so the work of the commonwealth war graves commission should be important to we all the commission care for some war memorial and cemetery across country and territory around the globe help we all to honour and commemorate the million commonwealth servicemen and woman who lose their life through war few experience be more moving or evocative than visit any of our battlefield cemetery and see the rank of the iconic headstone that mark the graf of the fallen so magnificently maintain by the dedicated commission staff in reality the work of the commission span much more than even that along with the wide range of the commission historic preservation of world class monument and million of headstone it also have world class expertise in horticulture and the research and record management that go into sustain our database of million of casualty another of its most moving and impressive role be in the continue recovery forensic identification and respectful reburial of the remain of the fall where possible with military honour that still go on month in month out during war graves week we can all take time urge colleague across the house to do so to visit site in each of our constituency yesterday visit llandingat cemetery at the church in llandovery where there be several commonwealth graf work with ryan jones who be volunteer with the commission will the right hon gentleman pay tribute to the volunteer for their work in place such as carmarthenshire look after these graf be delighted to and the hon gentleman pre empt one of the comment will make he be absolutely right and the volunteering element to preserve the quality of the headstone be relatively recent phenomenon be sure we will touch on that in few moment there be plenty of scope to add more volunteer indeed many member might want to consider volunteer to maintain gravestone in their own constituency in south shropshire more than casualty from world war one and world war two be bury at location across the ludlow constituency with more than commemorate at bridgnorth cemetery the large site in the constituency like the hon member pay my respect at one of those site last saturday in the deconsecrated churchyard of st leonards in ludlow where volunteer help keep the war graf in as reasonable order as possible in churchyard that be no long active war graves week inaugurate only in stand as good opportunity to highlight all the work that the commonwealth war graves commission do around the world none of which would be possible without both our generous member nation funder and of course our amazing staff and volunteer with my wide interest in the environment would like to touch briefly on the commission work from sustainability and horticultural perspective there can be few organisation in the world with responsibility for sustain the environment with such diverse global footprint manage site in all climate at various elevation and with one of the wide range of flora and fauna horticulturalist work for the commission care for many native plant specie in our site across the world while that mean that the commission be curator with exceptional knowledge about those plant we be also very much challenge by global climate change the commission have commit to achieve net zero by and be utilise new approach to horticulture and memorial maintenance to reflect the change climate while reduce the use of pesticide and herbicide as well as fossil fuel place on record my thank as member of the commission audit committee to my right hon friend the defence secretary as he mention in his opening speech as chairman of the commission he show real leadership early this year in secure three year funding settlement from donor nation lead by the ministry of defence we be extremely grateful to he for that not least because that provide certainty of funding to continue the commission fine work through the inevitable uncertainty of general election and potential spending review of course the commonwealth war graves commission work be not immune from the impact of war today sadly many of the place in which the commission look after war memorial and cemetery suffer from the instability and repercussion of conflict our site in gaza have be no exception join the defence secretary in pay tribute to the work of many people both here in the uk and in our high commission in the region in help to ensure the safe evacuation of our staff and their family unfortunately our restoration work on site will have to wait while access remain impossible due to the war we face similar challenge in secure safe access to our cemetery in some other place currently include iraq iran yemen and sudan but our commitment to those site be undiminishe know that we will return to carry out our important work as soon as condition allow in three week we will be mark the anniversary of the day landing this be an important opportunity to remember the contribution of uk and commonwealth soldier in the liberation of europe from the nazis and to encourage the next generation to take up responsibility for remembrance since this may well be the last significant milestone commemoration of the day landing attend by veteran of the campaign it be particularly poignant commemoration it also highlight just how important it be that young generation take up the mantle of remembrance the commission have therefore place great emphasis on involve schoolchildren in the major programme of event in both the uk and france on and june involve veteran serve personnel and child normandy where the commission maintain cemetery and memorial that mark the graf of fall service personnel will of course be the centre point of the commemoration the commission recognise the need to maintain our relevance to future generation have spend much of the last year look far ahead at develop its strategy towards as both open speech refer to that set clear path to the anniversary of world war two increase our collaboration with parallel organisation in other country both to foster reconciliation between former adversary and to inform young generation about the human cost of war that be all the more poignant and relevant give that the first state on state war at scale since be go on in europe right now as we move beyond lifetime memory of the world war the environment in which the commission do its work be change young generation be not as directly or personally connect as old generation to world war one and world war two clearly that represent challenge but it be also the true test of our commitment to honour the fallen one that hope future generation will meet just as previous generation have thank all member here today for their support for war graves week and for the important work that the commonwealth war graves commission undertake around the world the serried rank of gravestone so well maintain by the commission leave clear impression on all who see they of the sacrifice of the fall around the world they serve as reminder to we all of the immense human cost of war and that the legacy of those who give their life depend on face down the resurgent threat to global stability that we face today it be always pleasure to follow the right hon member for ludlow philip dunne the scottish national party proudly support the valuable work of the commonwealth war graves commission in its effort to ensure that those who die in service as result of conflict be commemorate it be vital that we preserve the memory of the member of our armed service and those of commonwealth country who answer the call to serve in numerous conflict across the globe and who pay the ultimate sacrifice like other member pay tribute to the fantastic work of the commonwealth war graves commission which maintain manage and preserve war graf in more than location in country and more than million headstone across the world the war graves commission offer wonderfully unique service to enable people to identify family member who have be kill in conflict and to locate their last resting place memorial or headstone have benefit from that by be able to identify my great uncle corporal william dorans who in be an army reservist and be call to the colour on the outbreak of war and serve in the battalion royal scots fusiliers it be one of the first british battalion to

british and commonwealth soldier and number of small grave site which be immaculately maintain and present by the commonwealth war graves commission the enormity of the scale and number of those kill can only be appreciate by visit to these graveyard it be very emotional experience close to home commend and bring to the attention of the house the work of the girvan and district great war project it be establish in by couple lorna and ritchie conaghan both unpaid volunteer initially to research and identify local man who leave the area to go to war and never return through their tremendous effort research identify and record at least local man wherever possible they have produce individual service record for each of the man which be available to their family as tribute to their service and sacrifice they include number who have not previously be commemorate on local war memorial include the local man who have lose their life in the armed force while serve in the army of commonwealth

and memorial wildflower garden it involve local child in various project include the production of brightly paint poppy stone place on the graf of those who die in war to enable easy identification by people walk through the cemetery what fabulous idea in addition it work to keep alive the memory of non commonwealth personnel and those kill during time of war with connection to girvan will give just one example although there be several on november french merchant ship the ss longwy be torpedo mile off the coast of girvan in my constituency with the loss of life three of the body wash up ashore along the coastline near girvan and be then bury in the town doune cemetery the other french sailor remain in their underwater tomb without commemoration other than the three simple cross mark the graf of the man who be wash ashore there be as yet no memorial to the remainder of the crew either in france or here in scotland be pleased to say that follow significant fundraising activity both in scotland and in france have be raise to erect permanent memorial overlook the sea in memory of all sailor who be kill work start on the creation of memorial this week which will be complete by october this year one group of people who die during the world war and be often overlook be those who serve in the merchant navy in august last year be privileged to attend ceremony in girvan to unveil new memorial to commemorate merchant seaman bear locally who die at sea while serve their country new memorial such as this also commemorate all those who die at sea with no know grave and remind we of the vital contribution of the merchant navy in time of conflict the good way we can preserve the legacy of war graf keep the memorial relevant and meaningful for future generation and commemorate the sacrifice make by so many be without doubt through education just month ago claire horton cbe director general of the commonwealth war graves commission say we be at an undeniable turning point for the legacy of commemoration this year landmark anniversary may be the final major commemoration attend by veteran of day and as such represent unique opportunity to pass on the torch of commemoration from the generation who fight in the two world wars and ensure commemoration of their legacy endure for generation to come as we look to the future well education must play vital role in ensure that the lesson of the first and second world war be remember and that the importance of commemoration be understand by everyone whether they have direct and personal connection to the world wars or not our mission be for the legacy of those who die fighting for our freedom to inspire world free from conflict could not agree more education be the key and the importance of every generation know the cost of war in life lose be central finally to raise awareness and help with the preservation of memory in out of the way part of town and village and to put they fully into the public arena where all especially our child can see and feel they we might every year project name on to the wall of public building to great effect as happen on the wall of the scottish parliament in may that could be do relatively easily and replicate across the country similar to the poppy display on the elizabeth tower during remembrance day last year the commonwealth war graves commission be wonderful organisation fully deserving of continue financial support from the government and the support of the public through donation to enable it to keep alive the memory of the sacrifice of the million of man and woman who lay down their life for their country we must also continue the commemoration of remembrance sunday and wear our poppy with pride in november every year to remember those who have go before we and do not return home the good and most effective way of ensure that these memory be not lose be to educate which need to be do in manner that be accessible and relevant to child so that they can recognise the sacrifice make by so many to enable we to enjoy the precious freedom that we have today let end by quote two line of poem with which all member will be familiar at the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember they be grateful for the opportunity not only to hear the erudite word of my right hon friend the member for ludlow philip dunne but to thank he and the other member of the commonwealth war graves commission for all their work look forward to hear from the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson very shortly it be also pleasure to follow the hon member for ayr carrick and cumnock allan dorans who speak so movingly about his great uncle corporal dorans be glad that he mention the daily commemoration at the menin gate it barely let up until the second world war and resume as soon as the opportunity be available and it be wonderful that it continue to this day as the hon gentleman say and indeed as be say by the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard this be an issue on which the whole house will stand united and it be sober to think that previous generation stand here unite in grief we be surround by the commemoration of members who fall in the war and elsewhere in this place be commemorate the son and daughter of member include the son of the then prime minister herbert asquith and the then leader of the labour party arthur henderson who be kill on the same day in the battle of loos in the scale of the loss in this country and across what be then the empire require response like no other it be the hard of all task how could anyone rise to the challenge of fittingly remember so many with different faith and different tradition and from so many corner of the earth the extraordinary legacy of those include lutyens kenyon ware baker and kipling who apply themselves to that vital work most of they carry their own personal grief live on no commemoration could ever be equal to that conflict or those that follow but it do its good on behalf of this nation canada australia new zealand south africa india and the whole commonwealth to remember the sacrifice of all and the sacrifice of every individual embrace the principle of equality of commemoration it be vital for we to embrace that principle novel in its day at every opportunity in remember everyone who fall in common cause in do so we must recognise as inexcusable as do the former defence secretary my right hon friend the member for wyre and preston north mr wallace those occasion when in the past we fall short of that absolute principle the engraving that be ultimately not adopt but be initially intend to be inscribe around the stone of remembrance be take from ecclesiastes their body be bury in peace but their name liveth for evermore for the fact that where know graf exist the body of those brave man and woman do lie in peace and their name whether commemorate on memorial or on gravestone will be remember for evermore we owe an enormous debt to the commonwealth war graves commission as be suggest by my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may if we in this house could possibly thank every one of its employee in each of the language that they speak between they we would feel honoured to do so for the work that they do to fulfil our sacred obligation not least as my right hon friend the member for ludlow mention their work in continue to uncover remain and bury they with due honour they have our gratitude and respect during my research for this speech find it sober to try to find the number of graf and of course to be remind that that number grow year upon year every one of we be sure will have stand before the comme memorial with its name visit tyne cot with its graf and sometimes even more poignantly visit the quiet and small cemetery scatter across flanders field what make they so poignant be the sheer scale of collective loss with each individual headstone or name commemorate person who love and be love they be remember by their love one in the brief but most profound of epitaph how fitting it be that over year since the war to end all war schoolchildren from our constituency make annual pilgrimage to recognise and remember it be move indeed to see young people barely young than those who fall and show the same exuberance and love of life that those who die would once have claim fall silent as they recognise the enormity of just one cemetery which be only one of the cemetery and memorial look after by the cwgc of course the commission direct duty or duty work for the mod stretch far beyond the western front have be immensely move by the beautifully keep calmness of the cemetery in singapore the rise heat of dawn in the commission cemetery in new delhi as we collectively commemorate anzac day and the knowledge that in the blustery south atlantic the falkland islanders will with love protect and commemorate those bury above san carlos water who give everything for their liberation nor do the responsibility of the cwgc end with cemetery there be many individual graf in british churchyard where the fall be remember close to home the same be true of the solitary grave of ronald maxwell of the hong kong volunteer defence corps who be bury where he fall on december age beside st john cathedral in hong kong be pleased to hear the word of the secretary of state about his personal commitment to the three year uplift in funding the commission need that assurance to ensure that remembrance be live legacy for our nation and welcome it we be approach the anniversary of day date of specific significance for the commonwealth war graves commission which refer to it as the legacy of liberation the commission be right to say that the anniversary commemoration may mark tipping point between first hand memory and national memory and that the role of education will be ever more important in the year to come would therefore like my last word in this debate to be not my own but those of robert piper late of the royal sussex regiment and the royal signals he be year old normandy veteran who join up at the age of and be proud to have he as constituent he retain an excellent sense of humour when advise by his doctor that he have bad news and that robert have cancer his response be to say go to normandy what do you mean bad news every day be bonus robert once say in our excellent local magazine all about horsham have return to europe and stand in the middle of cemetery fill with hundred of soldier and ask myself the question why they not we that be question to which these cemetery should always give rise because it remind we of our obligation to remember to be thankful and to try to be worthy of the sacrifice make pay tribute to the chair of the defence committee the right hon member for horsham sir jeremy quin for the speech that he have just make agree with every word he say and think he put it incredibly eloquently thank the government for find time for this debate and thank the defence secretary who be obviously very busy man for open the debate this afternoon have the enormous privilege of represent parliament on the commission along with the right hon member for ludlow philip dunne whom commend he for his excellent speech note that early we have in the chamber one of the previous representative on the commonwealth war graves commission my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones although he be not in his place at the moment know that he be incredibly well respected and still play an important role on the commonwealth war graves foundation which be the charitable arm of the commission be very keen to talk about the outstanding work that the commission do and the dedicated people around the world who work on our behalf on commemoration every day as we know this debate be all the more timely as we approach the anniversary of the day landing and with the commission legacy of liberation campaign we have already hear that the commission be establish by royal charter in it be global organisation care for war graf and memorial at location in country and territory include some of the most war tear area of the world gaza at the moment unfortunately as well as libya somalia and many other place the defence secretary be the chair of the commission and among the other commissioner be the high commissioner from canada australia india new zealand and south africa they all help to oversee and importantly fund the organisation and think everyone be grateful for the funding settlement agree in recent month by all the member government would also like to pay tribute to our current vice chair peter hudson to the director general claire horton and to the president of the commission her royal highness the princess royal the commission commemorate almost million individual ensure that commonwealth man and woman who die during the two world war be commemorate in manner befit all that they give to secure our freedom and our very survival of course this history be personal to all of we who have family serve in these campaign think back to my dad eric johnson who serve in world war two in the royal navy on hms begum my father in law victor morton who serve on hms ramillies as it shell enemy position at am on day to help make the landing possible my mother ruth johnson who work in munition factory in cheshire and my mother in law joyce morton who serve in the waaf at bentley priory in stanmore or as it be well know at that time fighter command thankfully they all survive the second world war but so many do not and that be why it be so important for their family that we commemorate all those who lose their life represent hull constituency in east yorkshire an area that historically have make great contribution to our armed force as be remind every time walk along those rank of portland stone graf and see so many from the yorkshire regiment of course hull civilian population be also on the frontline in the total war of world war two commemoration be important to to my constituent and of course to the nation when visit the runnymede air forces memorial be really move to see the name of hull own amy johnson first officer amy johnson be as we all know the first woman pilot to fly alone from britain to australia she go missing in when fly on mission over the thames estuary for the air transport auxiliary her body be never find but her name be on that memorial at runnymede have be to many of the site around the uk and europe over the year but want to say few word about visit that pay just last week while on trip to singapore with the home affairs committee in the heat of the afternoon along with other mp on the delegation visit the kranji war cemetery where the commission regional manager dennis shim and his team do exemplary work we lay wreath and remember the fallen want to pay tribute to dennis and his team because during covid there be very strict regulation about access to the cemetery and it be unfortunately in quite state when the gardener be allow back in to do their work have to say that it look absolutely wonderful last week it be real tribute to the hard work of the gardener and the commission we know that commonwealth casualty of the second world war be bury at kranji plus some from world war one and the singapore memorial at the site bear the name of commonwealth casualty who have no know grave this of course include number of the prisoner of war involve in the construction of the notorious burma thailand railway know as the death railway while our attention will be on normandy this june those who be involve in the far east campaign should of course be in our thought too kranji be just one example of the work of the commission which have global estate run by multinational and multilingual workforce of about the vast majority of whom be gardener and stonemason they be incredibly skilled man and woman the gardener meet in kranji last week come from india and bangladesh since the commission establishment we have construct war cemetery and plot erect headstone over graf and where the remain be miss inscribe the name of the dead on permanent memorial more than million burial be now commemorate at military and civil site around the world from canada belgium and france to ukraine georgia and papua new guinea the workforce look after these site with dedication and it be therefore only fitting that we look after the workforce with similar care be very relieved to hear of the safe evacuation to egypt of the team work in gaza for which again thank the defence secretary of course many other commission site face danger from current conflict around the world and we need to have the commission staff in our mind and prayer the commission work have develop in recent year as we focus on amend record search for miss name build new memorial and address historical inequality and injustice in commemoration like my hon friend the member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard pay tribute to the work of my right hon friend the member for tottenham mr lammy and professor michèle barrett who bring the commission attention to some of the way in which we have not commemorate as we should have do key principle as the chair of the defence committee say be that all who fall must be remember equally when we ask the public about the commonwealth war graves commission they will of course talk about the cemetery in northern france belgium or italy but we have an important job to do of commemorate those who fight but have not yet be properly acknowledge as part of our non commemoration work we have for example recently begin construction of memorial in cape town to honour some black south africans who fall while serve in africa in world war one and who have until now not be commemorate other part of our non commemoration work focus on west africa kenya egypt and india we also have duty to ensure that our site remain well visited so that remembrance of the war dead continue by create information centre volunteer opportunity and education programme design to engage and educate generation to come see today that the prime minister hand the torch of liberation to veteran peter kent the torch will now travel around the united kingdom before travel on to normandy in time for the day event in france the commission legacy of liberation campaign present momentous opportunity to commemorate the anniversary of pivotal world war two event with special emphasis on day and the momentous event that lay the foundation for free europe the commission aim to create renew emphasis on the act of commemoration and the important work of bridge the past and present ensure that the story of those who fall be pass on to young generation the public can also access interactive tour online of the commission key cemetery feature story from those in the battle detail of commission event and much more this debate take place in war graves week an annual event in may to draw attention to the commission work the commission be organise event and tour in over location across country worldwide and hope that member will get involve in those in their constituency just like the work of the royal british legion and help for heroes the commission work continue all year round every year that be why encourage member across the house and of course the new members sit on these benches within the next six month to take an interest in the upkeep and the incredible history of the war graf in their constituency they will find so many valuable lesson for the future and much to be proud of in late june and early july the ally in north africa be prepare to invade sicily which would be the first piece of territory in europe to be take back from nazi germany in battalion the cheshire regiment in the infantry division there be two good friend lieutenant david cox an oxbridge graduate age and peter martin then captain command company one morning david tell peter that he have terrible and very vivid dream in which he learn that he be go to die in place call catania he have never hear of it and neither have peter peter reassure david that it be just dream and he should think no more about it shortly thereafter the cheshires receive their order for operation husky the invasion of sicily to his absolute horror david learn that an objective of the infantry division be place call catania the very same name that he have dream about it shock he to the core and of course he become seriously worried that he be go to die there in early july the cheshires land at jig green beach just south of syracuse in sicily the landing go well and not too much resistance be encounter david be of course petrify by the premonition and peter repeatedly try to reassure he that it be just dream about week later the cheshires take part in take catania and after some hard fighting in which both officer play considerable part the town be capture with the town take by the ally peter say to david that his worry have be unjustified and he should stop fret naturally david be massively relieved the next day august the battalion be task with move through minefield david be the only officer with mine clear experience and he lead the effort to make path through it tragically mine explode as he be do so and he be kill how flip awful that story come from my mentor whom meet in when too join the cheshires by then peter be major general and colonel of the regiment hold he in huge regard and he guide as very young officer peter never forget david and visit his grave in sicily whenever he could the word of the reverend geoffrey studdert kennedy woodbine willie who win the military cross in the first world war hold true there be many kind of sorrow in this world of love and hate but there be no sterner sorrow than soldier for his mate have use those word myself david story inspire to do the same and visit his grave and have be there several time in the last few year have photograph with but be not allow to show it interruption okay will show it mr deputy speaker here it be david grave be in the catania commonwealth war cemetery which contain burial from the second world war of they unidentified it be in beautiful location will let right hon and hon member glance at the photo with mount etna behind it steam away an active volcano it be fabulous location the cemetery like most cwgc location abroad make anyone that visit it feel humble and fill with awe nothing can bring back the man bury there but at least their memory be honour properly that might be of some solace to the family and friend of those who rest there however be slightly concerned about one aspect of the work of the cwgc what appear to happen sometimes in our country for instance in south east london hither green cemetery contain over war graf the graf that be locate together more than be look after but there be many more individual graf such as that of private terence adam who be kill at ballykelly in northern ireland on december be the incident commander when soldier as well as six civilian be murder by the irish national liberation army terence grave be on its own but it be look after by my friend and former army colleague george szwejkowski who also personally care for over other graf in that cemetery he be one of many more civilian volunteer to do that as my right hon friend the member for ludlow philip dunne say george be accredit to the cwgc and tend those graf for no money simply because he feel that the poor devil who lie underground there deserve to be hugely respect be afraid that have see quite few individual war graf in the uk that suffer from lack of care know that solve that problem be difficult for the cwgc because its resource be finite it do its good and there be no easy solution it be not the fault of the cwgc but wish there be way for all graf of service personnel wherever they be to be keep to the normal excellent standard that the cwgc set in summary pay huge tribute to the commonwealth war graves commission thank our two colleague who be commissioner the cwgc do its good to ensure that those of we who live today be remind of those normally very young man and sometimes young woman who lose everything before they have really start their adult life those people do huge service for we we be here because of they thank the commonwealth war graves commission for look after they begin by thank the right hon member for ludlow philip dunne and my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson for their service as commissioner on the commonwealth war graves commission also wish to comment on the speech of the right hon member for beckenham bob stewart and for horsham sir jeremy quin the word that they have speak today not only honour the war dead but show special passion and commitment to those people in particular pay tribute to the right hon member for beckenham who have see sight that none of we in this place could possibly imagine want to place on record my thank to he for what he have do for our armed force and for the service and commitment that he continue to give to they shadow the right hon member for horsham for three year hear many of his speech but none be as passionate or as dignified as the one that he have just give to the house and he can be truly proud of those people that he speak about today in debate such as this often feel full of regret my grandfather have be dead now for year he serve in the second world war for the scottish highlanders never get to sit down and ask he why welshman from the south wales valley find himself in the scottish highlanders during the second world war but like so many other people he rarely talk about his experience during the war it be interesting that we commemorate war graves week this week think of harry patch the last fight tommy who die some year ago if anybody want to read about the brutality of war they should read passage from his book the last fight tommy he describe find young lad from company who have be rip from his shoulder to his waist he be beyond human help his word be shoot but before patch could get his revolver out to put the lad out of his misery he die his last word be simply mother you can not read those word and not realise that each and every one of those graf that the commonwealth war graves commission uphold have very personal human story even though many of they would have be dead now for hundred of year the fact be that they be once somebody wife somebody husband somebody lover somebody brother and they all will have personal story people who know know that can often bore for britain about football my interest have always be in the and but over the past year have be very draw to the football battalion also know as the middlesex regiment and the middlesex regiment which recruit footballer and supporter to fight in world war one where they fight in the somme and passchendaele there be story of people such as walter tull the very first black man ever to command company in the british army he join the middlesex regiment but be invalid out for what we know today as post traumatic stress disorder he go back he be commission as an officer for middlesex regiment he die at the battle of the somme on march at the end of the war his body be never recover even though his fellow goalkeeper from leicester fosse tom billingham try to save he he could not find his body he be believe to be bury in the somme somewhere his name be commemorate with the other at the memorial in northern france also want to talk about two friend richard mcfadden and william jonas they grow up together in scotland they be as close as brother and be both striker with clapton orient mcfadden end up company sergeant when they be together in trench under heavy shell fire jonas jump out and say good luck to my love and my wife mary jane and hand something to mcfadden when mcfadden open his hand he find locket that jonas want he to give to his wife mcfadden then write letter back to clapton orient to tell they of their loss by the time that letter be receive mcfadden have join jonas however mcfadden die in field hospital and have grave that be why it be so vital that we uphold these graf so many people who go to world war one be lie on those battlefield nameless no one know where they be but they be commemorate by their family we be now reach the very end of that world war two generation someone who be in would now be those of we who go to the remembrance service watch as they get old with their walking stick their crutch and their wheelchair and see their dwindle number but still they come they come to honour their friend and comrade still they walk but one day they will not be there hope that just as we honour harry patch when he pass away the last fight tommy of this country with people come to his funeral and the then duchess of cornwall attend we will afford the same honour to whoever that last veteran of world war two be as we see with the passing of the queen in september there be very few of that generation leave we owe they debt of honour for we would not be stand in this seat of democracy if they have not go out to fight though it be not just what they do in world war two but what they do afterwards without complaint they roll up their sleeve and rebuild this bomb damage country so that future generation could enjoy the freedom they fight for that be why it be vital that we have commitment from the government that we will remember they properly and we will mark their passing in way that be appropriate the other thing the commonwealth war graves commission do its most important work be to fight against the very real threat of fake news and the challenging of archive and document those who deny thing that be suppose to have happen in the past will challenge document but when they be face with memorial when they have to stand at those graf they can not deny that those thing happen they can not deny world war one or world war two or all the other dispute we be involve with that be why the cwgc be vital as other hon member have say our armed force footprint be decline year by year young people do not have any connection any more with the armed force for example as have say my grandfather be the last military man to serve in our family and he would be over now it be vital that we ensure that school and community group be make aware of that sacrifice this have be an emotional debate but also the house at its very good we often say that and we often overuse the word courage and heroism as though they be just word we pluck from the air but as harry kane the england captain who do vital work as an ambassador for the royal british legion say when talk about the football battalion one day you be just play football and the next you be risk your life that bring home what those people go through want to end with harry patch who find an inspiration he say he be guide by the simple word of moses thou shalt not kill when he be face with german he could not bring himself to kill that person so he shoot he in the shoulder it be vital that we remember the horror of war that we pay tribute to those who go and fight for our armed service and finally that we as government do something to honour they so that we can all join together in an act of remembrance have to say in my year of history in this parliament be hear some of the fine speech have ever hear absolutely superb until now mr deputy speaker however wholly agree with you we have have an afternoon of most magnificent speech one of the most notable feature of they all be that they have bring to life the whole act of remembrance not by grand gesture or huge strategic consideration but by reference to very particular detail family member local people constituency event and story from the day of our great war the hon member for islwyn chris evans and my right hon friend the member for beckenham bob stewart who be symbolically now sit together both give the most magnificent speech they be able to do so because they know those fact thank to the huge work of the commonwealth war graves commission rather than try to emulate the wonderfully move speech that we have hear want to contemplate for moment what we be try to do in this work through the commonwealth war graves commission and the royal british legion and in our constituency on remembrance sunday it be absolutely right and proper that we pay due respect and honour to those who have give their life for king and country attend nearly all of the repatriation through wootton bassett the people of the town stop on occasion to pay their respect to those dead body as they come down the high street and be glad that the name of the town be change to royal wootton bassett as result however the people of the town be not make any kind of political comment in do so they be not say that they support the war in afghanistan and iraq that we be go through at the time they be not say that they believe the government or the army be do good job they be pay their respect to individual who have give their life under order it seem to then that when we look at the wonder of the commonwealth war graves commission cemeterie across france and elsewhere around the world and indeed here in the uk it be not about the people who have tragically die who will not benefit from the magnificence of the cemetery there be three reason the cemetery be so superb one be to remind we we who be leave of the awfulness of war we need to realise as we see the ten of thousand of body lay out in front of we that that be the meaning of warfare and that we must do all we can to stop and avoid it in future it be memorial to remind we all that warfare be terrible thing secondly it be terribly important that we say to our serve soldier sailor and air people that if they pay the ultimate sacrifice and die in service they will be properly remember for those who do what no normal citizen would be ask to do close with and seek to kill the king enemy it be important to know that if the bad happen they will be properly commemorate and their family and friend will be able to visit their grave and know what they do that be second good reason why the cwgc work be so very important the third reason which be mention moment ago be that family otherwise have nothing to latch on to see many of they in royal wootton basset the family have nothing leave very often as in the first and second world war they do not even have body leave have beautiful stone design by lutyens baker and other lay out in wonderful cemetery with superb flower my right hon friend the member for ludlow philip dunne make good point about the flower and plant that the cwgc specialise in give the family focus so many family in this country spend time go out to where their love one fall it give they focus for their grief and to remember their fall relation and friend for those three reason the cemetery be very important it be not just about the work of the cwgc as will touch on briefly be very proud of the fact that we have welcome to the house on large number of occasion return brigade from both iraq and afghanistan it be important that we do that and pay tribute to those who give service to our armed service but also that we remember those who have not come home with they some of the most poignant moment in those welcome home ceremony over the year have be when the boy and girl in the parade remember those they have leave behind that be one of the most important thing about those occasion be very glad that we be establish parliamentary remembrance stone at the national arboretum not far from your constituency mr deputy speaker it be very important that we should do that and be glad that mr speaker initiative be now be take forward and will shortly become reality my right hon friend the member for horsham sir jeremy quin refer to the plaque around the wall in the chamber my own predecessor captain cazalet who be kill in in the sikorski crash in gibraltar be commemorate above the door behind the speaker chair it be terribly important that we have that commemoration not necessarily for the people who be commemorate but so those who be leave know that the same thing would happen for we if we be in that position these thing be terribly important and it be right that we commemorate people in that way if we believe that it be our sacred duty to remember and pay tribute to those who have die and to think about the sacrifice they make and the awfulness of war the way we do that be through the wonderful work of the commonwealth war graves commission many of the speaker this afternoon have speak about the very large number of graf and graveyard around the world include those in the united kingdom will not repeat what those member have say but all my life whether it be in belgium in the falklands or elsewhere around the world have be deeply move by see those graveyard every time go into one can hardly contain myself they be so magnificent absolutely adore the commonwealth war graves commission cemetery it be terribly important that we honour our war dead so well fear that other nation do not do so in the same way be sometimes particularly disappointed for example by the argentinian graveyard in the falklands which could do with some more work our be simply superb they be just magnificent and be therefore very glad to have the opportunity this afternoon to salute the work of the commonwealth war graves commission which do magnificent job in commemorate our war dead my right hon friend the member for beckenham be the chairman of the all party parliamentary group for battlefield and commonwealth war graf he do great work and commend he for the battlefield tour that he have lead over the year the most important moment of all those tour be when we visit the commonwealth war graves commission and hope my right hon friend will carry on that work in future great love hath no man than this that he lie down his life for his friend therefore salute the work of the commonwealth war graves commission which commemorate that fact as you have say mr deputy speaker it be great honour to speak in this afternoon debate and we be certainly hear some great contribution from member be very proud to be able to take part in this debate the work of the commonwealth war graves commission be very important to many people it may not be an issue that constituent write to we about but the value of the commission work particularly to the ability of our constituent to visit war graf be underestimate as have be say the commonwealth war graves commission be global organisation that take responsibility for the commemoration of more than million casualty in over location in different country in travel out of the libyan desert northward along the coast road to alexandria in egypt and myself and the only other brit in our expedition insist that we stop at el alamein to visit the cemetery there the other in our delegation could not understand why we insist on do so and be amazed at our persistence in demand that we do there commonwealth soldier be inter at what be an incredible location row upon row of stone alongside immaculate garden and great credit to the commonwealth war graves commission however there be also commonwealth war graves commission graf in this country as regular visitor to churchyard across the uk it interest to discover sign at the entrance that state that those churchyard contain ground of commonwealth war graf and always search out their location in the hendon cemetery and crematorium there be commonwealth burial from the first world war and from the second world war those whose graf be not mark by headstone be name on two screen wall memorial close to the cross of sacrifice there be an additional casualty from the second world war name on those screen wall who be cremate in the adjoining crematorium and there be two non commonwealth service burial and one non world war burial in the care of the commonwealth war graves commission significant reason why support the commonwealth war graves commission be that it provide memorial not only to the dead but for the living that point be make by my hon friend the member for north wiltshire james gray lose any relative be difficult but to do so in conflict when it be sudden and usually violent be particularly hard my great uncle be kill in the first world war in action at upper oosthoek farm near ypres on february his regiment the battalion east surrey be pass through the ruin of the farm building when heavy rifle and machine gun fire be direct at they and several man be hit have recently return from service in india the replacement soldier be ill equip for the wind and rain that be fall to compound their tragedy the attack be at significant disadvantage in that my great uncle and his comrade be order to advance without fire as the trench on both flank be hold by british troop and owe to shortage of ammunition there be no artillery support however the advance continue without hesitation although several officer and man fall rapidly the distance from the farm building to the objective trench be about yard hedgerow run north and south afford some cover for the first yard but the last yard lie over an open turnip field with deep clay soil while struggle knee deep in the mud across the field company be practically wipe out and company my great uncle section which be follow in close support fare little well of the whole attack party be kill and wound while five officer be kill and six wounded it be an honour today to be able to put on record the sacrifice that my great uncle make because he have no known grave and his relative have never have an opportunity to commemorate he however he be include on the role of honour at chertsey war memorial as offord jd joseph dick and on panel at the menin gate in belgium he be just year of age only know this information about my uncle and the attack from the work undertake by my cousin mark offord in research our share genealogy and raise this as evidence of the importance of the commonwealth war graves commission it be most appropriate for the legacy of liberation campaign to commemorate the anniversary of pivotal world war two event with special emphasis on day this debate today be particularly poignant as watch the lighting of the torch at the horse guards parade with peter kent veteran of day be also aware of the lighting their legacy event on hms belfast early today which be attend by my right hon friend the member for ludlow philip dunne and presume by the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson conclude by thank both of they for their work as commissioner of the commonwealth war graves commission this be role that member undertake and when people say that members of parliament be only in it for themselves we should highlight that such work be conduct in very quiet and dignified fashion without fuss and fanfare on behalf of my great uncle joseph dick offord and everyone who pay the ultimate sacrifice say thank you to the commissioner and every single employee and volunteer at the commonwealth war graves commission it be an honour to follow my hon friend the member for hendon dr offord who make very powerful speech there have be so many powerful and emotive speech and so many member have eloquently and articulately set out why the work of the commonwealth war graves commission be so important as other right hon and hon member have say it be great honour to speak in this debate refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as reservist be very proud to represent colchester which be the home of air assault brigade it be long time garrison town and now garrison city think the first garrison in colchester be form shortly after the roman invasion in ad and it have be garrison ever since but it have be very important garrison since the napoleonic war as an important garrison town we have large military cemetery in colchester it contain commonwealth war graf from the second world war and war graf from the first world war on remembrance sunday we have very well attend service at the war memorial which thousand of colcestrians attend in fact every year the crowd get large but few be aware of the two service hold beforehand at both the first world war and second world war memorial in colchester cemetery very close to the military cemetery it be colchester cemetery that will speak about this afternoon in this war graves week debate those of we on the glide path out of politic tend to look back at our time in this place as parliamentarian and the change and the difference we have try to make with that in mind would like to pay tribute to constituent of mine who have be honour to support on my election to this house in be approach by mike jackson specifically about colchester cemetery mike and sue jackson be two of the most inspirational people have ever meet they have raise over for help for heroes in memory of their late son in law kevin or kev fortuna they initially set out to raise and they just do not stop colour serjeant kev fortuna of company battalion the rifles be tragically kill in may on active duty in afghanistan mike have be raise the issue of war graf with my predecessor sir bob russell and on my election mike ask to come with he to visit colchester cemetery and of course accept he show the part of the cemetery with the first and second world war graf which be beautifully maintain by the commonwealth war graves commission he then show the war graf of those who have tragically lose their life after the end of the second world war which of course include the grave of colour serjeant fortuna shamefully despite the good effort of several family member who live locally the war graf be not maintain to anywhere near the standard of those of the commonwealth war graves commission after research mike and identify this be not colchester unique issue it be national issue mike and agree to work together to address this and campaign for change write to and secure meeting with earl howe of the other place then defence minister he explain that the remit of the commonwealth war graves commission be the first and second world war graf and any war grave thereafter be maintain by the ministry of defence he explain that the mod budget for war grave maintenance be around third of that of the commonwealth war graves commission and as sympathetic as he be he suggest speak with the chancellor of the exchequer so we secure meeting with the chancellor of the exchequer who be george osborne at the time and recall it vividly any parliamentary colleague who have ever go to ask the chancellor or any treasury minister for money know that be no easy task especially for an mp in their first year the default response be usually at least it start with no however to his great credit this meeting with george osborne be very different we set out the fact we explain the background we speak about mike jackson campaign and how wrong it be that kev fortuna family be maintain his grave not to mention the graf of those who have fall without love one nearby to tend to their graf to george osborne credit he put out his hand to stop mid sentence and say that be right leave it with but assure you go to fix it and just handful of week later at the spending review and autumn statement george osborne announce the government would fund the brilliant commonwealth war graves commission so it could tend over graf of those who have die fighting for our country since the second world war that in effect mean million as an initial up front sum and then fund as commitment in perpetuity for all war graf to be maintain by the commonwealth war graves commission pay tribute to george osborne for see this injustice and put it right and want to thank and pay tribute to mike jackson for his determination to right this injustice his campaign have benefit not just colchester but more than location where there be war graf finally but by no mean least want to pay tribute to the commonwealth war graves commission for the incredible work it do locally nationally and internationally of course welcome the uplift in funding announce by the secretary of state commemoration matter recognise sacrifice matter we must and we will remember they mr deputy speaker completely agree with your word early that this have be an astonishingly eloquent debate not least the speech of my hon friend the member for colchester will quince who have just contribute it be therefore privilege and an honour to participate in it be very proud to have brookwood military cemetery in my constituency of woking it be own by the commonwealth war graves commission and it be the large commonwealth war cemetery in the united kingdom cover approximately acre in an area of land in brookwood cemetery or the london necropolis as it be know then be set aside for the burial of man and woman of the force of the commonwealth and americans who have die many from battle wound in the london district this site be far extend to accommodate the commonwealth casualty of the second world war there be large royal air force section in the south east corner of the cemetery which also contain the graf of czechoslovakian and american airman who serve with the royal air force the air force shelter nearby house the register of those bury in the section plot in the west corner of the cemetery contain approximately canadian graf of the second world war include those of man who die of wound follow the dieppe raid in august the canadian record building which be gift of the canadian government in house reception room for visitor in addition to the commonwealth plot the cemetery also contain french polish czechoslovakian belgian and italian section and number of war graf of other nationality all care for by the commission the elegant and impose american military cemetery be the responsibility of the american battle monuments commission it be maintain every bit as carefully and meticulously as the rest of brookwood military cemetery the cemetery now contain commonwealth burial of the first world war and of the second world war of the second world war burial five be unidentified three be member of the raf and two be member of the royal canadian air force the war graf of other nationality in the commission care number include unidentified french as an agency service on behalf of the royal hospital chelsea the commission also maintain plot for the graf of the chelsea pensioner situate adjacent to the military cemetery it also maintain small plot contain the graf of member of the nursing service in the adjoining brookwood cemetery which be also in the commission care the brookwood to memorial stand at the southern end of the canadian section of the cemetery it commemorate man and woman of the land force of the commonwealth who die during the second world war and have no know grave the circumstance of their death be such that they could not appropriately be commemorate in any of the campaign memorial in the various theatre of war they die in the campaign in norway in or in the various raid on enemy occupy territory in europe such as dieppe and saint nazaire other be special agent who die as prisoner or while work with ally underground movement some die at sea in hospital ship and troop transport in water not associate with the major campaign few be kill in fly accident or in aerial combat some of the story about the life service and death of these man and woman particularly those of the special agent be truly remarkable fascinating and incredibly move fine new brookwood to memorial be build during my time as woking mp in it commemorate casualty who die in the united kingdom during the first world war but for whom no graf could be find most of the historical information that have share with the house come directly from the commonwealth war graves commission which do an amazing job what that can not convey be the beauty the terrible beauty almost of brookwood military cemetery whether it be in the snow in wintertime or rain or the glorious sunshine that have come out for many of the event that take place during the summer month it be an incredibly beautiful and move place of all the event service commemoration and concert that attend enjoy most of all the open day where the commission invite the public to come and see the cemetery the commitment and professionalism of the stone mason and gardener and explain the work that it do the right hon member for beckenham bob stewart and other mention how the commission help to track down military graf outside our major cemetery if it can not look after those graf volunteer come forward pay tribute to all of those volunteer who help out in the uk maintain graf and tell the commission when grave be not be keep properly or the stone have break it be move for to have brookwood military cemetery in my constituency we can look at those graf which be mainly of young man and woman study the first world war and for many people in our country that war those four year of terrible slaughter come out of the clear blue sky for the second world war the dark cloud be more obvious and last long man and woman of our country and allied nation around the world come forward in that hour of need and we have be pay tribute to their ultimate sacrifice have enjoy attend many of the event of my hon friend the member for north wiltshire james gray who have chair the all party parliamentary group for the armed force for so many year it be interesting to hear the story of our top armed force general admiral chief and so forth from the inside they be in no doubt that if the call come not just our generation by and large those of we in the house be too old to serve but the current generation would step up in that hour of need we have dark cloud overhead in the world the prime minister speak eloquently about that in his major speech the other day together with most colleague in the house certainly those on the government benches welcome his commitment to that target for our armed force go forward know that we have patriotic party across the house but we need to be ready the old axiom that to preserve the peace we need to prepare for the eventuality of war be the message that be come to we from our military cemetery know that this generation would make that sacrifice but the government and the house need to be on their mettle to meet the threat of the world today begin by declare an interest as former commissioner of the commonwealth war graves commission and current trustee of the commonwealth war graves foundation the hon member for woking mr lord just describe what we all see when we visit commonwealth war grave cemetery with the beauty and the neatness of their line always find it move to read the inscription and see the young age of some of the individual who take huge responsibility to protect the freedom that we take for grant today it do an extraordinary job of maintain those graf not just in this country but around the world pay tribute to all the staff include the current director general claire horton also pay tribute to his royal highness the duke of kent who have be the president of the commonwealth war graves commission since when be commissioner he take very active interest commissioner today will know his interest and he still attend ceremony on behalf of the commission even at his advanced year have the honour in be appoint by the queen as one of the two parliamentary commissioner for the commonwealth war graves commission along with my great friend keith simpson who be no long in the house like the commissioner today we both take the role very seriously it be one of the highlight of my parliamentary career and privilege to serve in that organisation also have the honour of be minister in the ministry of defence responsible for the new war grave cemetery create at fromelles in that show that we be still find casualty throughout the world who be still give the respectful burial that each deserve pay tribute to the staff who do the research and for all their care and dedication fromelles be on different scale more than body be uncover in piece of detective work by an australian individual it be great honour to attend the interment of the first casualty there along with my australian counterpart it have be say that we think the commonwealth war graves commission be great british institution but like lot of thing in the uk it come into be by accident the tenacity of fabian ware great registration scheme in the first world war lead to the formation of the commonwealth war graves commission be it universally popular at the time no it be not suggest that anyone with an interest in how it come to be read the debate of may when the money be be apportion to set it up follow the great war be it foregone conclusion no it be not people argue against it such as the member for holborn sir james remnant who argue that the dead be not the property of the state it be quite new thing then for the state to take the decision because in other campaign body be repatriate if people could afford it one individual in that debate oppose what he call the nationalisation of death the commission be set up uniquely by dedicated individual at an italian war cemetery the general graf be huge mausoleum and the private be stick behind the commonwealth war graves commission be clear that in death everyone be equal that be an important message and be why the standard commemoration be put in place no exception be make one of the most poignant thing for be not the graf themselves but the name of individual general can be next to private there be no rank in death an example that sum that up well be down at the hollybrook memorial in southampton which commemorate those lose at sea there be lord kitchener and then long list of name of those from the south african labour corp who be lose in an accident off the isle of wight that show what the commission do and continue to do to ensure that individual be remember regardless of their status when be commissioner have the great honour of visit the commission staff around the world include as think the secretary of state mention in gaza it be not the easy part of the world but the dedication of the staff be just the same will certainly be think of they today and the job that they do the cemetery be beautiful the most poignant one that visit be in papua new guinea it be in the middle of jungle but be beautifully maintain by the staff as the right hon member for ludlow philip dunne say the staff look after not just the memorial and the gravestone but the horticulture be bit of an anorak on the subject but if anyone want to look at the horticulture of the commonwealth war graves commission its history be absolutely fascinating the work of gertrude jekyll and other set the standard that be maintain today as the right hon gentleman say with climate change adaptation need to be make and the commission be at the forefront of that work have the honour of be trustee of the commonwealth war graves foundation the problem with the commission if there be one be that its remit be very tightly control by its royal charter when be on the commission one of the issue be whether technically we be able to do education it do not fall within the remit so we come up with the idea of the foundation encourage everyone to look at the foundation website and ask those who be not already member of the foundation to join so as to support its educational work it be great at take the work of remembrance and of the commission to school and so on that work be not just about remember the commission iconic site in france but about get people to recognise what they have on their doorstep that form the subject of project that work on when be commissioner there be war graf in our local cemetery in my constituency there be number of single graf but also in stanley cemetery and in sacriston cemetery the commonwealth war graves foundation be try to ensure that people be aware of their local history because the people in those cemetarie be mainly local people when we look into the story which some great local group be do we find that the reason why graf be in particular place can be very interesting in county durham there be the graf of an australian bomber crew who be kill return from training mission think someone refer to this site early when discuss the commission work with its international partner but in cannock chase there be some casualty from australia and new zealand alongside nearly german casualty zeppelin crew and so on who die mainly during the first world war that show that the commission work internationally why be there australian and new zealand casualty in cannock chase of all place well it be very sad story it be casualty clearing station and the casualty go there after the first world war have survive the horror of the western front only to die in most case of spanish flu casualty turn up in different place for interesting reason we in the commonwealth war graves foundation be keen to work with local group we have volunteer who not only maintain graf but work on history project it be important to get school involve we also have lecture programme people can ask for lecture from volunteer and be one be qualified to give the commonwealth war graves foundation lecture to local group encourage everyone to look at our website and try to get their community involve they will be amazed to see what be on their doorstep that be an important way of bring not just the work of the commission but local history to life have sit here quietly so far and almost hesitate to intervene because this be very dignified debate but the right hon member be make an extremely important point in my home town of tain way up in the highland we have war graf and many be the graf of czech airman which reflect exactly the point that the right hon member make for year two people billy and mary grant have look after those graf out of the goodness of their heart have mention they deliberately want they to have their name in hansard because of all the good that they have do the right hon member point be excellently make and support it to the hilt thank those volunteer but the hon gentleman have raise another interesting point these be not just british casualty throughout the united kingdom there be casualty from all nation that contribute to our effort in both world war as have say be passionate about this subject think the two commissioner in the house will confirm that once you have be commissioner you have it in your blood know be pain when go to funeral or wedding because always go around the cemetery to see whether there be any commonwealth war graves commission site the commission have take great step forward in digitise information and give visibility to the casualty who be bury not in large cemetery but on our doorstep let end by pay tribute not only to the commission current staff member but to those who have go before they be loyal dedicated individual be this about glorify war no it be not it be about recognise the sacrifice that people make and let we hope that we can continue to do that it be poignant especially give the war that be take place in europe to recognise the sacrifice that be make on our behalf

propose that this house do now bell it be pleasure to speak on behalf of my constituent in this debate on crime in birmingham edgbaston be pleased that have be able to secure it as it come on the back of spate of issue that constituent have raise with in the past number of year which appear to be get bad in the west midland neighbourhood crime have be steadily rise since although the title of this debate cover birmingham edgbaston know that the experience and challenge that we face in my constituency be feel across birmingham and the whole of england my constituency cover the ward of edgbaston north edgbaston harborne quinton and bartley green let start by focus on an issue that have be an absolute stain on the life of so many of my constituent in recent year the rise in car relate crime as the minister will no doubt be aware this be one of the many area of crime where outcome have steadily worsen over the past year by when labour last leave office vehicle theft in england and wales have drop to third of what they be year previously in the year since number have rise again by third to over but while theft have rise the number of case solve have not home office datum for the outcome of report crime show that only of car theft record lead to suspect be charge or summon in total this figure amount to total of of car theft be not solve last year however what really want to talk about today be not the headline statistic as bleak as they be but some of the real story behind the statistic because debate about crime be not abstract the experience of my constituent can not be describe by line on chart the result of crime be often life shatter confidence shake and trail of devastation in its wake with the victim force to pick up the piece recurrent issue that be cause misery for many resident be car strip in one of my constituent have her toyota aygo strip at parking bay in her residence in matter of day her replacement car be once again strip on that occasion another car on the same compound be strip at the same time my constituent neighbour be witness to the latter incident and call the police as she watch someone pick apart the car in real time but be apparently tell by the police that they be far too busy as my constituent put it be on state pension and live alone this have cause financial problem but more than that it have leave emotionally and mentally exhausted feel if be to buy or borrow car that the same would happen the police have great opportunity to catch the criminal and at least send message to other receive another similar case from member of street watch group in harborne constituent have their car target time in one year and swap to another car as their toyota yaris be uninsurable their new car be strip in less than week constituent from the same area contact to say that resident on their road have see one of these incident take place in broad daylight she immediately ring the police but despite inform they that she be witness the incident happen before her eye and despite there be police station around the corner she be tell simply to log the incident online the impact that these crime have on people life should not be understate want to share the story of another of my constituent who work within the nhs at the queen elizabeth hospital birmingham in my constituency she say last thursday afternoon on my return to my vehicle after long day in clinic discover that my new car of only month have be steal although my insurance be fully comprehensive be not entitle to courtesy car as it have not be involve in smash or be vandalise and fund to cover the cost of the vehicle will not be pay out until at least day have pass in case the car be recover as you can imagine be devastate and this will impact my working day as well as my life outside massively in our department alone small team of we have personally experience break in steal belonging vandalism damage steal catalytic converter from my previous car month ago and now vehicle theft we have all be witness to multiple case of car cannibalism to the car of other qehb staff too the only member of the team who have be directly affect be those who arrive very early and as result be able to obtain on site parking there have also be multiple case of car theft and vandalism amongst the wide department staff we can see that these be not just isolate incident but pattern of worsen more frequent and more brazen crime for the victim such as those hospital worker it be devastating it turn ordinary people live upside down and take they away from otherwise contribute to society whether through work in the nhs look after their family or support their community however particularly when so many crime go unresponded to and unsolved crime also have poisonous impact on our society as whole because it shake our confidence in the very people and institution we be mean to trust to keep we safe take katy who also find her car strip she say report to the police for reason that might be resource relate have be inconsequential and thief seem to know that give their increase audacity and frequency of such incident this be simply call for help since my neighbour and myself be grow increasingly hopeless all these thing contribute to grow sense of despair that nothing in this country work any more burglary be another increase issue it be bad enough to have one car strip or steal but it be uniquely disturbing to know that stranger have break into and steal from one own home there be unique sense of violation and fear that many victim share with when they find they have be burgle one constituent who contact tell my wife be home when miscreant break into the house and since then we do feel safe in our own home during this week as many as more burglary have take place no house which be lock even for few hour during the day be safe police official come and do the formality of paper work and rest we do know in quinton we have face spate of burglary even as family be at home eat dinner and during the day resident say they have notice how much more brazen criminal have become they do not care if one person be in or even if whole family be at home that have leave resident terrify in their own home almost all of they have ring doorbell but they do not seem to deter the culprit the point be make be that the fear that crime put into victim last so much long than the time take to experience and report the crime as we can hear in these testimony there be sense that in this country certain form of crime simply happen without any consequence that feed sense of isolation hopelessness and powerlessness that be corrosive to the society that we surely want to create that be why apply for the debate and be raise these story in the hope that the minister can give my constituent some reassurance that the government be take the matter seriously and that the perpetrator of these crime will see justice on car cannibalism especially we know that part be often steal to order and pass on for the valuable material they contain minister have suggest previously that they would consider review of the scrap metal dealers act if necessary will the minister consider it what additional funding have the government make available to tackle illegal unlicensed operator in the metal recycling sector and launch wide campaign to tackle that crime appreciate that he may mention the national police chiefs council metal crime steering group but what action have be implement as result of that group recommendation and how be the outcome measure the national crime agency have refer to an overall increase in organise acquisitive crime include car theft that be evident in the shocking rise in car theft in the most recent year accord to the home office own statistic why do the minister think his government have fail to prevent serious organise crime group from take hold across britain town and high street concern that my constituent raise frequently be that they do not feel that police be adequately resource to handle the crime that they report and have to deal with and what be more that the reassure community police presence need to deter criminal in the first place be not there give that police community support officer have be cut since and only of officer be assign to neighbourhood policing team my constituent have point do they over the past year the government have oversee litany of broken promise on police across england the decision to cut experienced police officer before try to replace they with vastly less experienced officer be just one of catalogue of error that have have lasting impact on people trust in the police have hear colleague talk about the glory day when they have five or six police officer and police community support officer in every ward while be have to fight to get number increase meanwhile the number of arrest have halve prosecution have almost halve and the number of crime solve have halve more crime be be report but few crime be be solve criminal be get away with it on this government watch those figure be accompany by cut to youth service and other institution that be set up to support young people and reduce the cause of crime in our community after year of tory austerity youth service in birmingham have be starve of the resource they desperately need the total core budget for youth service last year be just million and there be currently just full time equivalent youth worker provide service to around teen across the city one youth worker for every teen young people in my constituency deserve well they should have the same opportunity to develop and thrive as every other child across the country that be why the next labour government will launch young futures new national cross government programme aim at give britain young people the good start to life specific strand of activity will be target at the young people most at risk of be draw into violent crime and will deliver support for young people struggle with their mental health in my patch the high number serious violent offence have become persistent problem everyone have the right to feel safe and secure in their community but heartbreakingly many of my constituent do not in our city be shake to its core by the murder of year old dea john reid his attacker chase after he in car yell racist slur at he and then hunt he down child like pack of animal dea john death be horrify he be much love young boy with so much ahead of he to lose he in such

cannabis farm and the road always seem to smell of cannabis there be serious assault in the early hour saturday morning with the offender reside in the hmo there be vulnerable adult reside at the bottom of the road where the local drug dealer use his property as hang out there be similar story across edgbaston bartley green harborne and north edgbaston my constituent also say know in other area the police assist with cctv or mobile camera to assist with catch offender can this not be an option for my constituent road in plea to catch local offender and make resident feel safe again that be direct plea from my constituent despite the repeat call from family across birmingham edgbaston and throughout the country criminal be not be catch or pay the price some of crime be go unsolved and million crime include shocking of burglary be drop with no suspect be identify that be the shameful tory legacy on criminal justice we simply can not afford to carry on like this labour have make really important pledge to get neighbourhood police back into community with extra police officer and pcso to guarantee patrol in our town centre and to tackle knife crime as part of our mission to halve serious violence put on record my thank to my local police officer for everything they do with the limited resource they have be also grateful to our new chief constable who have agree to prioritise neighbourhood policing but the west midland have have police officer cut and we be still short fundamentally people do not feel safe and do not feel that they get justice as victim of crime on this government watch congratulate the hon member for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill on secure this evening debate let start by provide some national context before answer some of her question she mention number of crime figure in her speech and it be important to put on record that two set of crime statistic be publish there be police record crime which be the figure she be quote and then there be the crime survey for england and wales produce by the office for national statistics the police record crime figure depend on the propensity of the public to report and how good job the police do in record those crime over the last five or seven year the police have become lot well at record all the crime report to they and that be why those number have go up however the office for national statistics tell we that the most reliable set of figure for long term crime trend be not the police report crime figure for the reason have set out they depend on the public propensity to report and the police ability to record they but the crime survey let give the hon lady some of the crime survey figure since which she mention as reference period on like for like basis all crime have come down by since accord to the independent office for national statistics while violence be down by theft by domestic burglary by and vehicle theft by there be lot more to do particularly on shoplifting vehicle crime and knife crime which will come to in moment but the overall crime trend be down on resource which the hon lady mention few time across england and wales as whole we now have record number of police officer on march last year we reach police officer that be more than we have ever have before and it surpass the previous peak which be in march by about officer so we have record police number and those have broadly speak be maintain since that record be reach in march last year on west midlands police specifically its budget this year be million which be an increase of million year on year or about high than the current rate of inflation think many of the question the hon lady be ask be question she should be address to simon foster the police and crime commissioner for the west midlands who somehow manage to get re elect couple of week ago because he have those financial resource whereas other police area around the country have hit record number as have the total that have not happen in the west midlands that be question would strongly encourage she to ask mr foster now that he have somehow get himself re elect the hon lady ask several question about specific crime type she go through quite long list so will quickly go through some of the more important of they she mention for example knife crime which be concern the number of people get admit to hospital with an injury by knife have come down by in the last five year but there be furth to go london be conspicuously much bad than the rest of the country in the rest of the country lot more progress be be make but there be an exception in london we be do quite lot to combat this first we be encourage great use of stop and search do respectfully of course that take knife off the street and we would welcome cross party support for the police to lawfully use stop and search more to get dangerous knife off the street secondly we be invest in various form of technology in fact just this lunch time be with company an american company that be develop new technology that can scan somebody walk down street to see whether they be carry knife and it can distinguish knife from mobile phone or something else it be not quite ready to deploy yet but think it will be ready to deploy experimentally this year think that could revolutionise our ability to look at crowd and detect who in that crowd be carry knife and then make sure they be stop the knife be take off they and they be arrest we be also do quite lot of work on prevention and the hon lady mention youth service notoriously birmingham city council go bankrupt but the home office be directly fund violence reduction unit to the tune of more than million year across the country which be design to work with young people whether it be with mentoring work experience cognitive behavioural therapy or youth activity sometimes in partnership with football club to help get they on to well path the youth endowment fund do lot of work here it have million and commend the work of jon yates the chief executive from next year there be go to be million increase in violence reduction unit fund over three year which be about increase because as the hon lady say support those young people be so important this autumn we will also be pilot with the youth endowment fund new initiative to try to identify the or so of young people or early teenager who be most at risk of get into serious violence and serious crime that include look at range of indicator such as mental health education housing or have an old sibling who be involve in gang indicator that go beyond criminal justice so that intervention can be make to stop vulnerable or at risk or year old become violent or year old that initiative have the potential to make real difference the hon lady talk about car crime and crime more widely which be concern recently meet the chief executive of jaguar land rover to discuss exactly this point we be step up work on car crime and be work with the national police chiefs council lead assistant chief constable jenny sims of the merseyside force steal car be often sell and rapidly export in container to country include the united arab emirates and the democratic republic of the congo we will do more work to stop that export at the border we will also increase the amount of intelligence work do so that we can spot pattern and identify the organise criminal gang who be often steal these car the testimony that share be so powerful because they be people experience of be victim of crime those people say that give that the west midlands police be still police officer short the resource be just not there so they be give crime reference number and that be it that do not make people feel safe the minister be talk about youth crime and various initiative but youth service have be decimate there be nowhere for young people to go and there be no opportunity for good job or training so they get exploit those be the kind of thing that young people need they need hope and aspiration youth unemployment be of course great deal low today than it be under the last labour government on resource and police number in the west midland as mention the police and crime commissioner in the west midland have million more this year than last year so the hon lady ought to ask he ideally publicly what he be spend that money on and why he be not address the issue that she raise agree that car crime and other crime affect the victim terribly that be why police across the whole country include of course in the west midland have commit to always follow reasonable line of inquiry where they exist include in relation to car crime big technological change that we be already exploit be retrospective facial recognition if the victim have an image of an offender ring doorbell image mobile phone photograph of someone take car close circuit television footage from shop where shoplifting have occur even if the image be blur or partially obscure it can be run through the police national database for match the facial recognition algorithm be now extremely accurate that be way in which we be already catch lot more criminal include some involve in car crime encourage victim who have picture of suspect to please give it to the police because they have commit to always not sometimes run it through the facial recognition database and they have commit to always again not sometimes follow up reasonable line of inquiry where they exist that be for all crime even crime that some people would historically have consider minor that commitment be make last september and it be vital that the police deliver on it and support victim for the reason the hon lady set out will the minister give an example of where that technology have be use because have never know that to happen when resident send image that seem to be blur the police be very clear that they can not do anything with they can the minister tell how many force be use the technology and when there have be conviction wonder how much long have but the technology be be use across the whole country this year over order to answer the minister question he have until pm which be some minute away how long his speech take be of course matter for his discretion be put no pressure on he be tempt to use all minute and be sure the hon lady have intervention that would take up fair chunk of that but will be lot briefer which be sure will be popular with colleague retrospective facial recognition be be use thousand of time every month and there be all kind of example of it be use successfully for example murder be commit in coventry nightclub couple of year ago and the only piece of evidence be photograph of the suspect take in the nightclub run that through the police national database get match and the police go to the suspect address and find the suspect there with clothe cover in the victim blood and he have now be convict there be hundred of example just from the past few month of retrospective facial recognition be use photo that be blur or dark can often be match obviously there need to be some sort of image that the police can look at but it be remarkable to see the image that can now be match use that algorithm strongly encourage everybody to send image to the police if the police do not run they through the facial recognition database people should ask why and push the police to do so because they have commit to do that we now deploy live facial recognition in way that allow suspect who be wander around high street or train station to be identify and arrest have also mention technology such as knife scanning facial recognition have the potential in the come year and month this be not long way off it be be use now to transform how we catch criminal so that we do well job for victim the hon lady also ask about scrap metal interestingly enough have meeting today with the all party parliamentary group on metal stone and heritage crime chair by my hon friend the member for south west bedfordshire andrew selous lord birt who be member of the appg from the lords also attend we discuss what more we can do scrap metal theft be estimate at about million year when the scrap metal dealers act be pass in it be private member bill from my predecessor sir richard ottaway the figure be about million year so the value have come down by more than third since but we would like to go far the hon lady mention the npcc group on metal theft it be my intention to invite myself to that group and attend its next meeting which think be on june to press for more action in this area the theft of catalytic converter and lead be the area of most pressing concern the hon lady briefly mention shoplifting which be matter of extreme concern the police have national retail crime action plan which include plan to target prolific shoplifter and to follow reasonable line of inquiry include by always run the picture from cctv through the facial recognition database the government publish our additional action plan just couple of week ago which include plan to meet the call from member of this house the union of shop distributive and allied workers and other to create stand alone offence of assault retail worker that have be widely welcome madam deputy speaker you will be relieve to hear that be not take up all minute have set out the action that be be take and more importantly the result that be be deliver there be some disappointing trend in the west midland but know the hon lady will take those up with the police and crime commissioner simon foster and will ask he what he be do with the million extra he have get this year will work constructively with she and other colleague to make sure that our community be keep safe question put and agree to house adjourn
