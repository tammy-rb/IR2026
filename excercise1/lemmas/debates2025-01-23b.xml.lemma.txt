constituency who be deeply concerned about the trade barrier put up by the previous government that be damage growth in the north east may urge my right hon friend in the strong possible term to prioritise pragmatism in our relation with the eu and to ensure that business in my part of the country can get the support they need and export the good they manufacture my hon friend raise good point of course we set out in our manifesto that we would not return to the single market to the custom union or to freedom of movement within that framework we absolutely take pragmatic approach put the national interest first to tear down trade barrier wherever we can the end of this month will mark the anniversary of brexit will the minister assure that we will not return to the appalling division of the past and do he agree that the forthcoming summit and reset negotiation be vital opportunity to discuss growth not just for the diverse community and business in my constituency but for our nation my hon friend be absolutely right this be time to look to the future not to go back to the division of the past the forthcoming eu uk summit present significant opportunity to make people in the uk and the eu more secure safe and more prosperous for more than year the european union have be in breach of its international treaty obligation to join the european convention on human right what be the government do to address the arrogance of the european union on that issue would say first that the government be commit to our membership of the european convention on human right and secondly that the hon gentleman talk about body and organisation not be compliant with international treaty but one of the big problem with the previous government be how they sign international treaty and then seek to condemn they when they themselves have put pen to paper maroš šefčovič be today dangle the prospect of the uk join the pan euro mediterranean convention of course the quiet part be that that would once again turn this country into rule taker not rule maker ahead of the summit can the paymaster general rule out the prospect of the uk fall in line with so call dynamic alignment in other word take eu rule and regulation and will we instead strike out in the world and do new deal with america and around the pacific rim do not accept the binary choice that the hon gentleman present we want to increase trade and export all around the world that be hugely important as the prime minister say we do not choose between ally we look to deepen all our relationship of course we welcome the positive and constructive tone from commissioner šefčovič we be always look for way to reduce barrier to trade but within our manifesto red line because we take pragmatic view on where the national interest lie we do not currently have any plan to join pem and we will not provide running commentary on every comment that be make call the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster yesterday in davos mr šefčovič suggest that the uk and the eu be talk about dynamic alignment as the paymaster general will be aware that is if true very significant step will he be clear with the house be dynamic alignment on the table have to give the hon gentleman top mark for audacity do not know whether conservative mp have hear but week ago the leader of the opposition give her new year speech and as be sure they know we listen to it extremely carefully do they know what she say about previous eu uk negotiation she say that the conservative government be engage in they before we have plan for growth outside the eu these mistake be make because we tell people what they want to hear first and then try to work it out later why do the order think we be in be not go to sit down minister interruption thank you we have lot of question to get through if you want to make statement on that in future would welcome it would welcome that too mr speaker because the right hon gentleman be not answer my question just as he do not answer the question of my hon friend the member for dumfries and galloway john cooper and just as his department be not answer question of any hue at the moment as my hon friend the member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood make clear it come to something when mr šefčovič be well guide to what be go on than the british government if the government be commit to dynamic alignment that be significant step as the right hon gentleman will know because it could bring the european court of justice back into have jurisdiction over the united kingdom so for the avoidance of doubt will he rule out the ecj have jurisdiction over the uk in any regard in the future be astonish by the question because the hon gentleman be also the shadow northern ireland secretary and will know the role that the european court of justice play in the windsor framework turn to his question about the negotiation we have set out our red line in the manifesto and have set out example of thing that we be seek to negotiate that be already there the leader of the opposition be apologise last week for the conduct of the conservative party in its relationship with the eu why be the hon gentleman not start with an apology or do he just not get the memo from his leader call the liberal democrat spokesperson the wholly inadequate deal with the eu negotiate by the previous conservative government have do enormous damage to british business which have see soar import cost increase workforce shortage and ream of red tape create huge barrier to growth the return of trump administration in washington change the landscape of trade deal globally with the threat of high tariff and will be deeply worry for many business across the country the uk must lead on the world stage again stand up for our interest by work closely with other country most importantly our european neighbour as set out by my right hon friend the leader of the liberal democrats in his new year speech last week urge the minister to be more ambitious in rebuild our relationship with europe do he agree that the good way to boost growth and fix our relationship with the eu be to agree new uk eu custom union be grateful to the liberal democrat spokesperson for her question but as indicate in an early answer we do not choose between ally we be look to deepen our trade link right around the world with different partner but the hon lady should be aware that we be ambitious on the uk eu relationship and we will take that ambition forward into the uk eu summit

have lose her seat at the general election that former shadow leader of the house be one of new labour peer wait to be appoint by the prime minister to sit in the house of lords could the minister explain how the labour party stuff the house of lords with its crony be any less of an affront to democracy than when the tories do it do not think the hon gentleman can seriously compare the

bring forward new national procurement policy statement that will put sme right at the heart of government procurement policy open end to end procurement datum could be goldmine for mission drive

transparency and openness at the heart of our strategy include new online portal which will make it much easy to see upcoming bid agricultural and business property reliefs obr costing urgent question to ask the chancellor of the exchequer what assessment she have make of the office for budget responsibility supplementary forecast information release on the costing of change to agricultural and business property relief at the autumn budget we take difficult decision on tax welfare and spending that be necessary to restore economic stability fix the public finance and support public service we have to do that to address the mess we inherit from the previous government which the right hon member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins will remember well have serve in that ill fated government we have take these decision in way that make the tax system fair and more sustainable the government be well target agricultural property relief and business property relief to make they fair these reform mean that despite the tough fiscal context the government be maintain very significant level of relief from inheritance tax beyond what be available to other under the current system the benefit of the relief on business and agricultural asset be heavily skewed towards the wealthy estate accord to the late datum from his majesty revenue and customs of agricultural property relief benefit the top of estate make claim that be just estate claim million of relief it be similar picture for business property relief with more than of it be claim by just of estate make claim which equate to estate claim million in tax relief our reform mean that individual can access relief for the first million of combined business and agricultural asset and thereafter give the nil rate band this mean that couple can pass on up to million between they to direct descendant inheritance tax free yesterday the office for budget responsibility publish further detail on the data source and modelling use to estimate costing across number of the tax measure announce at budget include the reform to agricultural property relief and business property relief the costing be the same as publish at budget and the approach to model the costing be typical and in line with other tax policy as the government have set out the reform mean that almost three quarter of estate claim apr in include those that also claim bpr will not pay more inheritance tax this be fair approach that protect farm while also fix the public service we all rely on call the shadow secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs have inherit the fast grow economy in the the chancellor budget have lead to the high borrowing cost since the pandemic growth flatlining business confidence plummeting and job freeze who have labour choose to pay the price for its economic illiteracy pensioner family business and farmer for month farmer farming business professional adviser and economist and now eight major supermarket have warn the chancellor that she have get her figure wrong but minister cleave desperately to their soundbite let we hope that they listen to the obr yesterday the independent obr release additional information about this particular measure and reiterate the high uncertainty of the predict yield it note that the yield of the measure be likely to be reduce by because of behavioural response and that it be unlikely to reach steady state for year the obr also express grave concern about the impact on old individual and their ability to plan in short the reassurance provide by minister be fall almost as flat as the economy the chief secretary to the treasury have lecture this house about the peril of sideline the obr in light of its analysis will the minister now commit to full and proper review of this dreadful policy the public have notice that government ministers be fail to answer reasonable question about their policy so will the minister please give straight answer to the farmer and business watch our proceeding today in light of the new analysis how many farm do the treasury think will be affect by the change to apr apr bpr and bpr alone what assessment have he make of the central association of agricultural valuers find that the chancellor have underestimate the number of farm affect by the change by factor of five how many tenant farmer will be evict as worrying report of suicide among farmer begin to emerge will the minister please do what the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs have fail to do and measure the number of suicide over the next month so that we can understand the human cost of this policy finally why do the minister think that tesco sainsbury asda morrisons marks spencer aldi lidl and the co op have all come out against this tax policy and believe the treasury figure to be wrong why do he think they be wrong and he be right think there may be some confusion on the conservative benches about what the obr data show the datum publish by the obr yesterday refer to exactly the same costing as be publish at budget it set out the approach to modelling and the costing which be typical and in line with other tax policy indeed the obr statement make it clear that the obr role be to provide independent scrutiny and certification of whether the government policy costing be reasonable and central that be exactly what the obr have do in publish the extra information which show the modelling behind the datum that be publish at the time of the budget the shadow secretary of state ask about the datum the datum on the number of affected estate claim apr and indeed apr bpr some be the upper estimate be in table of the obr document publish yesterday that be consistent with what we have be say for many month since the budget think opposition members be confuse the value of farm with the value of claim under inheritance tax the only way to truly understand the impact of change to inheritance tax policy on inheritance tax claim be to look at the claim datum itself we be work in partnership with the large supermarket chain to make sure they be drive economic growth we be very clear that some of the decision we have to take in the budget be difficult decision that will have consequence but we be determined to work with business across the country to drive economic growth which be the no mission of this government the people of newcastle upon tyne central and west love the local produce provide by local farmer in our fantastic market such as grainger market and they enjoy the beautiful countryside of northumberland which have be shape by generation of sustainable farming however we can not help but be aware that most of that land be own by for example the duke of northumberland big landowner and those seek to minimise their tax exposure so do the minister agree that by keep this loophole open for so long the country have push up land price and push out the next generation of young farmer there certainly be evidence that the current inheritance tax system have cause people to use these relief for tax planning and to avoid inheritance tax bill my hon friend allude to the broad question of the fairness and sustainability of this measure as mention early of agricultural property relief benefit the top of estate and of business property relief benefit the top of estate the leader of the opposition have say that she think this be good way to prioritise public money but we think it be neither fair nor sustainable call the liberal democrat spokesperson after year of the tories fail our rural community include with dodgy and utterly shameful australian trade deal it be great pity that the new government have pick up the baton from orkney to the isles of scilly liberal democrat colleague be extremely concerned about the impact of these proposal the report publish yesterday clearly demonstrate the uncertainty about the income from the misguided family farm tax over the next two decade in the light of this and give that it will hit old farmer in particular and those who put food on the table of the united kingdom will the minister do the right thing and scrap this tax the obr document publish yesterday refer to the level of uncertainty associate with this policy which be exactly what be set out at the time of the budget and it be typical way in which the obr respond to new measure what be publish yesterday simply reiterate the obr conclusion from the end of october do my hon friend agree that once again the conservative party have fail to agree with the tough decision we have make and have no idea how to raise the revenue to finance the public service that benefit rural community like mine in north buckinghamshire my hon friend be absolutely right the party opposite in fact the party opposite routinely support the government spending and investment decision but will not support any of the difficult decision we have to take to fund they the weight of public and business opinion be not with the minister on this issue and the body of expert opinion speak out against this tax proposal be now overwhelming the minister be kindly man so wonder if he will indulge what would he be say if he be in opposition and that weight of opinion be be express against conservative government treasury policy the hon gentleman be kindly man too value the conversation that he and have have outside the chamber people look at this policy and all our policy in the budget will recognise that we have to take difficult decision and will understand the context our inheritance from the previous government we recognise the toughness of those decision they be not easy to make but we prioritise balance the public finance and economic stability because that be how we get investment in growth which our country so badly need rise mr dickson think you be very late would not want to embarrass you by allow you to ask question one of the witness before the environment food and rural affairs committee tell we that the government change hit the people the government say they be protect and protect the people the government say they be hit it be difficult to improve on that analysis of what be propose it really do not have to be like that there be sensible debate to be have about reform inheritance tax to stop the super rich from shelter their wealth while still protect family farm his majesty revenue and customs have its technical consultation come up why do the minister not agree to broaden its term engage with the farming community and look for way to protect family farm and get at those who be shelter their wealth in land the policy that we be implement include generous provision to protect family farm the million entire relief from inheritance tax for agriculture and business property asset that be in addition to the nil rate band that people can access as part of the general inheritance tax scheme we think that strike the right balance between make sure we raise money for the public finance and protect family farm mr speaker have you notice pattern that on thursday treasury minister will be ask to come to the commons to answer an urgent question and there will be barely soul on the labour benches behind they when they do order surely that be not relevant to the question you be go to ask come on the office for budget responsibility forecast that the measure will raise million in revenue by which in the context of tax revenue of over billion be very small number what value do the minister put on food security for the united kingdom obviously the government put the high priority on food security that be why our policy set out to support it and the farming sector more widely the policy be one of many difficult decision that we have to take in the budget to balance the public finance support public service and provide the economic stability we need for investment and growth have hear from many farming business across glastonbury and somerton over the last few month but one farm in hurcot near somerton recently write to to describe the anguish and stress that the change to the apr and bpr have cause they as in the case of many farming business their succession planning have focus on the primary landowner retain the farm until death how will the minister explain to they that accord to the obr the potential loss of their family farm business be likely to have little impact on the public finance and that the policy will hit the old farmer hard the obr publication yesterday set out the costing that be in the october budget there be no difference between the costing set out in october and what the obr set out yesterday it simply show more of the background behind how they calculate those costing for transparency and so that people be aware indeed it say in the report that that be do in an effort to improve the public debate and ensure that people understand what be behind the datum publish at the time of the budget as say to several opposition members clearly this be one of many tough decision that we take in the budget to balance the public finance but we also make sure that there be great protection from inheritance tax under our propose reform scheme than be available more widely the labour government family farm tax will be catastrophic to farmer in my constituency in the borders will join many of they and their tractor in kelso on saturday when the farming community come together to show its displeasure and disapproval of this policy farmer will struggle to pay this tax so what assessment have the government make of the policy impact on vet feed merchant machinery supplier and all the other people who support the rural economy support the rural economy public service and investment right across the country be part of labour national mission to get the economy grow but the prerequisite for that investment and economic growth be stable public finance without economic stability we can not proceed to the investment and growth that we all so desperately need that be why the decision to target agricultural property relief and business property relief be take alongside all the other difficult decision that we take in the budget this measure be now reveal to be spectacularly ill consider leave aside the fact that it be also breathtake betrayal of farmer who be promise before the election that this would not happen the measure group intergenerational farmer with speculative millionaire seek to dodge tax by get involve in farming it have put an immediate brake on investment in farming which threaten to low yield and drive up food price that then threaten to put inflationary pressure on the uk economy which be already in perilous state this government can not just agree with the obr when it suit they they must agree with the obr regardless of what it say will the minister please respectfully pause the measure take some time to think about this and come up with something that will actually deliver for the treasury but not push our family farming sector under there still seem to be confusion among opposition members about what the obr publication set out it reiterate the costing that be publish at the time of the budget on october it explain how those costing be arrive at so that people can understand the calculation behind they but the costing be the same as those publish at the time of the budget mr speaker if you look at the register of members financial interests you will see reference to my family farm in my constituency last sunday drive one of our tractor to fakenham racecourse to support the farmer protest against the apr and bpr talk to other farmer and the key complaint be that there have be no consultation on the change and no time for old farmer to adjust their affair all those concern have be rubbish by ministers time and again most recently today now that the obr confirm that it be more difficult for old people to restructure their affair quickly will the government finally listen show some humility and consult on how good to tackle the tax shelterer while still protect our farmer the comment in the obr publication yesterday about old individual reference point that have be make since the budget in debate in this place and elsewhere we have point out that our reform of agricultural property relief and business property relief maintain generous exemption from inheritance tax million be subject to relief and there be the relief beyond that the exist nil rate band and other exemption in the system unusually in scotland tenant farm can be pass down as inheritance have be ask the treasury whether it have make an assessment of the impact on such farm give that their farmer can not sell land to meet the apr liability that they might face so far the answer appear to be that there be no assessment so ask the minister for an answer from the dispatch box be he aware of agricultural tenancy under the agricultural holdings scotland act and have he make an impact assessment the way to calculate the impact of change to inheritance tax policy be to look at the inheritance tax claim that have be make and that be what we have use as the basis for our calculation in fact the obr publication yesterday confirm that it use hmrc data on inheritance tax relief in the past and inheritance tax project forward and it be on the basis of that datum that we design our policy the minister have just confirm that the treasury modelling be base on agricultural property relief and joint agricultural and business property relief claim yet tax expert have say in evidence to the environment food and rural affairs committee that many family farm will wrap their agricultural land into single business property relief claim so the treasury modelling do not take into account family farm that have use bpr only claim tenant farmer who use bpr and the many rural family business that will also use bpr will the minister please take this opportunity to look at this again before his government wreck the countryside as set out early the need to reform business property relief be as strong as the need to reform agricultural property relief in order to have stable public finance and fair and sustainable tax system as set out of apr go to the top of estate and of bpr go to the top of estate give the fiscal context that we inherit that kind of unfairness be not sustainable when balance the book we need to develop the tax system in way that be sustainable and give we the economic stability that we desperately need after the mess that the previous government leave we farmer have make their inheritance tax plan in good faith base on exist rule in effect the measure be retrospective change to tax law so will the minister agree to at the very least delay its implementation until the effect be properly understand by both farmer and the government the government be commit to deliver the reform announce in the budget we have carefully consider their impact and design the policy to provide generous exemption from inheritance tax for small family farm and business while ensure that we balance the public finance as fairly as possible in the light of the uncertainty in the obr report the fact that the policy will hit elderly farmer the hard and put food security at risk and the fact that rural community will suffer the most give the impact on tenant and young farmer and the wide agricultural sector do the minister really still believe in this policy the obr allusion yesterday to degree of uncertainty be exactly the same as what it say at the time of the budget the costing be exactly the same as what it publish at the time of the budget yesterday the obr publish more information about how the costing be arrive at but the cost itself the degree of uncertainty and the calculation remain exactly the same as at the time of the budget the minister just mention balance the public finance those be the key word through these measure we have just have the debt figure for december which be high than the obr expect they to be just two month previously at what point will the minister and the government recognise that they have get this badly wrong and change course we recognise that when the conservative party be in government it get it badly wrong the country decide to change course which be why they elect we into government to fix the public finance put our public service back on their foot boost investment and get the economy grow they say that one ought to build one enemy golden bridge think the compromise and pause propose by the national farmers union be an elegant solution that golden bridge be now be signpost by tesco aldi lidl the co op and all the major retailer the minister claim to be engage with why do he not just pause go back listen and review the policy as set out in answer to previous question the government be commit to deliver the reform announce in the budget they be carefully calibrate to retain generous inheritance tax exemption while ensure that we balance the public finance as fairly as possible bence builders merchants in my constituency have be provide good local produce and good local job since the earl of aberdeen be in power the owner paul bence fear that the combination of business property relief change and change to employer national insurance mean that there be huge disincentive to invest far do the minister share my constituent concern thank the hon gentleman for raise his constituent concern do not know the specific of the case but more broadly investment decision depend above all else on stable economy and stable public finance without the hard work that we have do since take office to fix the public finance and bring back economic stability investment would be hamper and our growth ambition would not materialise in the way that we be determined to ensure happen there will be rally on saturday and the minister appear to imagine that this indicate acclamation for his policy we hear early in the week from the hon member for falkirk euan stainbank and today from the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central and west chi onwurah both well know rural area that this be all about the land estate and wealthy people but can assure the minister that the farmer will speak with in castle douglas on saturday be tenant farmer and family farmer and they face be put off the land after generation be he really suggest that should tell they they have nothing to worry about be not go to tell the hon gentleman what he should say to his constituent but what can tell he about the government policy be that we have reserve generous inheritance tax relief for people in the situation he describe encourage anyone who be concerned to seek advice to understand exactly how the new rule might apply to they sometimes be absolutely flummoxed we probably all be by the chancellor intent to tax work family farm which we all know will result in the loss of small farm the sale of the land and reduction in food security now it seem that the obr agree that it will not make saving will the minister commit to meet cabinet colleague urgently to remove the sword of damocles that be hang above small family farm and hurt the agrifood sector as whole say to the minister that there be way forward increase the threshold from million to million and family farm will be save thank the hon gentleman for his question but think it be base primary on the obr publication yesterday reiterate the point have make several time now that obr publication reiterate the costing and figure set out at the budget it reiterate the level of uncertainty associate with the measure as publish at the budget it provide more detail behind that but the conclusion be the same as it be on october on point of order mr speaker before question the minister should have remind the house of my entry in the register of members financial interests my failure to do so for which apologise be inadvertent just get carry away with the excitement of the moment thank you for that wonderful clarification attorney general office conflict of interest urgent question to ask the solicitor general if she will make statement on the management of conflict of interest in the attorney general office the attorney general office have an established and rigorous process for identify and deal with conflict and potential conflict that arise from the law officer past practice that process predate the appointment of the attorney general and sit against the backdrop of every lawyer professional obligation to be alert to and to actively manage any situation that might give rise to potential or actual conflict learn member of this house will keenly appreciate the importance that all lawyer place on that obligation in identify conflict or potential conflict the attorney general office adopt cautious and beyond reproach threshold to any conflict or potential conflict my department work with the government legal department the foreign commonwealth and development office which oversee international litigation on behalf of the government the crown prosecution service and the serious fraud office to revise and augment the list of conflict identify once the conflict have be ascertain and set of action identify for each conflict the attorney general office take step to ensure that the law officer be appropriately limited in their involvement on matter relate to the relevant area of government policy or related litigation the list be keep under review and amend for example when new government policy or litigation emerge in situation where one law officer be conflict another law officer be ask to act in their place the law officer convention be an important principle enshrine in erskine may and the ministerial code and uphold by successive administration that preserve the ability of government to receive full and frank legal advice from their legal adviser in confidence be therefore unable to comment on the specific detail of legal advice provide by the law officer other than to note that of course decision on policy be take by the relevant secretary of state as have be the case under successive government that process sit alongside the system relate to ministerial interest oversee by the prime minister independent adviser on ministerial standard who be provide with the attorney general list of conflict follow his appointment can reassure the house that the attorney general office will continue to apply the most rigorous standard in its conflict process call the shadow solicitor general thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker the attorney general previously represent former sinn féin leader gerry adams in damage claim bring by victim of ira bombing indeed we know that he receive for that representation the constitutional propriety of our legal system demand absolute clarity on how conflict of interest with former client be manage at the very high level of government this go far beyond individual matter of advice it strike at the very heart of the proper administration of justice let be absolutely clear that this be not about lord hermer career at the bar it be about the proper mechanism for recusal when matter concern former client come before government the house must know what safeguard be in place to protect the public interest when such situation arise especially regard section and of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act what be the formal procedure for the attorney general recusal in matter involve former client have the attorney general recuse himself from any matter since take office what assessment have be make of potential conflict arise from his extensive litigation against the government interruption this all go to the heart of public confidence in our legal system the prime minister stand at the dispatch box and promise this house government of standard and integrity interruption the proper management of conflict of interest at the high level of the government legal service be not optional it be fundamental to that promise order please you have two minute not three and we have to stick to the rule allow you to go on but be not cough for my health it be to give you hint to come to the end of your question have you now finish have mr speaker thank you call the solicitor general have outline the rigorous process that exist in the attorney general office and have exist across administration of all colour the house may be aware that the shadow justice secretary the right hon member for newark robert jenrick have write to the cabinet secretary seek clarity the clarity to which the shadow solicitor general refer on that process and an investigation into it the cabinet secretary have today confirm by reply that the attorney general office have rigorous system in place to ensure that law officer would not be consult on any matter that could give rise to potential conflict of interest he have restate that those arrangement be of long standing and part of standard practice that have apply under successive administration interruption encourage opposition members to take comfort from that order interruption solicitor general when be stand you must sit down mr mullan whether here or elsewhere do not want running commentary from you on everything we debate do we understand each other indicate assent good because have certainly have enough of it thank you mr speaker the shadow solicitor general raise the previous experience of the attorney general lord hermer be very experienced barrister and during his time in private practice prior to his appointment to government he represent high profile client in number of case it be central and well understand aspect of the british legal system as she know that barrister be require to accept instruction if they be available and qualified to do so the well know cab rank principle she will also be very aware that put simply barrister be not their client as the bar council state barrister do not choose their client nor do they associate themselves with their client opinion or behaviour by virtue of represent they in recent day the opposition have cynically link the attorney general with some of his previous client grow up on military basis in armed force community in the and remember what it feel like when my dad have to check underneath the car before every single journey we make note that because it be the backdrop against which say that would defend with every fibre of my be the duty of any barrister in this country include lord hermer to defend any client before any court as we all should will end by restate the principle in word that think be particularly powerful do judge surgeon by their patient journalist by their interviewee or lawyer by their client those be the word of the current conservative shadow attorney general call the chair of the justice committee do the solicitor general agree that what the shadow solicitor general be ask she to do in not very subtle way be to breach the law officer convention by the back door if the attorney general be to reveal whether or not he be able to advise on particular issue that would reveal the fact that he have be ask to advise on it the opposition intention be clear it be to gain party advantage the effect be to undermine the rule of law very much agree with my hon friend be happy to confirm that where the attorney general have conflict he will recuse himself call the liberal democrat spokesperson the shambolic conservative government create crisis for democracy in this country with their cronyism rule break and constant sleaze scandal they even appoint as their attorney general the right hon and learn member for torridge and tavistock sir geoffrey cox who before his appointment represent some of the world large tax dodger the liberal democrats want to repair the damage that be do by the constant stream of conservative sleaze and finally restore public trust in our politic do however have some question for the solicitor general have the attorney general seek independent legal advice regard any possible conflict of interest relate to his previous work at matrix chambers can the solicitor general assure the house that all and any impropriety will be thoroughly look into and will she please introduce annual training on conflict of interest and ethic for all ministers and finally enshrine the ministerial code in law order the hon gentleman have mention another member do not think it be critical and that be fine but if it be member it be just let finish if it be critical be sure that he will have inform that other member do you do there we go and members be get all excited call the solicitor general be grateful to the hon member for his question have outline the rigorous process that exist in the attorney general office and as say have exist across administration of all colour declare an interest as member of the justice select committee do my hon friend agree that the opposition position fundamentally misunderstand the role of lawyer in our justice system the attorney general also represent victim of the tragedy in grenfell tower do my hon friend also agree that the attorney general have follow the same process as his predecessor in manage any potential conflict and that what we be face with be just another example of the opposition try to undermine our legal institution merely for political gain very much agree with my hon friend the undermining of this foundational principle of our legal system have be extremely cynical section and of the legacy act enjoy unanimous support in both this house and the other place it be the government choice to repeal those section that have raise the question before we today and open up the possibility of compensate gerry adams be it do not agree be afraid do the attorney general experience have serve both as distinguished advocate and now as law officer not make he uniquely qualified to uphold the rule of law and advise the government appropriately be grateful to my hon friend for her question and it will be no surprise to hear that very much agree with she lord hermer be an extraordinarily experienced barrister and he bring that experience to his role as attorney general understand that the solicitor general want to maintain the confidentiality of the law officer office but the issue before we be whether there be conflict of interest for example the attorney general have advocate in relation to the policy of the israeli government and then we have have change of policy by the government that have be directly influence by the legal advice that have be give the challenge be whether that advice have be give on the basis of prejudicial view hold prior to enter the attorney general office do not expect the solicitor general to unveil the detail but she must understand that that be the impression be give every aspect of transparency and democracy require that the advice give by the attorney general to the government be impartial correct and not prejudiced the hon member will know that the law officer convention mean that can not confirm that the attorney general have advise or whether his advice have be seek on any matter we be see some extraordinary and absolutely shameless attack because not only be the attorney general barrister of international standing but as my hon friend the member for wolverhampton west warinder juss say he represent the victim of grenfell tower do the solicitor general agree with that conservative members would do well to remember that when they attack the attorney general about his former client be grateful to my hon friend for her question and agree with she call jim shannon interruption oh sorry mr speaker be so used to be call last laughter my humblest apology my motivation be clearly justice for the innocent victim that be what be about at the heart of this urgent question be gerry adams when this house put in place pension for innocent victim of the trouble and at that time exclude perpetrator from apply gerry adams and his colleague seek to block those pension adams hand be dripping with innocent blood not least from when he be the commander of the la mon bombing which kill and maim my constituent will the attorney general recuse himself from all matter relate to adams and will this government ensure that adams do not get one single penny as have already state the law officer convention do not permit to reveal when the attorney general have be ask for advice or when he have advise draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as member of the bar it seem that conservative members be deliberately feign ignorance about our constitution to make an empty political point the truth be that lawyer in this country represent client without fear or favour we do not in this country associate the view of our client or the client with the view of their lawyer and there be the concept of the cab rank rule do the solicitor general agree with that the law officer convention and exist process which as she say have be in place for many year under successive government can be leave to regulate conflict of interest as they always have do if the conservative genuinely have problem with that they would have change it when they be in government agree with my hon friend and be grateful to he for make that point as say early barrister be quite simply not their client and have quote the word of the current conservative shadow attorney general the current attorney general have track record of take up multiple case against the british government give his previous work with regard to both gerry adams and the family of those make claim against uk special force on which matter will the attorney general recuse himself from advise ministers owe to clear conflict of interest if he be not able to fulfil the full scope of his role owe to his prior career be his position even tenable be afraid could not be more clear have already say that where the attorney general have conflict he will recuse himself as someone who grow up in warrington and who be friend with tim parry who be murder by the ira subsequently have to do public affair engagement work in northern ireland so be well aware of some of the difficulty that can come from the outcome shall we say of some of the violence suffer in northern ireland do the solicitor general agree that lawyer should not be identify personally with the cause for which they be report house of lords june vol those be not my word they belong to the distinguished commercial barrister the conservative shadow attorney general do the solicitor general agree with about those word agree wholeheartedly with my hon friend under the ministerial code every minister have responsibility to address conflict of interest or perception of such an interest will the solicitor general be open with the house about whether when the attorney general be appoint he choose or be require to recuse himself from advise on issue relate to his previously represent client such as gerry adams have already address that point do the minister accept that the law officer convention do not extend to question of recusal or conflict of interest and that the house and the british people have the right to have question on those matter answer transparently have be abundantly clear on this where the attorney general have conflict he will recuse himself the law officer convention do not permit to say in relation to which matter he have recuse himself because in do so would reveal the matter that the law officer have be ask to advise on or indeed have advise on like the solicitor general also practise as solicitor she must know that the question that be be put be not call into question barrister right to represent client this be about barrister who be now the attorney general do she accept that the law officer convention be be extend in the interest of the attorney general not answer legitimate question about recusal and conflict of interest and that nobody should seek to extend that principle beyond its intention in order to remain silent do not accept that the law officer convention be be extend at all as have say could not be more clear where the attorney general have conflict he will recuse himself business of the house will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business the business for the week commence january include monday january general

monday february second reading of the public authorities fraud error and recovery bill tuesday february motion to approve the draft social security benefit up rat order and the draft guaranteed minimum pensions increase order wednesday february motion relate to the police grant and local government finance report thursday february business to be determine by the backbench business committee friday february the house will not be sit over the past few month the labour party have be generous indeed in offer the people of this country regular evidence of its remarkable incompetence but even by its formidable standard it have excel itself this week the prime minister say some time ago in term that he prefer davos to westminster but this week he have leave the global hobnobbing and après ski of the world economic forum to the chancellor of the exchequer to assist she in her relentless search for growth her late idea be to revive the third runway at heathrow project so toxic to her labour colleague that it have be brief against by the energy secretary and publicly reject by the mayor of london before it be even preannounce as so often be afraid we will have to wait for the announcement to be make in this house meanwhile the chancellor wizard wheeze of the autumn to set up new office for value for money be publicly rubbish in the most unsparing term by the chair of the treasury committee the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier who describe it as an understaffed poorly define organisation set up with vague remit and no clear plan to measure its effectiveness that be from the chancellor own labour colleague spending review be always fraught and this one will be still more so because the chancellor have box herself in so badly on taxis and spending what the government think will be achieve by couple of dozen hastily assemble newbie and some adolescent management consultant run around apart from make thing even bad be hard to imagine in case we forget mr speaker you and and everyone else in the chamber indeed every taxpayer be pay for that then we have no less figure than the director of the institute for fiscal studies weigh in he note that the government have do nothing but talk about growth ever since the last general election he then note at the same time we have see the imposition of additional employment regulation further regulation of rental housing hike in stamp duty big increase in tax on employer an inflation bust rise in the minimum wage refusal to contemplate any serious liberalisation of trade or free movement and perhaps clampdown on immigration he ask what be this government theory of growth he then answer his own question nobody know those be just three example of the government absolute lack of seriousness in economic but as we have just hear in the urgent question there be serious issue in the area of law that they can not avoid let remind the house what have happen the attorney general have be repeatedly ask whether he have or have have conflict of interest in relation to legal matter that could affect his former client gerry adams in response spokesman for the prime minister have highlight system to prevent potential conflict from arise the attorney general have cite the convention that law officer do not discuss their advice to ministers and have disclaim any connection between his work for mr adams and the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act as the solicitor general have just say the standard that they be aspire to be to be beyond reproach the problem be that none of that address whether the attorney general in fact recuse himself this do not fall either within the law officer convention or the cab rank principle he either do recuse himself or he do not the problem be make bad when one reflect that this attorney general be the first in the history of the office to have come into government directly from private practice that point be completely ignore in the urgent question and that that practice be not in one of the less political area of law such as corporate law or chancery but squarely in the highly contentious and political area of human right with some of it in northern ireland there be no reason whatever in law or ministerial practice why the attorney general should not be transparent on this issue as he have be already in relation to the legacy act there be strong public interest in he do so his legacy comment prove that he concede the point about the importance of clarity in this area in the independent adviser on ministerial standard recent letter regard the former anti corruption minister the hon member for hampstead and highgate tulip siddiq he highlight that the ministerial code say ministers must ensure that no conflict could reasonably be perceive to arise between their public duty and their private interest that conflict clearly exist now in relation to the attorney general do the leader of the house share my view that we should have debate on the standard to be apply in these complex case where there be potential conflict between the demand of the ministerial code and the statement make by the government in defence of the law officer concern be sure that the thought of the whole house and the country will again be with the family of bebe elsie and alice the two teacher the neighbour and all the child who attend the taylor swift dance class in southport after the horrific attack and murder last summer what they face be truly unimaginable this tragedy be make all the bad by the fact that it could have be prevent as the home secretary say this week the house will be aware that the government be pursue number of action in response an independent public inquiry that will leave no stone unturned an end to end review of prevent strong measure to tackle online knife sale and knife crime and quick piece of work on the limitation of the current definition of terrorism will ensure that the house be keep up to date on those and relate matter the right hon gentleman raise issue of standard in public life as gently remind he last week he may not want to draw on the record of the conservative government and compare it with our but he raise some important question which have just be answer in the urgent question as he will know the cabinet secretary reply to the shadow justice secretary that the attorney general have properly declare his interest from his previous role as senior barrister as barrister with wide range legal practice the attorney general will have represent many client accord to bar association rule barrister do not choose their client nor do they associate themselves with their client opinion or behaviour by virtue of represent they the cabinet secretary have explain that as well as the declaration process for all ministers the attorney general office have rigorous system in place to ensure that law officer would not be consult on any matter that could give rise to potential conflict of interest the right hon gentleman will know that these arrangement be long stand and have be practise in successive administration be not sure whether he be argue that we should no long have an attorney general who have be recently involve in private practice at the high level perhaps he will let we know today be actually very special day perhaps historic day because it be the last day that the former prime minister could have call general election oh how different thing could have be the conservatives would have still be on this side of the house with three time as many member as they have now the right hon gentleman would still be enjoy himself on the back benches and the house would not have the delightful presence of the hon member for clacton nigel farage and for boston and skegness richard tice instead we be six month into labour government be sure the conservatives regret call the general election early but be afraid

will know that in scotland under the scottish national party bus route have be almost halve since and local authority franchising have be delay for five year which have be fail community however as result of our budget the scottish government will receive their large settlement in real term of any time since devolution this must now be use by scotland to put in place the bus service and other service that her constituent so desperately need despite state in that it be in strong financial health labour control bradford council now want to put up council tax for my constituent by whopping this be shocking situation result from continuous mismanagement by our council leader who have splash million of pound of taxpayer money on bradford city centre project include million on music venue that be finish but not yet open despite our city of culture status all the while the council have let child service degrade to an unacceptable level despite the last conservative government step in and issue it bail out just last year may we have an urgent debate in government time on how to stop local people across keighley ilkley silsden the worth valley and my wide constituency pay the price for bradford council leader failure have to gently say to the hon gentleman that the failure be under the previous conservative government who leave local government on its knee with year of austerity move money away from area of high need such as his bradford constituency to area of low need he will know that the cost of child service have go up and up in recent year with huge rise in demand but central government fail to provide any of the funding or support that local authority need to get grip of the situation that be why we introduce our child wellbeing and schools bill bill that think he vote against the other week which will begin to address some of the chronic cost for local authority in provide child service it be also why the government be put local government finance back on an even keel and ensure that we deliver on the basis of need not of politic yesterday receive one of the good email that have receive since become member of parliament it come from my constituent gareth stewart and relate to his son hugo who have finally secure place at the royal school for the deaf in derby hugo be deafblind and it take two year for his parent to secure an education health and care

resolution come only yesterday have speak to gareth several time about his case because it be so serious he be content with raise it on the floor of the house on the condition that in his word use it to speak about the wide problem that we have in staffordshire with the special educational need and disability system too many parent face the same challenge they often use the phrase delay tactic to regard the need to go to tribunal and the consistent argument at every step of the process will the leader of the house update we on her discussion with cabinet colleague about introduce bill to fix our broken send system and will she bring forward debate on the shocking number of wrongful council decision on send support that end up be overturn at tribunal receive that email from gareth stewart

will happen often in his case he and his constituent be right to raise the chronic challenge face by our special educational need system which recent national audit office report find be at the point of crisis cost and demand be rise yet outcome continue to fall this really be broken system and the government be commit to address that as an initial step we put an extra billion into send in the

permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement about the energy company obligation and great british insulation scheme the government have identify an emerge issue of poor quality solid wall insulation instal under those two inherit scheme energy company obligation begin in april and the great british insulation scheme begin in may around household have have solid wall insulation instal under the scheme in october trustmark the independent body that oversee tradespeople work in home do routine audits and find significant example of solid wall insulation under those scheme that do not meet the requisite standard at that point trustmark begin suspend number of the installer responsible after official in our department be make aware of the issue they ask trustmark to conduct much full audit which conclude in mid december official inform ministers at the start of december about the situation and tell they that early finding suggest that there be widespread case of poor quality installation that do not meet the require standard since that point we have consult the certification body responsible for oversee the work and the building safety regulator to understand the true scale and nature of the emerge problem it become clear to that there be serious systemic issue around and gbis solid wall insulation it range from minor problem such as missing or incomplete paperwork to major problem such as expose insulation or poor ventilation which if not fix could lead to damp and mould as more poor quality work have come to light total of business have be suspend from instal new solid wall insulation in people home can inform the house that suspend installer will not be able to deliver new solid wall insulation under any government scheme until they have fulfil their obligation to put any issue right additional on site audits be be conduct as speak so that we can get full picture of the scale of the problem and identify affected household the auditing work continue at pace and we have put in place comprehensive plan for immediate repair and remediation where need let be absolutely clear about this installer must fund any repair work themselves and carry it out as soon as possible consumer should not be ask to pay penny towards the cost of get the problem fix we have instruct ofgem the energy regulator to oversee that work ofgem will work with trustmark and certification body to ensure that it be deliver at speed non compliant work find through the audits be already be fix in the very small number of case in which trustmark audits find health and safety concern include wire not be fit properly the problem be be fix urgently with the expectation that they should be resolve within hour critically reassure the house that additional monitoring and check be be put in place to ensure that future solid wall insulation be do to the requisite standard it be also important to say that base on what we know so far we believe that the issue we have discover be specific to solid wall insulation instal under and gbis strong system of check and balance be in place for other scheme that involve local authority and social housing provider so we do not expect to see the same scale of problem there however the government be review the quality of solid wall insulation under other scheme will update the house on the result of that work as soon as they be available we will continue to require the urgent remediation of any issue find across all government energy efficiency scheme know that this will be concern news for family who have have solid wall insulation fit through those scheme get this sort for those customer be our no priority since be inform of the problem have work with ofgem to develop full plan for assess all affected property and get any problem fix let set out what our plan mean for those family ofgem will now oversee quality check on all solid wall insulation instal under either scheme to identify household that might be affect that will begin with every measure be examine over the come week by qualified professional and that will include look at photographic evidence if quality check raise issue the certification body that oversee the installer or trustmark will arrange an inspection of the property and the problem will be fix as soon as possible installer will be require to provide evidence to trustmark that issue have be properly fix let reiterate our assurance that where solid wall insulation under the scheme have not be do right consumer should not have to pay penny to fix that we be clear that the responsibility for find and fix any problem lie with those who carry out the work consumer do not need to take any action now however give the inevitable concern among those who have have those measure instal all household with solid wall insulation fit under the scheme will be send letter from ofgem in the next three week it will set out the step that we be take and how household can proactively raise concern we be also set up advice page specifically for those affect the government be move fast to protect household but must be honest with the house these issue be the result of year of failure in system that must be reform home upgrade be we believe one of the good tool to get bill down for good and deliver warm home that be why our warm home plan will cut bill for million of household by upgrade their home include with solar panel battery heat pump and energy efficiency measure such as double glazing and loft insulation however the government have inherit fragmented and confusing system of protection for people who want to insulate their home too many organisation with different role and responsibility not enough clarity for consumer about who to turn to if thing go wrong and problem that should have be pick up early be miss the system be in dire need of reform installer be responsible for poor quality installation but they have be allow to operate in fail system that have leave some household expose to bad practice the system can no long command confidence which be why we be committed to overhaul it and to drive up quality and protect consumer through the warm home plan we will look at the entire landscape from how installer work in people home and be certify and monitor to where homeowner turn for rapid action and enforcement if thing go wrong and we will ensure that there be more of guide mind oversee upgrade across the system the step have set out demonstrate that the government will do whatever it take to protect consumer we will regularly report back to the house about the step be take we have set up process through which colleague from across the house can raise concern about their constituent above all we be determined to ensure that family be never let down in this way again we will put in place robust system of compliance audit and regulation so that consumer have the confidence to take up the offer of upgrade their home we will do what be necessary to ensure that family can have warm home and low bill commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of her statement and for take the time to meet this morning prior to make the statement the eco scheme and the great british insulation scheme be set up because we know that improve the energy efficiency of home be one of the good way to cut energy bill and keep people warm this be especially the case for those who be in fuel poverty when we take office in just of home in this country have an energy performance rating of to today that figure be around and for social housing we go from in to today that be record that we be proud of record of reduce bill for household and keep family warm almost half of the measure instal under gbis have be in low income household solid wall insulation be small proportion of the overall work that the eco scheme and the great british insulation scheme undertake the vast majority of installation under those scheme have be cavity wall and loft insulation alongside installation of smart thermostat and boiler upgrade under the eco scheme however it be deeply concern that example of substandard solid wall insulation have be identify in some of the installation under those scheme we of course support the action that the minister have announce today and ofgem be give responsibility for oversee the repair and remediation and it be right to conduct additional on site audits to inform action move forward thank trustmark for the work it have do to identify example of poor quality solid wall insulation and we also welcome the fact that there will be review of the quality of solid wall insulation under other scheme it be absolutely right for installer to fund the repair work and to ensure that the situation be remedied for affected household as soon as possible nobody should have to live in house with damp or mould as result of poor quality insulation could the minister in addition to take the action that she outline in her statement please answer the follow question first have the audits undertake so far identify what proportion of the solid wall insulation be affect by poor quality work can she confirm that all company that have be suspend still exist and set out the mechanism by which they will be require to remedy their work what action be be take to make sure that remedial work be of the require standard to ensure that consumer be protect from yet more poor quality work what action be the minister take to make sure that everyone who have solid wall insulation instal under the scheme be inform promptly and in full and that nobody will be miss will she publish full list of the company suspend from the scheme for carry out poor quality work and have the department consider take legal action against they member in all part of the house want to ensure that family have warm and comfortable home that be efficient and cheap to run the minister have our assurance that we will work cross party to ensure remediation for those affect thank the hon member for his response be glad that there be consensus across the house that energy efficiency measure and home upgrade be key to deliver warm home and low bill and hope all member be supportive of the action the government be take in answer to the hon member question we be still conduct audits to get full picture from sample that have be do stress that the sampling be gear towards the installer that we think be most risky it seem that significant proportion of that sample have major issue which be why we be take this action on the installer that have be suspend we be work through certification body and trustmark to require they to go into household and remediate the work in the case that we have audit that be happen the vast majority of installer want to do the right thing and want to do good job and where issue have be flag they be repair the work where we think there be problem we have mechanism in place for make sure that the installer deliver on their obligation and the guarantee system act as backstop crucial question be how we ensure both that where remediation work be be do it be be do to the right standard and that future solid wall insulation be do to well standard we be put in place additional spot check across the piece to make sure that where work have be remediate it have be do to the require standard and critically all solid wall insulation will be give more monitoring and check supplier have commit to that so that when people be have this work do they can be confident that it be be do to much well standard than we have see on keep everyone inform we will be write through ofgem to all household that have have solid wall insulation instal we will be do quality check on all solid wall insulation should stress that we hope the vast majority of those will be okay and that any issue will be minor but we want to do quality check across the piece our priority be get in make sure we be do proper inspection of the property and get key issue remediate as quickly as possible through all of that our priority be the consumer whose experience have to be as hassle free stress free and cost free as possible this should never have happen in the first place and we be determined to get this right and fix it on those consumer behalf as the minister know have long campaign in this area and be grateful to she for meet my hon friend the member for burnley oliver ryan and myself along with the ssb victim support group last year to discuss these important issue as such welcome the concrete step that the minister intend to take in this area she will know that many of the victim of the ssb law scandal be directly impact through faulty cavity wall insulation but the step that the minister have outline today be about solid wall insulation can she confirm that exactly the same action will be take when we be deal with cavity wall insulation and if not why not will she also agree to make sure that compensation be available whether through remedial work or in other way for all those impact by the cavity wall insulation scandal thank my hon friend for his avid and consistent campaigning on these issue as he know there be an ongoing investigation into the case of ssb law at the moment to answer my hon friend specific question for any insulation that be instal under government scheme we expect that the system will kick in and respond we be aware of case that have be raise with trustmark and other body and we be work to make sure those be remediate where the insulation have not be instal under government scheme we have example of that where constituent have engage with insulation scheme that be not government scheme there be different set of mechanism we be work with the system to make sure we be respond to household because as have say this be not the fault of individual household the system be not work properly we be go to prioritise government scheme because we have the lever but we recognise that there be an issue for household that have have work do outside government scheme call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of her statement can only imagine the frustration that consumer feel when they go through the quite often complicated process of try to upgrade their home to bring down their bill for good only to be meet with substandard work and subsequent lack of enforcement liberal democrat members recognise that the government have inherit fragmented and confusing system and that the focus today be on consumer and on remedial work affect the shoddy work they have have instal be glad that the government be commit to ensure that the onus of that remedial work do not land in the pocket of consumer we agree that the system need complete overhaul especially since the last conservative government leave the great british insulation scheme fall woefully short of the target it set for itself and support far too few people far too slowly while some who do receive installation have find they to be well below the require standard if fault be find with other energy efficiency measure will the minister guarantee that consumer do not have to pay penny for those as for the one she have highlight how soon can consumer expect their quality check to be deliver and will priority be give to household in fuel poverty as well as to the elderly and the vulnerable thank the hon member and be again glad to hear that she agree we need big overhaul of the system which be absolutely our focus and our commitment on other measure under eco and gbis audits be not find the same scale of systemic problem we think the problem be focus on solid wall insulation in particular we be do stress test and additional audits of other measure to make sure but we think there be specific problem with those measure so we be focus on they and move at pace to get they remediate where we be find major issue we be set expectation that that work be prioritise and installer be come in and remediate it as soon as possible under the exist publicly available specification framework remediation after installer have not put the work right have to be do within week and we be set the expectation so the system move at pace to respond to consumer we will absolutely be look to prioritise household in fuel poverty and vulnerable household we be do two thing we be contact they but we will also create the ability for people to reach out if they be worried or vulnerable so that we be do the necessary triaging and critically get into property to fix work that have not be do right sincerely thank the minister for her great work on this in the six month she have be in post she have make more progress than the last lot do in year this have be serious problem for victim in burnley so thank she be glad she be look at early scheme too because many home have fall victim to cowboy builder and fail insulation over several year look forward to her update on early scheme which need to be action by the previous government but be not and be ignore for an awful long time particularly welcome the strong regulation the clarity for consumer and the clear process for complaint which will make genuine difference have two question will the ban on particular company follow the director of those company too often we have see company be establish and put in poor insulation and then the director go away extinguish the company and start again somewhere else as my hon friend the member for bradford east imran hussain ask will this cover cavity wall insulation where it have be government back thank my hon friend for all the work he have do on this and for engage with and my department we be aware of instance where company have fold so as not to deliver on their obligation to remediate work and have then set up again we be put in place process through the certification body to mitigate that with clear expectation that company will not be take on by another certification body if they do not get the work right our priority at the moment be solid wall insulation because that be where we think there be an immediate problem with eco and gbis we be aware from member contact we of the wide issue that need to be address come back to the fact that we understand that the system have not be work for consumer quite frankly the quality and quality assurance across the system have be far too fragmented and patchy critically consumer protection have not be underscore in the way it need to be we be look to overhaul the system and we be conscious that there be issue with other scheme and be think about the good way in which we can resolve they call the father of the house refer the minister to the last word in her statement which be that the government will ensure that family have low bill there will always be problem with insulation in country with massively degraded and old housing stock which underline the vital importance of cheap energy we have have month with virtually no wind and no sun and so call green energy be produce hardly any of our energy we be import energy we be stop drilling in the north sea and we be not build gas fire power station what about old people their heating allowance have be take away and we be crucify they with ever high bill meanwhile china its annual increment in emission be more than our entire emission be go on pump out emission and drill baby trump be pump out emission why be we crucify our old people would say to the right hon gentleman that the status quo be not fit for purpose he say we should not take action yet the last government preside over the bad energy crisis we have see for generation over the past two and half year we see his model result in record energy bill the conservatives be willing and content to accept that and they think it be tenable it be not acceptable to we our view be that we have to wean ourselves off our over reliance on global fossil fuel market that be volatile and that critically will not guarantee low bill we be commit to deliver clean power yes because it deliver on our climate requirement but critically because we think that that be the route by which we will deliver home that be warm and cheap for consumer at the heart of everything we be do be ensure that consumer who rely on energy not because it be luxury good but because it be absolutely foundational have energy at stable price that they can access and afford this be not status quo we be willing to accept and that be why we be take action thank the minister for her statement and commend she for the work she have be do it must be say that we have inherit an almighty mess from the previous government which be incredibly frustrating she will know how important this issue be to my constituency which be rural with too many people on low wage we have more than our fair share of poorly insulate home and fuel poverty be therefore real concern can the minister reassure my resident and be sure many resident across the country that the news of this late setback will not delay progress on the improvement in rural community such as mine thank my hon friend and we be absolutely committed to upgrade people home we believe that that be the route to deliver warm home that be cheap to run and that commitment stand for all community we want to move at pace with our warm home plan because we want to deliver upgrade in people home however we be very clear that part of that have to be an overhaul of the system because if consumer want to go on this journey they need to be confident that the work do will be of the utmost quality and standard and that if thing go wrong we have proper redress system in place that be not what we inherit but it be absolutely what we must deliver welcome what the government be say about the need to address this issue and it will be reassure for the very many people who have raise the problem with their mp however be they also go to look at whether there be wide problem with insulation generally as have be mention and have they have discussion with the devolved administrations about scheme in the wide uk thank the hon member and yes we have speak to the devolved administration we have speak to the scottish government and the welsh government and we be work closely and collaborate with they it be important to stress that scheme operate in slightly different way in the case of the welsh administration we think great check and balance be in place in the scheme with local authority and social housing provider think there be collective appetite and desire to work together because everyone agree that home upgrade be fundamental to deliver warm home and cheap bill we need to get the delivery right to make sure we deliver at the scale and pace of our ambition but do so with quality at the heart of it thank the minister for her statement part of my constituency be foot above sea level and our winter can be bitter so good quality insulation scheme be really important welcome the minister emphasis on much well standard but on wide scale can she please tell how she be go to grow the workforce need to deliver these initiative for the future my hon friend be absolutely right build the supply chain and the workforce will be critical to deliver the pace and the scale of our ambition we be already put in place training scheme to build up the next generation of installer and we be work with local and regional government on how to build our supply chain key part of the warm home plan will be work with range of organisation from local to national level to build the supply chain and ensure that through that we be deliver quality job that pay decent wage this be big opportunity there be an opportunity for consumer but we also believe that this be good for the economy include particular local economy and work with local and regional government to ensure that we realise that be priority thank the minister for her statement in which she confirm that the suspend company be suspend from provide new solid wall insulation under the scheme be they also suspend from provide other sort of insulation such as external loft and cavity wall insulation we have suspend the company and under government scheme they will not be do any work on solid wall insulation the vast majority particularly those installer that trustmark believe be risky be prohibit from do other work where we have evidence that some of the company be deliver loft insulation for example and other measure to standard they be allow to do that but we be keep this closely under review trustmark be look at the company constantly and there be big onus on the requirement on those company to deliver and remediate the work in order to be able to any further work congratulate the minister on her sterling work to tackle this minefield of rogue company who abuse the good will of resident when instal energy save measure by scamme they with substandard product and damage their home will she work with colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government to consider extend the scope of this excellent regulation to look at spray foam insulation my historic market town constituency of shrewsbury have many beautiful old property and many old resident it sadden that it be elderly resident such as david and sue and mr and mrs balcombe who be approach by ruthless company offer spray foam insultation despite the fact that it be inappropriate for their old property as consequence of the damage cause those family have face bill after bill for survey and remedial work cost ten of thousand of pound crucially they be now struggle to sell their home as lender will not approve mortgage for home with faulty spray foam insulation david and sue now face bill to replace their roof and sadly mr balcombe pass away recently leave his widow to continue the fight for resolution to this nightmare may ask that family such as those be consider for the same enhance regulation and compensation scheme thank my hon friend for raise the issue in her constituency we be aware of the issue with spray foam insulation indeed number of member from across the house have raise it with we and we be work with mhclg for example we have do lot of work on mortgage and have work with lender to ensure that there be not blanket policy of not give mortgage where there be spray foam insulation within the property we acknowledge that there be problem and that we need to strengthen the regulation assurance and consumer protection across the piece with all energy efficiency measure that be why alongside remediate the immediate issue that we find within and gbis we be work at pace to deliver wholesale regulation of the way the system work over the past year have regularly raise the building industry and its failure to provide decent home of decent quality the one strand that follow all the way through be the failure properly to inspect independently work that have be carry out to certify it and to ensure that it be fit for purpose will the minister ensure that beyond the current audit all future work be properly inspect certify and sign off so that the people receive the insulation can feel confident that the work have be do properly the hon gentleman be right there be poor and weak system of inspection certification and assurance we believe that that be one of the reason why we have end up where we have and we be clear that we must reform that part of the landscape in the end we must command the trust and confidence of consumer and problem such as this fundamentally undermine that trust and confidence as part of reform the system we will look at how we inspect work when it be do how we monitor what have be do and critically how we can have that assurance so that when consumer have work do they can be confident that it be do to the high standard commend the minister for her statement have hear from many constituent in pembrokeshire who have be affect by these scheme with incorrect insulation of air source heat pump faulty or shoddy building work lack of valid warranty grant misuse and regulator such as trustmark simply side with the contractor all of that have disproportionate effect on vulnerable group do the minister agree that it be only thank to this labour government that we be finally sort out the fail system of regulation my hon friend be right to highlight the problem we be find across the piece we be clear that the system we inherit be not fit for purpose it be patchwork of disjoint fragmented regulation and consumer protection it be frankly nightmare for consumer to navigate through and it be not fit for purpose there have to be root and branch overview of how the system work our priority be to ensure that if consumer choose to do home upgrade it be as easy as possible for they to navigate the system and they can have quality the difference between this government and the previous one be that we believe there be role for government there have to be guide mind oversee home upgrade across the piece and we must ensure that the system be deliver for consumer welcome today statement but it be not just about solid wall insulation it be not right that anybody have to take any supplier to the small claim court to get recompense for fix shoddy work trustmark as process be intrinsically ill design to protect vulnerable people because it presume that acceptance of supplier on to the scheme be sufficient safeguard will the minister consider bear in mind what she have already say empower local authority to sign off work before penny be pay the right hon member be right to highlight the important role that local authority can play across the country include in wales where local authority or regional government be oversee this work and provide additional quality and check we be not see the same scope of problem we be look at this in the round we be clear that the status quo be not fit for purpose and that we must put in additional check balance and assurance we think there be lesson to be learn from what be happen in wales and scotland and what be happen in regional and local government welcome my hon friend statement and congratulate she on the detail with which she be answer question and on show how much she be on top of her brief only on friday constituent come to see who have new boiler fit and insulation do under an eco grant the work have be subcontract by the company that originally win the contract and that something that exacerbate the problem that company clearly be not up to the standard require to carry out the work and lot of remedial work be require how can we ensure that the people who win these contract do not subcontract to company that be not capable of carry out the work mean that we end up with the situation the minister have describe my hon friend be right to highlight subcontracting within the system often we find that subcontracting be happen two or three time and the start client be not oversee the work in the way that they should that be why we be clear that we must look at the entire system and part of that be look at who be deliver the work how they be deliver it and how we ensure that there be proper accountability in the system it be obvious to that the current system do not allow for that accountability and that be what put consumer in difficult position be sure the minister will recall our intimate adjournment debate before the house rise for the christmas recess it be just she and here interruption yes and it be the day after our christmas party so it be an interesting debate sincerely welcome the step that the minister have outline for solid wall insulation the problem have be that fundamentally all these issue apply to spray foam insulation as say in my adjournment debate there be blanket ban by some mortgage provider research by the bbc show that one in three of the top mortgage lender have such policy be more than happy to send on that information again there be real issue of fairness and justice here it be right that we be seek to get this right for people do wrong by those who have not instal insulation to spec but the same must be true for those who be victim of the spray foam insulation scandal include my constituent tom and norma in knaresborough the minister have acknowledge in her statement that there be systemic issue that trustmark be not do its work and that there be to be audits of solid wall insulation however when ask whether there be an understanding of how many people have be impact by spray foam insulation be tell that there be not number how can it be that we be count how much of one sort of insulation have be instal but not another some people have be affect by spray foam insulation will she give justice to they too thank the hon member for all the work he have do on spray foam insulation and the campaigning he have do for his constituent fondly remember that adjournment debate with just the two of we and vividly remember the story he tell of tom and norma reiterate the commitment to work together to try to resolve this the difference between spray foam insulation and work do under the eco and gbis scheme be that because those be government back scheme we have the datum large number of people have have spray foam instal and some but not all of that work be do through the green home grant we recognise that there be problem with the system of quality assurance and regulation across the piece we have acknowledge that very clearly in the house we will continue to work with mhclg and other colleague to think about what we can do on spray foam the priority as the hon member will understand be household who have have work do under eco and gbis that if we do not fix it quickly could result in damp and mould we must act quickly on that however acknowledge that there be an issue with household that have spray foam insulation do under the old system as say when we have the debate we will continue work to think about way in which we can resolve that for those household welcome the minister statement and in particular her remark on consumer protection follow on from the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon constituent recently tell at my surgery about work carry out on their home under the last government green home grant follow spray foam insulation be put into their loft they have leak roof that can not be access as well as damp that be not there previously those issue have have huge detrimental impact on their life they find themselves unable to afford remedial work amount to thousand of pound what message can the minister share with my constituent will she meet to discuss spray foam insulation instal under the green home grant scheme will absolutely meet my hon friend to discuss spray foam insulation give the correspondence and parliamentary question have receive on this issue offer to meet with hon member more broadly because we need to ensure that we be listen to constituent if the work be do under the green home grant we need to think about how we can get the system to respond as it should give that commitment to he and other hon member across the house who have case in their constituency and be worried about this apologise to the minister because like the hon member for shrewsbury julia buckley and for bolton west phil brickell and my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon will raise the issue of spray foam my constituent matt be tell that his house be unmortgageable with the nation large building society despite his pay extra for an extensive survey of his timber to prove that there be no problem he have since be force to replace his roof at cost of just to get chance to remortgage and perhaps one day sell his house the roofing company tell he that the market be boom for spray foam removal by the very same people who put it in which feel like exploitation how will the government address that and why be government site still promote and recommend spray foam insulation it be important to stress that the government never recommend particular solution the approach that the last government take and that we have adopt be that in the end people have to find the right measure for their home we never promote any particular measure acknowledge that there be problem with spray foam and that installer in the market be put spray foam in property where it be not fit for purpose we have be do lot of work with colleague at the ministry of housing communities and local government to respond to that point about lender if there be specific case where lender find something problematic despite survey say that it be absolutely fine please feed that through to we as we be continue to work with the industry on that there should not be blanket ban it be important to stress that where spray foam insulation be carry out well and be appropriate for property it be good thing but agree that there be too many case where it have not be carry out well and be not appropriate therefore extend an offer to meet we need to think about what we will do in response we have inherit this system and wish could change the past but can not what we can do be draw line under it we can absolutely ensure that we reform the system so that this never happen again and so that we can command the trust of consumer my constituent have unfortunately face double whammy of not only have have defective cavity wall insulation instal but be pursue by law firm such as ssb for adverse legal cost consumer be badly let down and we need to ensure that do not happen again will the minister assure we that this will not happen again under future programme such as the new warm home plan on pipeline be the government work cross departmentally to ensure that we have the right skill and training for future programme we want to ensure confidence in the system let reassure my hon friend that we be absolutely work to ensure that the lesson learn from the scheme we inherit be apply to the warm home plan as we develop it and that we put in place system for check assurance and advice so that consumer can have confidence we be work across government because build up the supply chain and make sure that we have installer with the skill to do the work well be an absolute priority we be work to deliver that thank the minister for comprehensive response and as importantly for give hope to all those people affect that assure people and give they confidence through their elect representative in this house in northern ireland we have the affordable warmth scheme which be different but the goal be the same shortcoming have be identify will the minister be so helpful as to share the lesson learn with the northern ireland assembly and the relevant northern ireland minister that be vital if something go wrong here the lesson learn could help we to solve problem in northern ireland we will engage with colleague in northern ireland we be work closely with all the devolved administration we be build up the evidence base on what happen and think about our response and we be keen to share with other authority any insight that we gain holocaust memorial day beg to move that this house have consider holocaust memorial day it be an immense privilege to open this important debate on behalf of the government as hon member will know year ago this month soldier of the soviet army of the first ukrainian front open the gate of auschwitz birkenau that infamous camp have become the symbol of the shoah and be synonymous around the world with terror and genocide more widely its distinctive railway track that lead almost directly to the gas chamber as well as the chill word over the gate of the auschwitz main camp arbeit macht frei be instantly recognisable as be the pile of shoe suitcase and other personal effect the only remnant of the more than million jewish man woman and child from every corner of europe who perish at the site almost all the deportee who arrive at auschwitz birkenau camp be immediately select for death in the gas chamber it be estimate that the ss and police deport at least million people to the complex between and of these the camp authority murder million on monday world leader will gather at auschwitz birkenau to mark the anniversary of its liberation the united kingdom will be represent by his majesty the king mala tribich mbe holocaust survivor and sister of the late sir ben helfgott may his memory be blessing will also attend the number of those who survive the shoah be dwindle as you will know madam deputy speaker those who remain with we grow ever frailer as result this be likely to be the last gathering of holocaust survivor eighty year ago the us army armoured division liberate buchenwald the large concentration camp on german soil general later president dwight eisenhower write afterward have never feel able to describe my emotional reaction when first come face to face with indisputable evidence of nazi brutality and ruthless disregard of every shred of decency eighty year ago british force liberate concentration camp in northern germany include neuengamme and bergen belsen they enter the bergen belsen concentration camp which be about km from hanover in mid april some prisoner many in critical condition because of typhus epidemic be find alive within three month of liberation more than of they have die from the effect of malnutrition or disease bbc journalist richard dimbleby famously describe the scene of almost unimaginable horror that greet he as he tour belsen concentration camp shortly after its liberation bergen belsen begin as prisoner of war camp and be use for jewish inmate from onwards it be estimate that people die there richard dimbleby be the first broadcaster to enter the camp and overcome break down several time while make his report the bbc initially refuse to play the report as it could not believe the scene he have describe it be broadcast only after dimbleby threaten to resign the image from belsen emaciated figure lie half dead on open ground in freeze weather while thousand of corps be bulldoze into great pit be excruciating to see to this day some of the first hand witness simply can not bring themselves to speak of it it haunt they to this day over the decade holocaust survivor many of whom experience belsen or auschwitz have share their testimony but year after the holocaust their number be dwindle and soon these first hand witness will no long be with we the remarkable lily ebert mbe die age at home in london last october her life after auschwitz show that even in the face of unspeakable evil the human spirit can triumph she emerge from the darkness to bear harrowing witness but also to rebuild hope with future generation may her memory be blessing henry wuga aged and bob kirk aged who both come to the uk on the kindertransport die in both man dedicate their life to holocaust education the impact that lily henry and bob have on young and old can not be overestimate and highlight the importance of first hand testimony both because of the alarming rise in anti jewish hate in recent year and because those who survive be now in their and it be essential that as country we do more to preserve the memory of this unique act of evil and those who perish in it it be also imperative that we continue to educate future generation about what happen both as mark of respect to those who be lose and those who survive and as warning about what happen when antisemitism prejudice and hatred be allow to flourish unchecked some year ago former swedish prime minister göran persson decide to establish an international organisation that would expand holocaust education worldwide he ask president bill clinton and former british prime minister tony blair to join he in that effort persson also develop the idea of an international forum of government interested in discuss holocaust education which take place in stockholm from to january the forum be attend by representative of government include head of state or prime ministers and deputy prime ministers or ministers the declaration of the stockholm international forum lead to the establishment of holocaust memorial day on january and the foundation of the international holocaust remembrance alliance this year the uk have the privilege of hold the chair of the ihra and it continue to have an excellent reputation in the field of holocaust remembrance and education and tackle antisemitism we be fortunate in the uk to have organisation such as the holocaust educational trust lead by karen pollock cbe and the holocaust memorial day trust lead by olivia marks woldman obe the holocaust educational trust which have work with holocaust survivor for decade be well aware of the increase frailty of survivor and that there will come day when we no long have living witness that be why it have recently develop with the support of the government free digital education programme that combine digital eyewitness testimony with virtual reality revolutionise access to survivor testimony and provide an invaluable opportunity for student learn about the holocaust the uk take on the presidency of the ihra in with the world on the cusp of significant change in holocaust remembrance within few short year holocaust survivor will move from contemporary memory into history book how we remember be matter of debate but different view coalesce around three heading landscape archive include testimony and object our presidency have successfully strengthen all three under the general title of in plain sight this title be reminder that the holocaust do not happen in dark corner but in broad daylight jewish man woman and child suffer persecution in the full view of their neighbour indeed often by their neighbour law discriminate against jews and deprive they of right and property be pass openly by legislature the attempt destruction of the jewish people and their culture be not conduct in secret but brazenly and openly our presidency be also keen to engage young people through our remarkably successful my hometown project which invite school across ihra member country to look at what happen in their hometown during the holocaust school in former occupy country and those receive victim of nazis and their collaborator produce original and moving project school participate from as far afield as argentina greece canada and poland alongside other member country include the uk project range widely in their subject matter one focus on the influence of holocaust survivor flee to argentina on the music of argentinian tango in nottingham an amazing teacher domonic townsend from the nottingham university samworth academy work on remarkable project the school house specialist provision unit for deaf child alongside the nottinghamshire deaf society domonic create the first holocaust specific sign language lexicon for access holocaust education to empower our young child to access that education in an inclusive way urge all hon member to watch the video on youtube it be truly inspiring the uk presidency also work with the association of jewish refugees on our legacy project the holocaust testimony portal which pull together for the first time testimony from uk holocaust survivor and refugee who make their home in britain this include testimony from the ajr refugee voices initiative the uk holocaust memorial foundation the shoah foundation and many more archive hopefully more archive particularly the small more specialised one will join in the come month the portal allow user to find in single place the testimony of individual survivor across the decade to commemorate the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz birkenau we have develop with the ajr the digital project live collection of one minute clip feature object from filmed testimony of british holocaust survivor and refugee the object represent the personal history and experience of jewish holocaust survivor and refugee before during and at the end of the second world war object such as teddy bear doll watch or spoon take on special meaning passport stamp with the letter yellow star and bowl from bergen belsen be bittersweet remnant of lost world eighty year after the holocaust we sadly still contend with holocaust denial some form of denial be less common and in some state it be now illegal and punishable under the law but the form that holocaust denial can take be ever change it once refer to those who claim that million jews be not murder and that there be no gas chamber whatsoever today these outright denier be few and mostly relegate to the fringe the problem we face today be more complex and more subtle and be often nuance and difficult to identify however that do not render they less dangerous or the need to challenge they less compelling after all we be live in an age when fact be routinely dispute and disinformation and misinformation be rampant this present real and present danger for holocaust education remembrance and research it have be long process even for democratic country to confront their own problematic history it be only in that the french government accept responsibility for the deportation and death of more than jews and that austria finally dispel the myth of be hitler first victim and make amend to austrian nazi victim we have all watch the misinformation emanating from russia that try to justify the war in ukraine as denazification but across eastern europe fascist leader of the past who be involve in the persecution of jews but who fight communism be shamefully be rehabilitate and in some case give public honour lithuania genocide and resistance research centre decide that the leader of the nazi ally lithuanian activist front be worthy of such honour hungary government build new museum that would tread lightly on the role of local collaborator even in romania which have do so much to confront its own problematic history the church be canonise religious leader who be know for their wartime antisemitism other form of distortion have come about more quietly follow un recommendation dozen of country now mark international holocaust remembrance day with special programme and educational initiative this be real achievement but it have bring with it universalising of the holocaust and its meaning there be however general lesson on how hatred and intolerance can lead to discrimination exclusion and even mass murder and the need to be open to asylum seeker flee for their life yet with grow frequency the essential story of the holocaust the pernicious spread of antisemitism the widespread indifference and the genocidal murder of third of the world jewish population be obscure or ignore it be as though antisemitism be no long problem and jews be no long threaten surely this can not be the message that holocaust commemoration carry with it we must guard against the watering down of holocaust memorial day it be day when central to all our commemoration should be the murder of million jewish man woman and child today holocaust denial and distortion move instantan eously across social medium platform and be amplify by algorithm that drive anger and division sadly the alarming resurgence of antisemitism since october show how the hate of the past be still with we today and every day we stand in solidarity with the jewish community at home and abroad the theme for holocaust memorial day for well future be particularly timely because remembrance without resolve be hollow gesture even as we remember the past we must be ever vigilant about the present and future that be why we have duty to remember and why the new holocaust memorial and learn centre at the heart of westminster be so important in keep alive the memory of those murder during the holocaust finally it would be remiss of not to mention the long await ceasefire between israel and hamas that begin on sunday february as part of the agreement we see the release of three of the israeli hostage who be take from their home and from music festival on october and the release of hundred of palestinians one of the hostage be british citizen emily damari who have now be reunite with her family include her mother amanda who never stop her tireless fight to bring her daughter home we wish all three hostage the very good as they begin the road to recovery after the intolerable trauma they have experience yet while we rightly welcome the ceasefire deal we must not forget about those who remain in captivity under hamas we must now see the remain phase of the ceasefire deal implement in full and on schedule include the release of the remain hostage and surge of humanitarian aid into gaza hopefully these first tentative step will lead to lasting solution with the people of israel and the palestinians live side by side in peace the uk stand ready to do everything it can to support that hope for permanent and peaceful solution look forward to hear the rest of the debate call the shadow minister it be my privilege and solemn duty to open this debate on behalf of the opposition thank the minister for his very thoughtful remark the theme of this year holocaust memorial day for well future encourage we to reflect on the lesson of history and on the step we must take to ensure that such atrocity never happen again this holocaust memorial day also mark the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz birkenau place where more than million jewish people lose their life part of the million victim who also include the disabled member of the gay community and political opponent of the nazi regime we should always strive to stamp out the evil that be antisemitism it have no place in our society or any society early this month like other be honour to sign the holocaust educational trust book of commitment and today be honour to speak in this important debate pay tribute to the trust for its outstanding work in keep the memory of the holocaust alive through educational outreach and keep the holocaust in our curriculum for more than year also thank the survivor of the holocaust for the work they have do to educate past present and future generation on the horror of the past and to give we lesson for the future my party will always support the jewish community so it be encouraging to see the leader of the opposition engage with the board of deputies of british jews the jewish leadership council and the community security trust to discuss the challenge face the jewish community as part of my role as shadow secretary of state be meet the jewish leadership council in february and look forward to engage with it and other jewish organisation in the future our party will continue to engage with the community in opposition and together we reaffirm our commitment to tackle antisemitism promote community cohesion and hold this government to account on these critical issue this debate and this period of reflection come at an important moment for the middle east which we hope will usher in sustainable end to the conflict every single hostage must be return safely home and reunite with family and friend after month of the most unimaginably cruel captivity at the hand of hamas we have firmly in our thought the victim of the october terror attack those who lose their life and those whose life have be change forever this be the bad terror attack in israel history we be all relieve to see the first return of hostage back to their love one under the recent ceasefire agreement include as the minister say the british israeli national emily damari we pray for their good health and sincerely hope they can now begin to rebuild their life after the most unimaginable trauma none of the hostage or their family ever deserve to be put through this nightmare remember the holocaust be something that we must continue to do every day and every year it can not be forget this debate be just one way of do that and it be the responsibility of all of we to do so in our own way indeed my wife and take our child to the holocaust gallery at the imperial war museum which be very solemn and sober experience for we all that day we also visit the kindertransport memorial at liverpool street station how proud we should be of those people such as nicholas winton who play their part to help jewish people flee the horror of nazi persecution save countless life and offer hope to those face darkness it be also important that we take this opportunity to remember all those kill in genocide around the world we remember the atrocity in rwanda where over people be murder this year also mark year since the srebrenica massacre in bosnia where more than mainly man and boy be kill in just few day by bosnian serb force most be kill in an organised and systemic fashion blindfold and shoot while it be mainly man and boy who be murder thousand of woman and girl suffer unthinkable violence and sexual abuse include rape and torture with thousand more include child and the elderly abuse and displace those horror remind we of the vital importance of stand against hate wherever it arise that be why this debate on holocaust memorial day be so important we must stamp out antisemitism and stop it impact the life of british jews and jews around the world but we also owe it to the memory of all victim of genocide to educate future generation and to work tirelessly to prevent history repeat itself let we honour their memory by build well future free from hate division and violence each year holocaust memorial day serve as powerful reminder of the horror that humanity be capable of inflict and of where antisemitism can lead for this day be not just time to remember the million jews murder across europe but an opportunity to reflect on their personal story include my own family critically this day be also chance to renew our solemn pledge never again which have particular meaning for and my family my father be holocaust survivor he be bear in budapest in in spring after nazi germany invade hungary he be herd along with ten of thousand of other jews into the ghetto in munkács his mother hometown over just two month more than hungarian jews be deport to auschwitz the vast majority of whom be murder many member of my family count among their number and do not survive but my father do and so do my grandmother thank to the extraordinary bravery of woman name maria in last desperate throw of the dice my family entrust my infant father to her care she risk everything to smuggle he and short time later my grandmother out of the ghetto just day before it be liquidate maria courage be extraordinary her willingness to risk her own freedom and maybe even her own life for stranger and her child be testament to the power of human decency even in the darkest of time often think of what the last tearful meeting where my great grandparent bade farewell to my father barely month old know that they would never see he again must have be like think of my grandmother force to live under false identity for the remainder of the war not know what happen to her family and think of maria whom never meet and who know little about but to whom owe so much in these moment the enormity of what happen hit hard few year ago take my family to the holocaust memorial at yad vashem there in its file of those who perish look up my family on my father father side now my name be pretty unusual but among the name of those who be murder find literally hundred of duschinskys know be not alone in that my family story be far from unique there be million of jewish family with story like mine story of loss trauma and persecution but also of survival and not just jewish family there be so many other other victim of nazi persecution as well as survivor of the rwandan genocide and those in bosnia darfur and cambodia who have similar story to tell victim of hatred victim of persecution they be bind together by common experience and common humanity holocaust memorial day be particularly important this year it come at moment of dawn hope after month of darkness with the release of three hostage include emily damari and ceasefire in gaza pray for the safe release of all the hostage for the ceasefire to be sustain and for we to take the first step towards sustained peace but january be also critically important this year because it mark the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz it be hugely significant milestone for those of we who know survivor it will be the last major anniversary when we have they with we in hendon we be enormously proud of the work of our local survivor include manfred goldberg renee salt vera schaufeld peter and marianne summerfield and my good friend rabbi bernd koschland all of whom have do so much work to raise awareness yet with each anniversary the holocaust slowly but surely slip from live memory as the generation of survivor pass on so the responsibility fall upon we to ensure that their story endure the torch of remembrance be be pass and it be down to we the people here today to safeguard the memory of the holocaust to spread understanding tell its story and keep they alive for our child and grandchild this be not just about the number and statistic we must remember the people the family the community we must speak for they and where we can make sure their story and voice be hear especially in an age when misinformation proliferate when truth compete with blizzard of distortion and lie and when conspiratorial thinking and shrill rhetoric numb we to true horror we can not rely on the fact of the holocaust alone to speak for themselves we must tell its story insistently and repeatedly and make sure they reach every ear that be why the work of the holocaust memorial day trust in run holocaust memorial day be so important and why the work of the holocaust educational trust the association of jewish refugees and so many other charity be so vital it be why the government pledge to ensure that the holocaust will be at the core of national curriculum that be teach in every school be so welcome as be the extra million in funding for the het it be also why the deep personal commitment of the prime minister see in his strong advocacy and his recent trip to auschwitz be so critical this anniversary be not just about remembering it be about reaffirm our collective commitment to the value that ensure such atrocity can never happen again that be why the importance of holocaust memorial day can not be overstate it be not only time of reflection but time of vigilance and time when we renew our vow to act because as history often remind we prejudice and bigotry be light sleeper at time when antisemitic incident be up over we can see that hatred particularly the world old hatred be never fully vanquish it must be fight and defeat anew with every generation in britain we take pride in our pluralistic society society where people be free to practice their religion express their identity and live without fear of persecution but we must always remember that those freedom must never be take for grant they be the product of long history of struggle and sacrifice and they be something we must constantly protect and defend in our politic our rhetoric and our daily life we can all play our part this come monday at pm urge everyone who can to tune in to bbc one for the national ceremony of commemoration at pm ask everyone to light candle and put it in their window light in the darkness to keep memory alive the theme of this year holocaust memorial day be for well future the path to well future one where tolerance and mutual respect trump division and bigotry lie in steadfast defence of our value and willingness to confront hate the foundation of this determination in turn rest on our collective remembrance of the holocaust and our determination to tell its story and echo its truth down the generation know something about that because that be the path my family trod it seem unlikely that baby boy in ghetto leave his family in the arm of stranger might be on path to well future but because of their decency and bravery he find his way to place of safety he travel to new country that be bastion of those value country in which his son be able to carry his family name name that be on the verge of extinction into parliament and sit surround by so many colleague whose own family story be mark by hardship and oppression that be why be so proud to sit here and to be co sponsor of this debate the lesson this journey teach we be that path to well future be possible if we work together to build it on this holocaust memorial day we should renew our determination to strive to build it every day call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be privilege to speak in this debate and it be humble to follow the hon member for hendon david pinto duschinsky thank he for his incredible testimony about his family pay tribute to mr speaker and his office for the move parliamentary ceremony yesterday especially the testimony of yisrael and alf who both survive the nazi holocaust to mark this event in the same week as the fragile ceasefire in the middle east and the release of emily damari and two other hostage make it even more poignant when my son isaac be nine his school springdale first hold world war two tea child be invite to bring grandparent to share their memory of live through the war but he come home distressed because my parent his grandparent be not bear until several year after its end be an ingenious child he knock on the door of our neighbour margaret and ask she to be his

parliamentary group on uk israel this holocaust memorial day be particularly prominent and poignant as it mark the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz birkenau the large concentration camp during the war time be go quickly and many of the courageous and inspirational survivor be sadly pass away so it be important that we preserve their memory and story and teach the next generation so that we do not make the same mistake again think have speak in every holocaust memorial debate since be elect in and today will focus on the origin of the holocaust and on how the united kingdom could and should have do more to prevent it the holocaust be one of the most tragic event the world have ever see the brutal systematic murder of million jewish man woman and child by the nazis in germany and their collaborator during the second world war must always serve as stark reminder of the evil that can be perpetrate by humankind the jewish genocide do not officially start until january but jews have be irrationally target throughout the century date back to as early as bc do not intend to go through the history of that let we fast forward to the end of the great war when the escalation of antisemitism be about to begin the ally force sanction germany extremely harshly at the end of the great war germany have to accept full blame for the war and pay billion in today money that be huge amount because of the damage it cause during the war alsace lorraine which have be take from france by germany in the war be return to the french and the anschluss be ban germany be allow to have only soldier with no tank and no air force and its navy could have maximum of six battleship the rhineland an area of germany on the border with france be demilitarised and woodrow wilson idea for league of nations be agree to the reparation cause immense problem for the german people who universally believe that they be too harsh not least because of the damage and instability that they cause to the german economy many hold lot of anger and be ready to shift their blame which fall on the jews shortly after that be the great depression spark by the wall street stock market crash of economy across the globe be affect lead to crisis in world trade price and employment almost overnight the regular loan from the united states through the dawes plan on which the german economy depend cease hitler rise star in the german political scene at the time promise that the humiliation of versailles would be avenge and that germany would be make great again many germans believe that they have be betray by the high command of the army in the great war and they be tired of endless ineffective coalition government follow the war hitler have no connection to the elite and he offer new beginning most of all he promise job and bread at time when unemployment and poverty be at extremely high level it be important to ask the question if we have act differently after the great war would hitler ever have come to power of course we know that he do and that his nazis embark on systematic and deliberate attempt at extinguish the jewish race across europe next monday mark the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz which be the large concentration and extermination camp use by the nazis the site consist of auschwitz which be the main camp auschwitz ii birkenau concentration and extermination camp with gas chamber and incinerator auschwitz iii monowitz labour camp for the chemical conglomerate ig farben and dozen of other sub camp the camp become major site of the nazis horrific final solution to the jewish question between and late freight train deliver jews from all over nazi occupy europe and collaborator from across those different country join in shocking million people be send to auschwitz where million be sadly murder some be jews of whom be gas on arrival have be single out for immediate extinction about non jewish poles romani soviet prisoner of war and other be also kill those who be send to the camp but escape be gas be murder through starvation exhaustion disease individual execution or beating other be kill during torturous medical experiment we should remember what that must have be like the first mass transport to arrive at auschwitz on june contain polish male political prisoner include catholic priest and jews by transport be arrive regularly contain thousand of jews who be all earmark for execution if inmate be lucky enough not to be send straight to the gas chamber on arrival they be send to the prisoner reception centre where they be tattooed shave disinfect and give striped prison uniform the horror escalate dramatically from there youth and fitness for work gain prisoner temporary reprieve from the gas chamber from the time they enter auschwitz birkenau everything be do to debase and dehumanise the jews their immediate gassing be delay in order to rob they of their individuality each be identify solely by the number that he or she be designate the day would start at am with roll call prisoner would walk to their place of work wear striped uniform and ill fitting wooden shoe without sock kapos the prisoner supervisor be responsible for the prisoner behaviour and conformity while they work as be an ss escort the work day last hour and be mark by torture and fatigue much of the work take place at construction site quarry and lumber yard visit to the latrine be permit only at designate time not when nature call work be carry out in the shadow and smoke of the crematoria chimney that burn incessantly day and night burn the body of murder jews and other invariably include the family member of those force to work the belching smoke be constant reminder of their potential fate in the evening after block inspection there be second mandatory roll call if prisoner be miss the other have to remain in place until he or she be find or the reason for his or her absence discover after roll call individual and collective punishment be mete out before the prisoner be permit to return to their barrack for the night and receive their bread ration and water prisoner receive hot drink in the morning but no breakfast and watery meatless turnip soup at noon in the evening they receive small ration of bread at no time do their daily intake exceed calorie sanitary condition be poor with inadequate latrine and lack of water the camp be infest with vermin such as disease carry lice inmate suffer and die during epidemic of typhus and other contagious disease while we commemorate year since auschwitz be liberate it be important to note that there be main camp across europe each with series of internal camp total over camp in all all dedicate to the torture and extermination of the jewish community to implement the final solution during the latter year of the war the nazis build extermination camp on polish soil we must remember chelmno belzec sobibor treblinka majdanek and of course auschwitz birkenau commend the holocaust memorial day trust and the holocaust educational trust for their brilliant work to educate we about the horror that people endure urge the minister to confirm funding for the holocaust educational trust wonderful lesson from auschwitz programme so that young people can learn what happen it be clear that the nazis deliberately set out to kill the million jews but there be many action that we in the uk and the united states could have take auschwitz be access by vast network of rail route bring train full of jews from across europe at no point do the ally force choose to bomb those rail network to prevent access to the camp in the us department of war refuse multiple request from jewish leader to bomb the railway line lead to the camp despite bomber of the air force fly along and across the deportation railway line on their way to bomb the blechhammer oil refinery just week later time and again military commander say that precision strike on the camp have no chance of success however no study be ever make proposal to drop weapon into the camp to enable rebellion be consider but abandon from to british intelligence be regularly able to intercept and decode radio message send by the german order police which include daily prisoner return and death toll for the concentration camp include auschwitz yet no action be take another common argument be that the ally do not know the number and the horror of the camp until after the war despite the fact that hundred of prisoner escape and describe their ordeal the us office of strategic services the predecessor of the central intelligence agency that have be establish in to co ordinate intelligence and espionage activity in enemy territory have receive report about auschwitz in but no action be take to target the camp on april two young jewish inmate who have escape from the camp rudolf vrba and alfréd wetzler publish detailed information about the camp geography the gas chamber and the number be kill roswell mcclelland the us war refugee board representative in switzerland be know to have receive copy by mid june and send it to the board executive director but no action be take we be year on from the liberation of auschwitz antisemitism have increase significantly in the uk and globally follow the october attack by hamas and the subsequent war in gaza many uk community feel vulnerable with hostility and suspicion of other rise we hope that holocaust memorial day can be an opportunity for people to come together learn from and about the past and take action to make well future for all finish on two point first it be extremely concern to see the stark rise in open antisemitism on our street follow the october attack on israel by the terrorist organisation hamas jewish people be afraid to go about their life and have to hide their identity for fear of be attack in their own country we have reiterate time and again that the holocaust must serve as reminder that we must never allow such persecution of any race or religion so we must make conscious effort to stand up against such violation on our own street secondly the minister kindly mention the holocaust memorial bill which be go through parliament sadly as time move forward survivor be pass and there be few and few to share their story it be crucial that we enable the holocaust memorial to be build alongside this place together with the education centre so that future generation can learn the true horror of what happen during the war and pass it on to their child so that we never allow history to repeat itself have have the privilege of visit the original yad vashem and the modern day yad vashem those who visit will know the horror that the jewish people encounter and it be hard to express those horror we must make the bill passage matter of urgency so that the few holocaust survivor still with we can see the centre for themselves and be proud of the amazing work they have do in share their story leave the house with the poignant word of sir ben helfgott mbe holocaust survivor and successful olympic weightlifter his word should resonate with we all when assess the urgency of this project look forward to one day take my family to the new national memorial and learn centre tell the story of britain and the holocaust and one day hope that my child and grandchild will take their child and grandchild and that they will remember all those who come before they include my mother sara my sister luisa and my father moishe sadly sir ben

holocaust and vow never to repeat they it be an immense privilege to speak in this debate and express my heartfelt support for holocaust memorial day this day be not merely reflection on single tragedy in human history it be time to remember the million jewish man woman and child murder during the holocaust and to honour those who survive pay tribute to my hon friend the member for hendon david pinto duschinsky for such moving personal speech on the importance of honour those who survive the theme for this year for well future resonate deeply it call on each of we to reflect on our

other characteristic five week before the horrific massacre commit by hamas in have the opportunity to visit israel and the palestinian territory as part of delegation during that visit meet leader from both side of long stand conflict also witness something that leave lasting impression on young people both jewish israelis and muslim palestinians who be critical of their leader but unite in their share desire for peace they like we want an end to the cycle of violence and they want leadership that will guide they towards well future that be message that will hold on to during my visit have the profound honour of experience yad vashem the exhibit document testimony and historical artefact tell story that be truly harrowing what strike most be the reminder that the holocaust do not occur in isolation or overnight but be the culmination of year of cultivate hatred prejudice and dehumanisation the horror of the holocaust be not just the atrocity itself it be the slow erosion of civility and the gradual unravelling of humanity that be why we must continue to resist antisemitism islamophobia and all discrimination and persecution in every form holocaust memorial day be about understand how hatred creep into society and how we as individual and community must prevent they from take root again education play vital role in that process and welcome this government announcement and the focus on teach the holocaust so that we ensure that pupil understand why and how it happen more locally want to express my sincere gratitude to joan livesey for her dedication in organise holocaust memorial event in my constituency and beyond her work with school to engage young people in learn about the holocaust be essential in ensure that that history be never forget one such event will be hold at leigh film factory poignant screening of sophie scholl the final days those effort be crucial they create space for community to come together to reflect on such horrific event they also remind we of the value we must all work towards in this house tolerance acceptance and mutual respect for all people regardless of their background wherever hatred exist whether it be in the uk or elsewhere we must challenge it we must confront the language of hate and bigotry wherever it be find and ensure that we never allow those force to gain foothold again be pleased to contribute to this important debate thank those individual and organisation that work throughout the year to ensure that holocaust memorial day be commemorate and that our young people in particular be remind of the horror of the past and encourage to work towards the peace that all right think people seek as member will be aware holocaust memorial day fall every year on january as have be mention that be the date when the notorious auschwitz birkenau camp be liberate this year the date mark year since that liberation and it be just as important now as it have be in any year to remember the million jewish victim of the holocaust and the million of other victim of nazi persecution along with those who have be victim of genocide since then sadly year on antisemitism be at an all time high as be anti muslim hatred for that reason want to focus on the srebrenica genocide which take place in july during the bosnian war despite the international community pledge after the holocaust that mass atrocity would never again occur they have remain feature of the world since world war two as we see in bosnia just year ago while be work as the constituency agent for the father of the house my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh study part time at lincoln university for politics degree one of the unit be on the break up of the former yugoslavia when be fortunate enough to be elect to this house become involved in the all party group for the western balkan nation and be then appoint the prime minister trade envoy to that region have visit srebrenica on two occasion and challenge anyone who visit site where genocide have take place to be anything other than move by the experience how can such evil be perpetrate there seem to be no end to man inhumanity to man the same emotion be stir when visit war graf in france belgium or elsewhere in be part of delegation to gaza thing be bad there then but they be much bad now one of my abide memory be of visit the commonwealth war grave cemetery there it be small compare to many but as we be remind in november each year the tombstone stand row on row the local man and his son who care for the graf if remember correctly the man name be ibrahim do so much with as much care as if they be tend to their own family plot when focus on the evil that be perpetrate in our world we must never lose sight of the goodness exemplify by those who like ibrahim show love and care often as in that cemetery in gaza for those they never know both of my visit to srebrenica be lead by our former colleague colonel bob stewart whose affection for the country and its people be self evident we be privileged to witness his interaction with local people in there be bosniak muslim man and boy murder during the massacre of srebrenica those murder be mainly commit by unit of the bosnian serb army of republika srpska in what be recognise as the bad crime on european soil since world war two understand that the massacre in srebrenica town in eastern bosnia and herzegovina be the first legally recognise genocide in europe since the end of world war two those event follow bosnia declare independence from yugoslavia in move that be resist by the bosnian serb population who want to be part of great serbia sadly bosnian serbs be prepared to achieve that goal by isolate ethnic group their own neighbour and if necessary exterminate they campaign of war crime ethnic cleansing and genocide be commit on the non serb population of the former yugoslavia and the bosnian war culminate in the death of around people and the displacement of more than million man woman and child in july bosnian serb troop and paramilitary descend on the town of srebrenica and begin shell it when those troop take the town they proceed to separate bosniak man and boy over the age of from woman and young child over the course of several day more than bosniak muslim man and boy be murder in and around srebrenica merely because of their ethnicity shockingly the perpetrator be often former neighbour classmate and teacher of those they persecute they murder both young and old understand that the eld be year old and the young nearly five they be kill in some of the most brutal and barbaric way imaginable and their body be bulldoze into mass graf in an attempt to conceal they the testimony of survivor be harrowing there be report of child be murder by soldier with knife the body of elderly man lie on the ground with their eye gouge out and the mass rape of woman and even child one can find it very difficult to believe the horror that man be capable of and when visit srebrenica one be remind of the evil that can take place even in mainland europe in fact it be important that we note that those atrocity do not take place in some faraway land in an age long past but right here in europe on our doorstep less than three decade ago many of the child who witness these atrocity at first hand who see thing that no child should ever see be adult now with young child of their own that be how recent this genocide be as such the commemoration of these event should serve as warning to we all particularly those in government or in position of influence of what can happen here in europe which in the main in the post war period we tend to think of as civilised safe and secure particularly compare with many part of this troubled and become ever more troubled world holocaust memorial day remind we where prejudice fear and hatred can lead particularly if they become normalise and encourage the theme for holocaust memorial day be for well future it be only by learn from the past that we can strive for that well future evil can it seem enter the heart and mind of man of all race and creed as the service of compline in the book of common prayer say we must be vigilant because our adversary the devil as roar lion walketh about seek whom he may devour those be stark word sadly the devil can enter the heart of people especially when propaganda and evil leadership be involve we must never forget the brutality of which man be capable and it be right that we use parliamentary time to commemorate these horrific event the atrocity now take place across the world remind we that we must remain eternally vigilant the uk voice on this matter be important and be proud that we have contribute over many generation to the attempt to bring peace and stability to many troubled part of the world the tragic event of the holocaust and of other genocide since then such as at srebrenica must never be forget and we must continue to speak out on this issue if we hope for our child and our grandchild to have well future thank the minister and the shadow minister for their contribution also thank my hon friend the member for hendon david pinto duschinsky for the move story about his family like many other member who have speak today too have visit yad vashem in july nothing quite prepare you to stand in the hall of names surround by the image of those who perish in the holocaust and the pages of testimony that detail their life live so cruelly and brutally cut short by the great act of mass murder in human history to describe they simply as victim robs they once again of their humanity dignity and individuality as benjamin fondane the french romanian poet who be murder at auschwitz just three month before its liberation write remember only that be innocent and just like you mortal on that day too have have face mark by rage by pity and joy quite simply human face two day after visit yad vashem visit kibbutz kfar aza quiet unassuming kibbutz close to the border with gaza found on socialist principle by mizrahi refugee from morocco and egypt in none of we who visit that day know that within week its peace and tranquillity would be shatter the kibbutznik would be rap and murder and hostage would be take include our own emily damari whose release alongside the two other hostage at the weekend have provide glimmer of light in the darkness now we must make sure that all the hostage come home to their family none of we know that day that on october the jewish people would suffer the bloodiest day in their history since the terrible event of eight decade ago which we mark today that modern day pogrom be commit by hamas an organisation that share the same genocidal aspiration and sadistic fervour of those who perpetrate the holocaust and none of we know that day that within hour of those terrorist attack britain would see the first wave of antisemitic incident which last year reach their high ever record total it be beyond shameful that in century britain jewish place of worship be deface and graffitie and require protection by security guard that jewish pupil be unable to wear their uniform on the way to school and that jewish student be intimidate on our campus all the while antisemite take to our street chant for jihad glorify hamas crime and compare the state of israel to those who seek to annihilate european jewry less than century ago but britain be not unique in amsterdam israeli football fan have be hunt attack and abuse on the eve of the anniversary of kristallnacht in melbourne synagogue be set alight while worshipper be sit inside and in the uae young rabbi be kidnap and murder each one of these crime remind we that hatred against jews and hatred against the world jewish state can not be separate anti zionist antisemitism be simply the late iteration of history old hatred as the prime minister rightly say last week while visit auschwitz but where be never again when we see the poison of antisemitism rise around the world in the aftermath of october be proud that our prime minister and this government be commit to tackle that evil commend the board of deputies of british jews the jewish leadership council the community security trust the holocaust educational trust the holocaust memorial day trust

and hatred must be fight on many front and it be on all of we to join that fight for well future we can not be bystander wish to close with the word of elie wiesel on the peril of indifference and the danger of passivity we must always take side neutrality help the oppressor never the victim silence encourage the tormentor never the tormented be very grateful to the government for make time for the house to debate the important topic of holocaust remembrance ahead of monday holocaust memorial day day of solemn remembrance and reflection on that day year will have pass since the death camp auschwitz birkenau be liberate yet the memory remain as poignant as ever largely due to the day that we mark every year six million jewish man woman and child be brutally murder by the nazis and

shockat adam thank you madam deputy speaker hate be the bad letter word that exist say holocaust survivor mathilde middleberg be deeply honour to be call in the debate as movingly articulate by the hon member for hendon david pinto duschinsky year have pass since the liberation of auschwitz but it be heartbreaking to see act of genocide hate and evil still happen across the world and increase threat from new wind of far right the horror of the camp must never be forget and the testimony of the survivor be still ring in our ear and be as relevant today as they be year ago because what be year in the history of the world but blink of an eye yet sadly current event suggest that some people today need reminder of the lesson of that horror for the anniversary of the liberation of bergen belsen the university of leicester in my constituency publish extract from the east midland oral history archive of an interview with leicester nurse erti wilford erti treat the survivor of belsen for two year after its liberation by the british army she speak of approach bergen belsen and smell the dreadful smell from as far away as five mile say that she have never see so much suffering and lice and filth at belsen they be just bag of bone and it be just dreadful but some of they live it be quite incredible erti recall the excitement of camp doctor finally be allow to deliver baby and return it back to its mother rather than hand it to guard for execution we must remember the name of anne and margot frank whose final resting place be bergen belsen they unfortunately die of typhus approximately month before the liberation one would hope that such experience mean that hate and genocidal and nazi action be thing of the past but sadly that be not the case as articulate by the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers in bosnia the truck arrive and they say man young and old tall and short get on and we will transport you to safety within two week muslim man woman and child be execute commend hon member for their contribution would the hon member join in congratulate organisation such as remembering srebrenica which have do so much to remember those muslim boy and

we have see genocide in rwanda where close to million tutsi be kill and now as we speak in sudan if never again mean anything it mean that the international community must take decisive action to pursue the perpetrator through the international court of justice instead the far right be almost be indulge early this week people who riot on january who very much have far right tendency be forgive many of they be radicalise online this year holocaust memorial day theme be to take action for well future that be why be delighted to hear from the minister that education will remain priority if we do not learn the lesson of history we will live they again inter faith work be absolutely vital that be why be proud to have be part of team that set up an inter faith group so that religion can talk to each other not point finger and build bridge not burn they we must also take action against and hold social media firm and publisher to account for far right misinformation end with the word of elie wiesel we must take side neutrality help the oppressor never the victim silence encourage the tormentor never the tormented it be privilege to take part in this debate and to have hear so many poignant contribution number of member have speak about the importance of education which increase yet far as time pass next week have the distinct privilege of attend one of the candle for year event

through event such as candle we keep alive the memory of those who lose their life under nazi persecution on monday will attend holocaust memorial day flag raising ceremony organise by thetford town council in my constituency be pleased that for the first time ever the council will fly the holocaust memorial day flag pay tribute to the mayor of thetford councillor chris harvey it be fitting that the flag be be raise this year during his term as mayor to mark the anniversary as other member have do pay tribute those at the holocaust memorial trust for their work their impact on education over two decade be testament to their dedication and commitment have certainly benefit from their work finally as the minister mention in his opening remark we mark year since holocaust memorial day be create the uk be one of the found signatory to the stockholm declaration on holocaust remembrance in we should all be proud of that alongside other country the uk government be commit to preserve the memory of those who be murder in the holocaust know that member on both side of the house stand by that commitment we should never let it falter or waver call cameron thomas thank you madam deputy speaker we have reach the bottom it be not possible to sink low than this no human condition be more miserable than this nor could it conceivably be so nothing belong to we any more they have take away our clothe our shoe even our hair they will even take away our name and if we want to keep it we will have to find ourselves the strength to do so to manage somehow so that behind the name something of we of we as we be still remain he who lose all often easily lose himself my number be we have be baptize we will carry the tattoo on our left arm until we die prisoner be liberate from auschwitz concentration camp in january one of only survive member of the who have arrive on his transport month early he be liberate strictly in physical sense but remain torture by what he have experience until his death in before his death italian jewish liberal primo levi write extensively about his experience recommend his collection of essay the drowned and the saved as one of the bleakest yet most compelling book have ever read my past visit to dachau and sachsenhausen camp cast long shadow in my memory we be fortunate that those relic of this horror continue to haunt their landscape as foreboding reminder but with the survive voice fade year on year we must guard against the path that lead to auschwitz the holocaust be unique in its industrialisation of genocide nothing so terrible at such scale have happen before nor since we must not delude ourselves that it could not as the hon member for hendon david pinto duschinsky say never again must mean never again and as the hon member for brent east dawn butler say genocide do not occur overnight the black shoot of fascism be intolerance it be then as it be now spread throughout frustrated population appeal to their sense of national identity and stimulate feeling of injustice in this environment nationalism fester and large group be mobilise by divisive populism that validate they as superior but oppress by an imagine elite and undermine by minority in and germany the jews be both the imagine elite and the minority today we see various group demonise include jews muslims and refugee it depend on the source recommend that member read compilation of nazi propaganda the jewish enemy by jeffrey herf those who choose to read it will observe very clearly the parallel between such propaganda then and now it be not coincidence it be learn and it be finesse with the same stereotype the same accusation the same divisive rhetoric and the same risk of follow that same terrible path we must not be fool by those who mislead we who minimise normalise and amplify the action and the rhetoric of division and fascism those who do must be challenge out and comprehensively defeat associate myself with the minister statement that remembrance without resolve be not enough let we honour the memory of those who suffer the holocaust by stand vigil to stave off its repeat too pay tribute to my hon friend the member for hendon david pinto duschinsky for his powerful and move testimony his grandparent would be truly proud as many have say mark year since the liberation of the nazi concentration and death camp and that awful milestone mean that this be likely to be the last landmark anniversary at which significant number of holocaust survivor will be present holocaust memorial day encourage we to remember yes the million jewish man woman and child murder by the nazis and their collaborator during the holocaust but also all those who be persecute by the nazis include the roma the sinti people gay man disabled people political opponent and other we remember too all those affect by subsequent genocide in cambodia rwanda bosnia of which will say more and darfur when it come to remembering elie wiesel the holocaust survivor and scholar who have already be quote by my hon friend the member for high peak jon pearce put it well when he say that whoever listen to witness become witness so those who hear we those who read we must continue to bear witness for we yesterday in portcullis house thank to mr speaker many of we do indeed bear witness as we hear the extremely move testimony of two holocaust survivor yisrael abelesz and alfred garwood we all know many old soldier who quite understandably never recount the trauma they suffer in the war often because they have blank it out and move on however many of those who be not soldier but survivor of genocide have show an extraordinary strength and perseverance to keep tell their story however painful through need to keep their memory alive and they do so again and again their testimony be so direct and so powerful that when we hear they we become part of that remembering process yisrael abelesz now aged be just when he and his family be deport to auschwitz birkenau where his parent david and haya and young brother aaron age just year old be send to the gas chamber on arrival that sense of the history book become all too chillingly real jump out at we yesterday when yisrael say he be greet on arrival at the camp by the infamous angel of death josef mengele he say mengele ask how old be you understand bit of german and say it just my birthday and he reply that very good very good and send to the right side as yisrael say do know it at that time but what he mean be very good you can stay temporarily alive alfred story too should show we all that while hate be immensely destructive there be strength in community he tell we how he be blonde babe in arm carry by his father father who save the life of another inmate in bergen belsen by give they bread across the barbed wire it be so move to hear he recall that after the war his father meet that same fellow camp mate in the east end of london it be move too to hear how alfred become doctor and psychiatrist to help other trauma victim and how he say that hatred even hatred of those who commit the genocide be corrosive force that desire to rid ourselves of hatred be echo by muhammad one of the pupil at falinge park high school in my constituency of rochdale who write this in poem about the holocaust revenge be never sweet it be monster willing to prevail falinge park high school be multicultural school that have legacy beacon status as one of the school under the umbrella of the university college london centre for holocaust education two year ago it host holocaust survivor ike alterman to deliver his testimony yesterday those from the school again attend the greater manchester holocaust commemoration host by andy burnham be delighted that the prime minister have say that it will be national ambition that every schoolchild should hear the record testimony of holocaust survivor and the chancellor announce furth million for holocaust education in the budget as the minister say the holocaust educational trust innovative free digital education programme testimony will allow student to have virtual reality conversation with holocaust survivor long after the survivor themselves be no long with we the prioritisation of holocaust education in our school have be praise across this house today and rightly so but the prevention of holocaust denial can not be leave just to pass law or to education it must be cultural or grassroots change that exist alongside formal education education do not begin and end in our school some child will go back from lesson to home where parent and old sibling fill their head with misinformation and unchecked source from social medium sadly there be now depressingly familiar routine of sharp spike in attack on synagogue or on mosque whenever news break about an atrocity an atrocity that have no personal connection to the people worship inside those building there be well of simmer loathing that lurk unseen and be top up by casual racism that formal education alone can not fix as the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers powerfully remind we mark the anniversary of the genocide in bosnia and the massacre at srebrenica the tragedy be that the story of what happen in srebrenica year ago be not be tell in srebrenica itself the enclave go into serbia as part of the peace deal where deny the massacre be now official policy in and out of school the issue be raise by baroness helic in the other place who be fierce advocate for justice on the massacre srebrenica memorial centre report last year identify prominent public figure involve in denial of the holocaust include republika srpska president milorad dodik and serbian president aleksandar vučić among other last year my former newspaper the report election poster in window in republika srpska with the slogan genocide do happen one billboard praise convict war criminal ratko mladić the bosnian serb military chief know as the butcher of bosnia his crime include the massacre of bosniak muslim man and boy in srebrenica in july the bloodbath be the bad episode of mass murder in europe since the second world war be proud to say that my wife be among the channel news team who expose those horrific war crime genocide do not come out of the blue they depend on what professor david feldman have describe as the reservoir of hate he point out that the danger in the case of antisemitism be not just the virus of antisemitism that capture the minority of antisemite the wide danger be widely diffused reservoir of stereotype and narrative about jews this reservoir have accumulate over century and have become part of our common culture that apply to islamophobia just as it do to antisemitism when weaponise by extremist the legitimate and proud celebration of one community identity curdle into the denigration of another history be use and warp territory and belonging be weaponise into separation and segregation date be cite as battle cry and the cycle perpetuate anger be legitimate emotional response to atrocity but hatred be not peace be hard compromise be painful violence and the prejudice it rely on be easy but everyday racism can be counter only by everyday engagement and disinformation by information the holocaust be the industrialisation of murder but the difference be only one of scale from the many pogrom that jewish community have have to suffer over the century in soho this month the national holocaust centre and museum have devise new touring exhibition call the vicious circle it link five jewish community decimate by violence object be on display to represent co existence and integration into the host country before five particular pogrom berlin in baghdad in kielce in poland in aden in yemen in and of course kibbutz kissufim on october that be history this be the present the well the reservoir be there and it need to be drain end like many other with another quote from elie wiesel much depend on we on our sense of justice and integrity on our dedication to truth on our willingness to share our innermost memory and we survivor have promise that we shall try as the number of survivor dwindle it be on we it be our duty in this place to follow their heroic example and honour their memory every day it be not often in this house that everyone from every party speak with one voice and it be not often that we stand here and do not have political argument and that we all listen nod and agree with all the speaker we be hear the minister who introduce the debate do an excellent job lay out some of the cold hard fact and make clear exactly why we have holocaust memorial day the hon member for hendon david pinto duschinsky bring humanity into that with his own family story and we have hear from member across the house about their personal view the view of holocaust survivor and the reading they have do and about genocide and massacre that have take place not just in the wake of the second world war but more recently it be important that we remember all that it be important that we use the privileged position that we have here and the platform we have in this house we be incredibly lucky that we can stand here and amplify the voice of our constituent right now we have more of responsibility to do that than ever we be see the rise of antisemitism in the wake of what happen on october we be see that on our street the antisemitism policy trust have publish two report about the rise of antisemitism online and the inability of ai system on some website to find antisemitic post urge the government to look at those report particularly when it come to the rise of issue on we be see the rise of islamophobia be see constituent who be refugee and asylum seeker face discrimination and prejudice that have not see in the year have be support and deal with the public it be new it feel like we have tip into different world we be see rise in anti trans anti gay and anti lesbian hate on our street as well now be the point when we all have to take action we all have to recognise that whatever we have be do to try to tackle this whatever voice we have use and whatever moment we have take we have not do enough we be not there yet we have not manage to tackle this whether as group of individual with platform we be capable of sort it out do not matter what matter be that we try every single day to make that difference the hon member for brent east dawn butler and number of hon member have say that holocaust do not happen overnight we do not go from have happy community to mass murder in couple of day we go through stage with rise in hatred and the dehumanisation and othering of people we go through situation like there be in germany after the first world war where the population feel hard do by their life be not as good as they could be and they want someone to blame they have politician the medium and people stand up and say there be people you can blame for this in that case the population be be tell the jews be the people to blame the jewish people be less human than you be and they be to blame for your life be struggle and for you find thing difficult right now we know that that divisive rhetoric be be use around the world right now it be be use here be sure that all hon member have see rise in the number of email to they say can not afford to pay my energy bill and that be because of the number of illegal in this country we all need to stand up against that it be not just about counter the explicit hate that people come up with and the obvious racism and antisemitism that people send we in email it be about counter the people who will say yes but you have to allow we our free speech you have to allow we the freedom to say thing that dehumanise other we must counter that chip away at the hard win right of minority group we need to stand there and say not just you wrong to people behave in racist way and use racist rhetoric but no we will not reduce the right that trans people have we will not reduce the right that gay people have we will not reduce the right that jewish people muslims and people of all faith should have to practise their faith we should make stand for equality and the right that people have as well as against the hatred reduction in those right be how we get to the far end of the road in auschwitz the beginning of the road be reduce right take up sharpie and write that trans people be no long to be recognise and say that people who riot against democracy be fine cool and should carry on many of we be use our platform to say these thing but we be not win we need to tackle disinformation and misinformation online and in person and the diminution of right that people have fight for this be an incredibly poignant debate be proud of all the mp who have stand up and argue against dehumanisation and have relate their experience and those of constituent and survivor we need to do that and not just on holocaust memorial day every one of we need to work for well future every single day there be so many good people out there who care huge amount about this we need to mobilise they and take they with we ensure that we amplify their voice as they speak in favour of the well future that we all want may say how moved have be by

force into cattle truck to auschwitz where he lose most of his family what strike about ivor be how despite everything he have see and endure he retain his capacity for love and his belief in the power of love however be also strike by his sense of pessimism about the future and his feeling that the world today increasingly resemble the world of the be sad to say that share that concern we have see growth across europe of politics that unashamedly demonise minority community and present they as alien in our midst to such degree that people become inured to their plight or ill treatment the holocaust show we where that toxic combination can lead the nazis attempt to rid europe from what they see as an alien presence in their midst do not happen overnight they first have to dehumanise the jews depict they as an alien culture subject they to antisemitic conspiracy theory that they be part of global conspiracy to manipulate global event and strip they of their citizenship right in his recent film occupied city the director steve mcqueen show how that unfold in one city amsterdam where the bulk of the dutch jewish population live his film chronicle the measure the nazis take they sack all jews from public sector job ban they from all public place close down all jewish school force jews to wear special badge to demarcate they from everybody else prevent they from marry non jews subject they to daily humiliation and physical abuse and ultimately round up every jew they could find and deport they to death camp the film chronicle the most tremendous heroism of ordinary dutch people to resist those measure and show solidarity with their jewish neighbour however it also show that antisemitism have take seed in dutch society where year of antisemitic propaganda have rot the foundation of that society and many ordinary people collaborate in the persecution of the jews and betray their neighbour jewish community that number around at the start of the nazi occupation be reduce to by the end of it that picture be repeat in city after city across europe but those word do nothing to capture the sheer terror and horror of what the experience must have be like for the many million of people unfortunate enough to have experience it the generational trauma that it have leave in its wake resonate with every jewish family to this day the holocaust embody the reality of fascism in power unfortunately the idea at the core of fascist ideology racist narrative wrap up in ethno nationalist fantasy be on the rise in germany at present we see the far right alternative für deutschland party with neo nazis in its rank on track to be comfortably the second large party in the german parliament in austria the far right freedom party recently win third of the popular vote with an election pledge to remigrate citizen with migrant heritage similar dynamic be well under way in france italy and other country where the far right have significant electoral foothold these be not fascist party of the classic type but they be walk on that ground when member be sorry to say of this house demonise and talk about deport immigrant and the president of the united states commit to deport million of immigrant family with the rich man in the world cheer he on while give fascist salute it should send shiver down everyone spine there be more than whiff of the in the air holocaust memorial day also pay tribute to the genocide in cambodia rwanda darfur and bosnia we have already hear from the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers and other about the genocide in bosnia that result in the death of man woman and child with murder in the srebrenica massacre wish to mention the other genocide that be commemorate on holocaust memorial day in

rape and displacement in response to an uprising by rebel group the conflict be characterise by ethnic cleansing with hundred of thousand of people kill and million displace unfortunately violence and instability continue in the region there be more recent example such as myanmar as we remember on this anniversary all those affect by the holocaust the bosniaks kill in srebrenica year ago and the victim of the genocide that have just mention we should also remember all those who in their day to day life have suffer atrocity in approximately distinct armed conflict since the end of the second

will work towards that end call the shadow minister it be privilege and an honour as shadow minister but also as the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on british jews to close today debate on holocaust memorial day share the very complimentary observation of many member about the minister opening speech he be very clear in restate the importance not only of recall in particular the holocaust that take place in the second world war target at million jews and people from all kind of minority background but of ensure this have be reflect in the many contribution from member across the chamber that when we debate these issue we think about the lesson we can learn from what happen then from early tragedy and from event since in order to ensure that as far as possible we be do what we can to make sure those kind of event be never repeat there have be many move and impactful speech the hon member for hendon david pinto duschinsky for leicester south shockat adam and for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed and my hon friend the members for harrow east bob blackman and for brigg and immingham martin vickers all make contribution as do every speaker that will try to reflect in my closing speech in particular where the point they make relate to lesson that we need to learn for the future it be incredibly important to hear the testimony of survivor and join colleague in pay tribute to people such as my constituent paul sved he be one of those holocaust survivor who travel the country with the holocaust memorial day trust speak about what he experience as child and the impact it have on he his family and his wide community these be all reminder of the human story that make the level of inhumanity that be show in the holocaust even hard to comprehend it be also an opportunity to reflect that even in the midst of all that darkness there be example of humanity of people in difficult situation take step to preserve the life of their neighbour and sometimes of stranger in their community have the opportunity to visit the wannsee villa beautiful lakeside house on the outskirt of berlin place like my constituency that house be the command centre for the holocaust it be where the committee of nazi politician police and military meet to manage the logistic today it be museum display the record that be keep of all the meeting that take place the thing that find very striking about it as visit politician be the banality of that evidence and those record it be like read the minute of the plan committee that see in local authority they list who attend and what they discuss but instead of record the detail of people extension and change to the design of their home and their neighbour view they record in detail the planning and execution of government level strategy of mass murder that emphasise the importance of learn from history when we see the statue at friedrichstraße station the memorial to the kindertransport we can recall that at the end of world war two when the russian force arrive in berlin they find jewish people live in that city who have be shelter by combination of city authority and neighbour even in those dark place there be those who be willing to help it be important to remember that antisemitism have much old root be very strike by the contribution of the hon member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley who talk about the blood libel in world that often seem very polarised it always seem to great irony that even far back than that the islamic caliphate that rule spain with which much of christian europe be at war for century be the one place of safety in europe for jewish people for very long time antisemitism be something that have deep root and it be incumbent on we to be aware of those root if we be to deal with it effectively member have speak about the need to spot example of similar human behaviour in more recent year srebrenica be describe many member speak movingly of their experience of it and insight from it as the display at mr speaker event yesterday set out what happen in rwanda be one of the most hideous genocide of the modern era many of we will recall see that tragedy unfold on the tv news or hear about it on the radio that tie in with the theme of today debate rwanda be now modern democratic nation work with country across europe and the united nations for example to resettle refugee it be good example of the fact that when terrible thing happen people may not always progress quickly to perfect situation but they can learn identify lesson and seek to make amend as well as an opportunity to recall what happen this debate be an opportunity for we to reflect on what the nation and parliament need to do in policy term it be important to acknowledge for example our nation commitment through our government to the european convention on human right it express fundamental and ancient british value to do with the rule of law and due process and apply to nation many of which choose to enshrine those value because they want to learn from the event that lead up to the holocaust and to ensure that it never happen again there be always scope for debate on whether treaty and convention be fit for the modern age but our nation must continue to work alongside the un and to value international law and agreement from those of the united nations high commissioner for refugees to those of the international maritime organisation that enshrine the rule on how we treat people such as refugee in small boat who find themselves in distress at sea they have bearing on how we work with other country as lead nation and lead voice in the international community to encourage other to share our value of liberty and democracy when we recall as my hon friend the member for harrow east my constituency neighbour do in such historical detail the event lead up to world war two it put into context our debate in the chamber about defence spending we can debate the figure but there be clearly broad commitment to move towards spend of gdp on defence as my hon friend set out however we have commitment to other across europe in that we simply could not meet in practice our country be able to defend itself as the battle of britain show but we should all ask ourselves my hon friend pose this challenge what would have be different if we have learn lesson and act soon would we have be able in small or great measure to prevent the tragedy that unfold and take so many innocent life the united kingdom be not global policeman any more the year of the victorian pax britannica be clearly long go but there remain scope for free nation to work together and many of they have an honourable history in this respect the minister and have talk lot about grenfell tower give our portfolio grenfell be send to deal with the consequence of atrocity in the sudan that cause serious concern across the world in the victorian era british troop british force and british diplomacy be frequently deploy as in benin because of concern about the large scale loss of life and atrocity that be destabilising community look around our modern world we see the russianisation of deported ukrainian child who be take from their family to another country to be change into citizen of different place with different outlook we look at what have happen to the uyghur people and the rohingya and we look at the unfold tragedy in gaza and israel we may not be able to intervene directly and put stop to those thing but the combine force of the international community can be extremely powerful we may not always be able to intervene early enough to prevent the bad of tragedy but we still have the scope to make difference many of we will be conscious of the impact of these issue on our constituent have hear rabbi aaron goldstein at the ark synagogue in my constituency speak about that movingly indeed my hon friend the member for south west hertfordshire mr mohindra join in visit it be twin with synagogue in ukraine and hold service together with people whose home be be bomb and whose synagogue be under attack the holocaust that we be talk about be an historical event but its consequence and the attitude behind it be very much alive not just in europe but elsewhere in the world add the opposition thank to organisation that do incredibly important work on this issue particularly in this era of heighten tension and heighten fear of antisemitism applaud the fact that the government have through cross party work carry on provide the necessary finance to the community security trust which have visible presence around synagogue in my constituency it provide reassurance to our jewish citizen and their friend and neighbour so that they can freely practise their faith and associate with member of their community without fear notwithstanding some of the debate around march in central london welcome the fact that in most of our community relationship remain good in particular relationship that be build up during the covid era when people of all faith come together with church and community organisation have stand we in good stead and people have not allow themselves to be divide thank the metropolitan police and police force across the country who have respond to issue robustly but with sensitivity since there have be not only long stand cross party support for funding for the cst which provide security assistance for synagogue and our jewish community but fund to ensure that our muslim community enjoy additional security and protection all those who have testify about their experience of come here from holocaust blight europe for new start have describe the importance of be in place where freedom apply to everybody and be not the preserve of few it be enormously important that the work of the holocaust memorial day trust and the educational programme that sit alongside it continue so that our child and future generation have the opportunity we have have to hear the testimony of those who have be through those dark period and the opportunity which many member describe so movingly to learn from history and

history that have shape the conscience of humanity the debate have highlight that the past few year have not be easy for british jews with antisemitism on the rise across europe and the uk it have also show that contemporary antisemitism revolve around the holocaust with some blame the holocaust on jews or suggest that jews focus on that tragedy to gain advantage as well as holocaust denial we see the grow use of holocaust distortion as have be point out by hon member and intentional effort to excuse or minimise the impact of the holocaust today holocaust denial and distortion move instantaneously across social medium and be amplify by algorithm that drive anger hate and division as we mark the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz birkenau it be right to be remind of what unchecked behaviour and violent bigotry can lead to we all have duty and role to play in root out antisemitism where we see it and the jewish community can be assure that the government will stand shoulder to shoulder with they the message be clear we can not remember the victim of the holocaust without fight antisemitism and hate today that be why we remain determined to create the uk national

sussex hope the government will pay heed to the strength of feeling across west sussex and my constituency that election should never be cancel opportunistically under the guise of local government reorganisation it lead to the disenfranchisement of voter and further erode trust in politic and politician follow be the full text of the petition the petition of resident of the united kingdom declare that the county council election mean to take place in may should not be postpone indefinitely the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to ensure that the county council elections in west sussex take place in may and the petitioner remain etc high streets autumn budget motion make and question propose that this house do now kitchen it be an honour to secure this debate on the autumn budget impact on high street as my first adjournment debate not just because it be such vital topic but because it be topic dear to my heart in my maiden speech share the story of help my mum on the shop floor and it seem only fitting that my first adjournment debate be on our high street every night after school and most weekend help out in my mum gift shop remember chat away to the staff the customer and our neighbouring business remember late night sort out item to donate to the local charity and the summer when offer to run the shop myself also remember what happen when the economy turn have to pack away stock and move to small premise because it be that or closure remember help my parent with the mortgage as teenager gleefully buy break biscuit as family and only now later in life realise how much work my parent put in to keep roof over our head and food on the table after many successful year during which several premise be open the cost of retail and business rate the competition from online giant and the decline in consumer spending be too much my mum could not beat they so she join they and take her business online in many way it be relief for the family it be simple way of continue the business but it be hard to see the store close year after she first set up shop my hon friend be right about how sad it be to see high street shop close such as the one in which she use to help we have see local council invest in cullompton high street but this be sadly offset by the shop closure will my hon friend make some recommendation on what the government could do to prevent some of these shop closure the heart of this debate be about make sure we look after those business and the many more that could open my story show why this debate be so important to know that the story of our high street be the story of our local community will the hon lady give way will make little progress both for the family behind the door and for the family and local people who shop there our high street be truly at the heart of the community have the honour of represent seven high street across harpenden and berkhamste and be grateful to the local business that respond to my survey ahead of this debate today be share their voice as well as the impact the budget will have on their business their livelihood their family and our community respond to my small business survey local business in street say that high employer national insurance contribution be one of the major challenge and that it could force they to cancel some of their investment plan do my hon friend agree that the measure be propose do not encourage growth and could instead push more high street business to close significantly impact the already fragile rural economy absolutely sadly the desperation that come through in my survey show that lot of business be very worried about their future rise motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now kitchen call on victoria collins to stand so that she can take mr shannon intervention will take the hon gentleman intervention from to my mum and dad have shop in ballywalter and they have shop before that as well so there be history of have shop will take the example of today high street in newtownards national insurance contribution wage theft and attack on shop staff be all issue now be face there do the hon lady agree that the high street need help today like it have never need it before absolutely that be very much in line with the feedback have from business indeed it be with much disappoint that share the impact of the autumn budget on my local business it be no secret that the conservatives leave our economy in mess and many of our business be still reel from that that be exactly why it be important for the government to get this right many of the proposal in the autumn budget will not lead to growth on our high street would like to have faith that labour intend to do the right thing and that these be unintended consequence hope that the government hee some of the warning and take action to mitigate the impact and change course in the word of one director in my constituency it be disaster all plan investment have be cancel expansion plan cancel price will go up on april by at least and we look at way to reduce staff count do my hon friend agree that the high street of tiverton and minehead as well as those of every other constituency in the country will be hurt by this government decision to lower the amount of relief offer to retail hospitality and leisure business from to do she also agree that they should instead be look to replace business rate with an entirely new commercial landowner levy rather than tinker around the edge and make an already bad system bad that be one of the main topic that come up business share with that after face the impact of brexit closure during covid cut to local infrastructure follow conservative cut to local government and the soar cost from the cost of living crisis the combination of measure in the autumn budget which include the rise in national insurance contribution the change in business rate that be just mention and the increase in the minimum wage as well as propose change that could impact family business mean that they be now reach crisis point business that speak to be largely supportive of an increase in the minimum wage want to highlight that because they want to support their staff however it be the combination of all those factor after such difficult time that be devastating the knock on impact of that combination have also see pre emptive cost rise across supply chain and worry about consumer confidence as consumer ultimately spend less on our high street although the gfk consumer confidence index in the uk rise by one point last december confidence level remain subdued and retail sale in the uk unexpectedly decline month on month last december in moment in the calendar that be often the most critical time for retail and hospitality on our high street come back to national insurance contribution for employer this be pre profit cost increase not only do that need to be manage but for business that be just about break even or make loss it will tip they over the edge and drastically cut the cash flow that be often key to investment the well love local lussmans restaurant in hertfordshire have be serve local people for year and face around off the bottom line lead to reduce investment in our local area temptation gift will see similar if not high cost and say that for the first time in year it will be shorten opening hour as part of its cost save measure it be have to make difficult staffing decision in business that the family have build over decade my constituent charlotte manage director of the old family run jeweller in the uk say that the mix of high national insurance contribution and high minimum wage cost mean that they will not hire any more staff and that anyone who leave will not be replace almar in tring where carolyn and her husband already work long day say that the national insurance contribution will be big issue in their running cost and that they do not know how they will cope work even long day chiltern opticians in tring highlight the barrier that small business face in hire staff it say that it be very different for big corporation which have large human resource team to handle staffing issue and that we just do have the budget for it these be resilient business or they have be and they want to continue to build those business and to employ local people indeed see their pride in support local staff often call they family jordan from grace son in tring say we be more like community centre at time provide essential service to the community in that hear my mum voice who so often do the same our pub restaurant and cafés in harpenden and berkhamste cover hospitality venue that employ more than people and generate nearly million in revenue these business be the backbone of our economy and community the government say that they be protect small business but these be the small business of which they talk indeed the official definition of small or medium sized enterprise be company with few than employee they be grow local often family run business that be nowhere close to be the international giant that have start to dominate retail or hospitality these local business be happy to pay their way andrei say have no issue with tax rise but these be position poorly the vast majority of the high street be sme and they will be hit the hard sadly the desperation be clear these small business be worried that the budget will be the final straw participant in my local survey say what be the point of small business the high street be die therefore when it come to national insurance contribution will the government consider mitigation to support the local business on our high street these could include low rate of nic for earning of between and the threshold or low rate for low earn taxpayer who work part time perhaps few than hour per week as we have hear from many local business this would help get more people work and support our local economy at the very least will the government consider delay implementation to give business time to adjust and consider their own mitigation wonder whether the minister will consider what be about to say have be ask to go to the isle of skye on saturday for crisis meeting there be group of hotel which be family run business not big multinational and they face an awful combination of increase across the board include heating price increase their no issue be national insurance contribution and minimum wage cost they think that on average their cost will go up by between and they be in very poor state indeed can the minister give any encouragement that could pass on to they on her behalf mr macdonald your intervention be on the member so the question go to she and she can insist on the minister respond my hon friend mention the rise in energy cost which have not cover in my speech but which have be mention by many of my local business as matter for consideration be sure the minister will also consider the other comment that he make when it come to business rate there be similar story of despair the robin hood pub say that its business rate will double grace son say our business rate be already huge cost overall to the business which seem disproportionate give that our premise be relatively small and increase they will put even more strain on our already stretch budget mark from tabure restaurant in both harpenden and berkhamsted say there will be yet another increase in the national minimum wage this time above inflation alcohol duty will increase on february business rate be set to increase in april along with various increase in national insurance contribution and this budget be devastating will the government consider abolish the break business rate system and replace it with commercial landowner levy furthermore will the government consider deliver the maximum discount allow by the budget to support hospitality or small high street business wish that have the time to dive into all the issue raise by local business but will focus on just two more many be worried about high street service such as parking with the conservatives have cut local council funding again and again many service such as parking and investment in our high street have have to be cut as well give the government commitment to local community will they ensure that investment in local council compensate for the increase in national insurance contribution that council will have to pay to help they to invest in our high street and relate service several family business have highlight the devastating impact of the propose change to inheritance tax mike and his wife have work week in week out for over year and in their be still work full time to support the business and their employee they say that they have take low dividend and look after their staff and hope to hand over the business to their child but the propose change mean that the business may have to be pull apart for charlotte family business the removal of the business property relief will mean that it will not be able to stay in the building that it have be in for two century will the government carry out proper impact assessment on inheritance tax for family business notably where the asset will stay within business that support the local community once again thank all the business that contact be sorry that could not mention they all similar issue be highlight by local charity healthcare provider and indeed business beyond the high street in harpenden berkhamste tring redbourn flamstead markyate and potten end suggest that the minister meet or continue to meet with such business up and down the country carolyn from almar have invite the chancellor to come and see at first hand the challenge of run high street shop and plead with the government to look at measure to mitigate the impact and help our high street to thrive will end with message of hope would like to envisage day when people can head to their local high street in harpenden tring redbourn or anywhere in the uk when there be proper public transport investment so it be easy to pop on the bus when there be investment in our walkway and cycleway so people can get down there easily and when people can perhaps even find parking space day when the high street be vibrant place full of thrive local business when people can drop their kid off nearby at the local creche easily head to the doctor and relax with friend and family after busy or sunny day that is when the sun come out in the uk day when our high street up and down the country be real experience when they have be invest in and local business be thrive and when the beat heart of our community be alive thriving and no long on life support with the right investment and incentive and with adjustment to the autumn budget we must start that journey congratulate the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins on secure the debate and thank she for share her story of work in her mum gift shop it be very move to hear that she have have direct experience of work in shop on the high street also thank she for her survey of local small business on her seven high street which be an impressive number she outline very well the importance of the business there think she say that there be retail hospitality and leisure business employ some people thank she for share those statistic and the feedback from those business share the hon member passion for the regeneration of our high street think it be concern for member across the house high street be focal point of economic activity but most importantly she say this in her speech they be often key part of the unique character of our community we know that high street business be contend with range of challenge she list some of they but will list couple change consumer shopping habit and the rise of online shopping and series of economic headwind include the pandemic which we know be particularly difficult for small independent business on the high street the government be commit to reform britain economy to bring about decade of national renewal create an environment in which our high street be able to flourish be critical to that commitment in her speech the hon member recognise the government dire economic inheritance from the conservatives none of whom be in the chamber we have some very difficult decision to make in the budget but it be necessary to wipe the slate clean to deliver the economic stability that high street business need will the minister say why taxis be put on poor struggle organisation such as high street shop and hotel rather than the massive online business that be empty our high street why do she not consider impose high rate of corporation tax or income tax rather than hit the poor business in our society the hon member pre empt my next sentence so thank he for that we have commit to reform business rate because we need fair system fit for the century that important part of our reform and plan will hope benefit the business that the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted speak about in recent week have be work with an excellent organisation call family business uk before christmas it do some research on the impact of agricultural property relief and business property relief on family business and it be about to do another round of research do the minister official want to avail themselves of the result of that research so that they have well context minister be always happy to hear from hon member suggest that the hon member write to the exchequer secretary to the treasury with that feedback should note that this be not my policy area the exchequer secretary be visit small business as we speak so be stand in for he but be sure that he will welcome that feedback from the hon lady have listen carefully to the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted and try to note down all her question but if do not get to all of they be happy to write to she after the debate hope that be helpful she ask whether there be any mitigation and think she ask we to cancel some of the plan in the budget be afraid that can not give she that assurance the change to national insurance will come into force on april as say we have to make difficult decision and that be one of the most difficult the hon member ask whether we be meet small business the exchequer secretary be meet range of small business as be treasury official before formulate our plan to reform business rate which will talk about briefly she ask question about inheritance tax will write to she on that to ensure she get the right answer she also ask about local government be not entirely sure about the question so perhaps we can clarify that and will write to she on that as well turn in more detail to the hon member point about national insurance one of the tough decision we take in the budget be to raise the rate of employer national insurance contribution from to but we recognise the need to protect the small business the federation of small businesses ask we specifically about that which be why we have more than double the employment allowance to that mean that more than half of business with national insurance contribution liability will either see no change at all or be take out of pay national insurance contribution as say that be key demand from small business to support business include those on the high street the budget honour the manifesto commitment to not raise corporation tax it set out the tax road map for this parliament in which we will not change corporation tax which mean we have the low rate in the all that will support business from restaurant to retailer to invest on the high street we announce at the budget major support for pub we be cut alcohol duty on qualify draught product which make up approximately of the alcoholic drink sell in pub that represent an overall reduction in duty bill of over million year and be equivalent to duty reduction on typical pint the hon member raise concern about the business rate system let address those in more detail we very much believe that for too long the business rate system have place an unfair burden on high street retail hospitality and leisure business as she mention to support those sector we intend to introduce permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure property with rateable value of less than from that will allow we to provide stability after the ongoing uncertainty of the one year retail and hospitality leisure relief which have be extend year by year since the pandemic that tax cut will be sustainably fund not by increase in taxis on work people which we promise not to introduce but through high tax rate on the most valuable of business property in the country that will capture the majority of large distribution warehouse include those use by online giant as well as other out of town business that draw footfall away from high street those business rate reform provide the certainty that business need to invest while protect the public finance the government have already introduce to the house primary legislation that will provide the underpinning of those reform and the exact rate for the new multiplier will be confirm later this year in the autumn budget many rural town centre in glastonbury and somerton and the business within they be really worried about business rate will the minister consider implement fundamental business rate overhaul for small business in rural area we need to treat all small business equally understand the hon lady perspective but do not think that it would be fair or easy to have business rate system that distinguish between rural and non rural what be rural know the constituency of the hon member for harpenden and berkhamste rather well because live not too far away tring be town there but other place in her constituency would be quite difficult to categorise as rural or non rural so do not think that we can go down that route although understand why the hon member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke be try to tempt we down it do not think that would work the minister talk about business rate and mention tring in hertfordshire problem that lot of local business have mention be that the rateable value be high because property cost be high even if what they sell be of low value the difficulty be that they be pay lot when they might not have high turnover will the government consider mitigation for those run business in area with high property cost be here in my ministerial capacity of course but also represent high wycombe in the south east so understand her point and promise to take it back to the department and to the exchequer secretary to the treasury level the play field for the high street be just the start and we be commit to transform the whole system in the long term as we set out in the transforming business rates policy paper that we publish alongside the budget the government will create fairer business rate system that protect the high street support investment and be fit for the century it be important that we work in partnership with high street business to get the reform right thank the hon member for harpenden and berkhamste for bring the voice of small business in her constituency to our proceeding government official have undertake series of roundtable event to understand from business across all sector and size how they think reform of the system can well be deliver over business have already give their feedback at those roundtable the exchequer secretary to the treasury be lead that work and engage with broad range of high street business as be official in my department appreciate that it be perhaps the exchequer secretary who would know this but will the government make sure that the reform of business rate that they be propose be not negative for those small business with very small rateable value that do not currently pay business rate at all indeed the point of the reform be to well protect small business as the hon gentleman say there be already small business that be protect but we want to ensure that those small business that be above the current threshold be also protect and do not pay the rate that they pay at the moment we want to make sure that small business on the high street be well support that be the whole point of the reform so can reassure he that it will not get bad for small business it may be the exchequer secretary area but know that much so thank the hon gentleman for the opportunity to respond to that question we look forward to further engagement with business over the come month on deliver business rate system fit for the future congratulate the hon member for harpenden and berkhamste again on her first adjournment debate in the house it be also the first adjournment debate that have respond to as minister and thank she for raise this important issue this government have deliver the economic stability that high street business need to thrive and we be commit to deliver the business rate reform that will support high street up and down the country question put and agree to house adjourn
