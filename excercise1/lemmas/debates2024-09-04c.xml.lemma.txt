challenge circumstance they serve our community commendably and keep we all safe government be about make choice and the new prime minister have make choice he have choose to take the winter fuel allowance away from low income pensioner and give that money to certain unionised workforce in inflation bust pay rise could ask the prime minister why do he choose train driver over britain vulnerable pensioner this government be elect to clear up the mess leave by the conservative party and to bring about the change that the country desperately need our first job be to audit the book and what we find be billion black hole it be no good their complaining richard hughes the chair of the office for budget responsibility be very clear he describe it as one of the large year ahead overspend against forecast outside of the pandemic those be his word we have have to take tough decision to stabilise the economy and repair the damage include target winter fuel payment while protect pensioner some pensioner be not take up pension credit and we intend to turn that around we will align housing benefit and pension credit something the previous government defer year after year and because of our commitment to the triple lock pension be project to increase by over in the next five year the prime minister also inherit inflation back at target interest rate be cut low unemployment and indeed the fast grow economy in the but that be not the point because the prime minister now have to start take responsibility for his own decision if as he say the public finance be priority it be his decision and his alone to award train driver on pay rise of almost and it be also his decision that pensioner live on just will have their winter fuel allowance remove can the prime minister explain to britain low income pensioner why he have take money away from they while at the same time give more money to highly pay train driver we spend the whole election with the right hon gentleman try to tell the country that everything be fine and this be the result the conservatives get massive labour mandate to change the country if he carry on pretend everything be fine for ordinary people across the country his party will be in opposition for very long time remind he that we inherit absolute chaos from the conservatives we lose an average of million working day year to strike under his watch you can not fix the economy if the train do not work and you can not fix the economy if the nhs be not work when it come to winter fuel payment the conservatives be have competition as understand they will be vote later on today from the shadow housing minister the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch we find this she be the favourite think and some conservative members will probably be vote for she this afternoon she say have people in my constituency tell that they do need the winter fuel payment why do we not have more sophisticated mechanism for means testing she be the favourite think in the contest the conservatives be have the prime minister talk about the public finance the uk public finance be more robust than those of almost any other major advanced economy here we have it he inherit low deficit than france america order when point at someone to be quiet mean it do not need reaction back like that the uk currently have low deficit than france america italy and japan it have the second low debt in the entire the prime minister oppose every difficult decision that we take to deliver that so certainly be not go to take any lecture from he on that score he talk about protect ordinary people last year under the conservative government low income pensioner with just receive not only the winter fuel payment but hundred of pound of additional cost of live support both of which he have now scrap age uk have say that cut the winter fuel allowance be the wrong policy and only this morning we have learn that the vast majority of the poor pensioner pensioner in poverty will see that vital support remove can the prime minister tell the house very specifically and the pensioner who be watch how much less support pensioner on will receive this winter the right hon gentleman talk about tough decision it be tough to inherit billion black hole which the obr do that be the inheritance that be what the conservatives leave back when they be in government they would pretend that it be not there they would have walk past it and put it in the long grass we be not go to do that because we be elect to change this country for the well and stabilise our economy no prime minister want to do what we have to do in relation to the winter fuel allowance but we have to take the tough decision to stabilise our economy to ensure that we can grow it for the future as have say we be work hard on pension credit we be align it with housing benefit which they do not do for year and over five year it have project increase of up to for those on pension tough decision that they duck the government do not have to choose to take money off low income pensioner in order to give it to highly pay train driver that be choice that the prime minister have make and it will be clear to any pensioner watch that he simply can not explain why he have make that choice turn to another important issue the government have suspend of the uk arm export licence to israel it be decision that the chief rabbi say beggar belief and will encourage our share enemy can the prime minister therefore explain how his decision will help to secure the release of the hostage still be hold by hamas may start by say that think the whole house will be shock by the horrific killing of six hostage in the last few day know that speak for the whole house when say that the remain hostage must be release and we need ceasefire to ensure that that can happen that desperately need aid can get into the region and that we can begin the path to two state solution the right hon gentleman ask how we arrive at this decision he know very well because the legal framework be clear the late guidance be issue in under his government and that mean that licence have to be keep under review as they be by his government think he probably know the advice that be give to his government he understand the framework we have carry out the review in the same way and come to clear legal conclusion and share that conclusion and assessment with parliament we will of course continue to stand by israel right to self defence but it be important that we be country commit to the international rule of law that give we the strength of argument in discussion with our ally on important issue this be difficult issue recognise that but it be legal decision not policy decision the leader of the opposition know the the conservatives shout but they issue the guidance and they know what the test be that test have be assess we have come to conclusion and we have put that before the house for it to consider appreciate the prime minister answer but he will know that decision like this also have important and broad geopolitical implication he mention ally it be essential that we maintain transatlantic unity in the face of terrorist threat and avoid any perception of split between our two nation can he therefore update the house or tell it what engagement he have with the united states prior to take this significant decision acknowledge the importance of work with our ally on all issue as we have be do as be able to make very clear at the nato summit that attend in the early summer of course as the right hon gentleman and the house would expect we have talk this through with our ally they understand they have different legal system that be the point they make interruption the shadow foreign secretary chunter this be serious issue and it require serious consideration the leader of the opposition know the legal framework very well he also know that apply the framework the fact of that framework and arrive at decision do not permit to simply say be not go to implement the legal decision or conclusion that have be reach do not think he be really invite to do that these decision have not only geopolitical consequence but emotional one the prime minister take that action on the very same day as the funeral of israeli hostage murder by hamas something that the board of deputies of british jews describe as terrible terrible message to be send hope the prime minister understand the hurt that have be cause will he take this opportunity to reassure israel and the jewish community that the united kingdom and this house stand behind israel and its right to self defence let be very clear as have say before and say again we recognise and support israel right of self defence and we have take action in support of that right of self defence have make that repeatedly clear in all my engagement with israel across the region and with all our ally stand by that in relation to licence this be not an israel issue it be the framework for all licence that must be keep under review it be the same test for all licence as the prime minister know and we have apply the law to the fact and come to legal conclusion do not think the prime do not think the leader of the opposition be really invite to put that to one side this be serious issue we either comply with international law or we do not we have strength in our argument only because we comply with international law appreciate that the conservative party do not think that international law matter and that be why we get into the pickle that we do welcome the home office decision to close the bibby stockholm barge in my constituency we all know that barge be gimmick first it arrive late secondly it cost the taxpayer fortune third it be laden with fire and disease risk and fourthly it likely contribute to the death of year old asylum seeker on board will the prime minister reassure my constituent that this and similar unworkable gimmick will be close down as we clear up the conservative party mess unlike the conservative party we will not waste money on gimmick that be why within day we end the rwanda scheme and announce the launch of the border security force and we have be prepare legislation to introduce counter terrorism power to tackle gang in the first two month we have remove on plane more than people who have no right to be here compare that with the four volunteer send to rwanda which cost million this be government of service not government of gimmick we come to the leader of the liberal democrats echo the prime minister word about the terrible tragedy at grenfell welcome the inquiry and look forward to discuss the statement shortly for the past year norman have be full time carer for his wife ros who have multiple sclerosis and alzheimer disease early this year he be force to go back to work to earn the extra money for the cost of care for his wife as their income be just few hundred pound above the limit for pension credit they be set to lose their winter fuel allowance unless the prime minister listen to the liberal democrats and other and change that plan if he do not what advice do he have for norman and ros and million of struggle pensioner as they face rise heating bill this winter thank the right hon member for raise that important point know how much he have champion carer both politically and personally we have take difficult decision do not pretend it be not difficult of course it be because we have to stabilise the economy the first thing that the chancellor do be an audit she find billion worth of unfunded spending commitment we can not walk past that we can not pretend that it do not exist that be what the last government do we have to take tough decision we will put in all the support that we can and will talk to the right hon gentleman about it but we have to take the tough decision on this the conservatives walk away from those decision and that be what get we into this mess in the first place we can not grow and fix our economy unless we stabilise it first we recognise the appalling financial problem leave to the prime minister by the last conservative government but no one understand the difficult decision require to balance the book as much as unpaid family carer such as norman many million of pensioner have struggle over recent year thank to the last government the number who can not afford to heat their home have double since so will the prime minister support our campaign for more urgent action to invest in insulation and renewable so that we can help pensioner and all family make it cheap to heat their home every winter yes of course remind the right hon gentleman that pensioner be not claim pension credit which of course then deal with the winter fuel payment that be why we be take so much care to ensure we get those pensioner on to pension credit again align housing benefit with pension credit something that the last government leave undo for year will make massive difference and of course there be the triple lock which over five year will mean that pension be expect to rise by up to four year ago the previous government order review into the hormone pregnancy test drug primodos and find that it have cause avoidable harm primodo be give to woman in the and and result in many baby be bear with severe disability for the past year have stand in this parliament and plead repeatedly with the last government to do the right thing will the prime minister commit to fresh approach on this issue and will he meet with and the campaigner marie lyon to discuss how we can give closure to the family who have be deny justice for the past year thank my hon friend for that

the health minister meet my hon friend to discuss this matter far thank the prime minister for visit northern ireland within the past fortnight and particularly for the time he spend with injure officer of the police service of northern ireland he will know of their courage but he will also know of the dog determination of our chief constable jon boutcher in his desire to see adequate resourcing for his officer who not only stand for law and order in northern ireland but stand in the face of racism violence and an ongoing national security threat from dissident republican may therefore ask the prime minister to earnestly and urgently engage in discussion about uplift the national security grant afford to the police service of northern ireland and to ensure that the psni can face the challenge that we need they to face head on thank the right hon gentleman for that question it be important for to go to belfast to meet the injure officer and simply to say thank you for what they be do and of course to recognise the impact on their family recognise the difficult financial position that the psni face and the chief constable and have speak about this issue on more than one occasion as member would expect predominantly it be for the justice minister and the executive to set the psni budget and how the chief constable allocate that budget be an operational matter for he but have be talk to he about what further support might be possible because realise just how important it be to he to the psni and to northern ireland more generally last week ticket sell website

the oil and gas sector we be committed to the necessary transition to renewable energy which will lead to cheap energy energy independence and the job of the future but let be clear oil and gas will play their part for many year to come and that be why have be clear about the support that we have for they be sure the hon member and other will want to celebrate the fact that just this week contract for difference secure record new clean energy project enough to power million home and they be the job of the future the prime minister will remember visit my constituency in june when we tour germany beck fantastic development of new home but because of tory dither and delay it take the good part of decade for that site to get through planning opposition members can grumble all they

the bad tory government in modern time the good this prime minister can offer the british people be thing can only get bad for he and his calamitous opinion rating that be probably true but why do he think he have such an unprecedented fall in his popularity be it his attack on the pensioner be it leave child in poverty be it the re emergence of labour cronyism or be it because his austerity be even bad than the conservative variety remember when scottish national party members use to sit at the front but they be now long way up and there be very few of they so do not think we need lecture on popularity and win election welcome this week news of the change that the government plan on ofsted include the removal of single word judgment this be great news for headteacher in west lancashire

decision have be take because of the billion black hole so responsibility for the decision lie with the party that break the economy there be reason we have mandate for change and reason why

valley in westmorland in our community we be naturally deeply concerned that the vital northern trans pennine project which would make the road considerably safe have be put under review by this government will the prime minister take the opportunity now to end the uncertainty today commit to this project and save life thank the hon gentleman for raise this question about fatality on road which be very serious issue on the and other road across the country we have inherit broken economy and we have to review what we be spend money on we be go through that review and we will report back as soon as we can will the prime minister join in send condolence to the family of jahziah coke year old boy who be stab and tragically kill in my constituency do he share my concern about the prevalence of young people carry knife what more can be do to end this scourge that be destroy family and community be sure speak for the whole house in say that our thought be with jahziah family at

everybody across the house in light of this and so many other tragic case to join with we on that mission rise final question those of we from staffordshire moorlands be immensely proud of our beautiful area and unique identity can the prime minister guarantee that we will not be force into devolution deal or local government reorganisation against our will it be very important that local people have say but it be equally important that we devolve to those who have skin in the game one of the way in which we can restart our economy be by make sure that those with skin in the game take the decision that be relevant to they and their area grenfell tower inquiry phase report this morning sir martin moore bick publish the final report of the grenfell tower inquiry be sure the whole house will join in thank he the member of the inquiry and the whole team for their dedicated work want to speak directly to the bereaved family the survivor and those in the immediate grenfell community some of whom be with we in the gallery today sir martin conclude this morning be afraid that there be no way of repeat this that will not be painful that the simple truth be that the death that occur be all avoidable and that those who live in the tower be badly fail over number of year and in number of different way by as the report lay out in full just about every institution responsible for ensure their safety in the face of an injustice so painful and so deserving of anger word can begin to lose their meaning after seven year still wait for the justice that you deserve want to say very clearly on behalf of the country that you have be let down so badly before during and in the aftermath of this tragedy while sir martin set out catalogue of appal industry failure for which there must now be full accountability he also find decade of failure by central government he conclude in the year between the fire at knowsley heights in and the fire at grenfell tower in there be many opportunity for the government to identify the risk pose by the use of combustible cladding panel and insulation by the department be well aware of those risk but fail to act on what it know far he find the department itself be poorly run and the government deregulatory agenda dominate the department think to such an extent that even matter affect the safety of life be ignore delay or disregarded so want to start with an apology on behalf of the british state to each and every one of you and indeed to all the family affect by this tragedy it should never have happen the country fail to discharge its most fundamental duty to protect you and your loved one the people we be here to serve and be deeply sorry also want to express my admiration for the strength it must have take to relive those event when give your evidence to the inquiry and indeed to see write down today the circumstance that lead to the death of your love one after all that you have be through you may feel that you be always one step away from another betrayal get that and know that can not change that with just word today but what can say be that listen carefully to one of the member of the inquiry ali akbor this morning he say this what be need be for those with responsibility for build safety to reflect and to treat grenfell as touchstone in all that they do in the future consider myself someone responsible for build safety and that be exactly what will do and what will demand of this government today be long await day of truth it must now lead to day of justice justice for the victim and the family of grenfell but also moment to reflect on the state of social justice in our country and chance for this government of service to turn the page that be because this tragedy pose fundamental question about the kind of country we be country where the voice of working class people and those of colour have be repeatedly ignore and dismiss country where tenant of social housing block in one of the rich part of the land be treat like second class citizen shamefully dismiss in the word of one survivor as people with need and problem and not respect as citizen as people who contribute to britain who be part of britain and who belong in britain unbelievably that continue even after the tragedy sir martin highlight certain aspect of the response demonstrate marked lack of respect for human decency and dignity and leave many of those immediately affect feeling abandon by authority and utterly helpless that alone should make anyone who feel any affinity towards justice bristle with anger sir martin continue that he find systematic dishonesty on the part of those who make and sell the rainscreen cladding panel and insulation product he go on to say they engage in deliberate and sustained strategy to manipulate the testing process misrepresent test datum and mislead the market sir martin also cite complete failure on the part of the labc the local authority building control over number of year to take basic step to ensure that the certificate it issue be technically accurate he find that the work of the building research establishment be mar by unprofessional conduct inadequate practice lack of effective oversight poor reporting and lack of scientific rigour and that the tenant management organisation must bear share of the blame its only fire safety assessor have misrepresent his experience and qualification some of which he have invent and be ill qualified to carry out fire risk assessment on building of the size and complexity of grenfell tower he also find chronic lack of effective management and leadership on behalf of the london fire brigade with tragic consequence on the night of the fire in the light of such finding it be imperative that there be full accountability include through the criminal justice process and that this happen as swiftly as possible can tell the house today that this government will write to all company find by the inquiry to have be part of these horrific failing as the first step to stop they be award government contract we will of course support the metropolitan police and the prosecutor as they complete their investigation but it be vital that as we respond to this report today we do not do or say anything that could compromise any future prosecution because the great injustice of all would be for the victim and all those affect not to get the justice that they deserve there must also be more radical action to stop something like this from ever happen again one of the most extraordinary quality of the grenfell community be their determination to look forward they be fight not only for justice for themselves but to ensure that no other community suffer as they have do some important reform have take place in the last seven year which we support in opposition include ban combustible cladding new oversight of building control new safety regime for all residential building over metre new legal requirement on social landlord and make sure that fire and rescue service be train and equip to handle large scale incident include move from stay put to get out when need we be now address the recommendation from sir martin first report to introduce new residential personal emergency evacuation plan policy for anyone whose ability to evacuate could be compromise with funding for those renting in social housing we will look at all of sir martin recommendation in detail there will be debate on the floor of this house we will respond in full to the inquiry recommendation within six month and we will update parliament annually on our progress against every commitment we make but there be some thing can say right now there be still building today with unsafe cladding the speed at which this be be address be far far too slow we only have to look at the fire in dagenham last week building that be still in the process of have its cladding remove this must be moment of change we will take the necessary step to speed this up we will be willing to force freeholder to assess their building and enter remediation scheme within set timescale with legal requirement to force action if that be what it take we will set out further step on remediation this autumn we will also reform the construction product industry that make this fatal cladding so home be make of safe material and those who compromise that safety will face the consequence we will ensure that tenant and their leaseholder can never again be ignore and that social landlord be hold to account for the decency and safety of their home as the government tackle the most acute housing crisis in live memory build million new home across the country we will ensure those home be safe secure and build to the high standard place of security health and wellbeing that serve the need of resident and their wide community because safe and decent home be human right and basic expectation and the provision of that right should never be undermine by the reckless pursuit of greed one of the tragedy of grenfell be that this be community that nurture so much of what we want from housing people who have make the tower their home and be entitle to place of safety and security not deathtrap and yet time and again they be ignore two week ago make private visit to grenfell tower lay wreath at the memorial wall and affirm the government commitment to the work of the memorial commission deliver permanent memorial on the site through process lead by the grenfell community as walk down that narrow staircase from the floor and look at wall burn by degree heat get just sense of how utterly utterly terrify it must have be as see example of the cladding on the outside of the building and listen to description of the catastrophic and completely avoidable failure of that fatal refurbishment feel just sense of the anger that now rise through that building it leave with profound and very personal determination to make the legacy of grenfell tower one of the define change to our country that want to make as prime minister to the family the survivor and the immediate community we will support you now and always especially those who be child in the memory of your love one we will deliver generational shift in the safety and quality of housing for everyone in this country in the memory of grenfell we will change our country not just change in policy and regulation although that must of course take place but profound shift in culture and behaviour rebalancing of power that give voice and respect to every citizen whoever they be and wherever they live we will bring the full power of government to bear on this task because that be the responsibility of service and the duty we owe to the memory of every one of the in that spirit commend this statement to the house call the leader of the opposition thank the prime minister for advance sight of the statement especially give the timing of prime minister question time associate myself and everyone on this side of the house with the prime minister powerful word regard the pain of the bereaved family survivor and all those affect the tragic event surround grenfell tower many be with we today in the gallery and want to pay tribute to their strength and patience in wait for this moment it be not hyperbole to say that we would not be here today without they it be their tenacity and strength that bring the truth to light for that they deserve our thank their search for truth and justice be noble one and have our full support while the grenfell community loss will have leave hole that nothing will ever be able to fill hope that whatever healing be possible from today each and every one of they take some small measure of it know they will never forget the people who tragically lose their life and nor shall we today publication as the prime minister say be to put it bluntly damn indictment of over year of successive state failure stretch as far back as knowsley heights in and then multiple incident from there sir martin moore bick and the work of the inquiry have paint picture of systemic indifference failure and in some notable case dishonesty and greed sir martin and the team work on the inquiry be to be commend for the depth and rigour of their work while such comprehensive report as have be publish today deserve to be consider in full and welcome the prime minister commitment for time in the house to do that there be some immediate point that feel will command support across the house and that will address to the prime minister first the work to remediate and where possible identify new at risk building must continue if we be to meet as be confident the whole house would agree the former right hon member for maidenhead pledge that no such tragedy could occur again know that task be not simple one and thank the prime minister for recognise the importance of this issue significant barrier to make progress quick be financial liability that be an issue be all too aware of when become chancellor and why one of the first major spending decision make be the creation of new billion fund to pay for remediation work in public and private building affect by material beyond dangerous acm cladding the previous government clad safety scheme have ensure an additional billion be available to support remediation work come from combination of developer contribution and building safety levy ask the prime minister and the chancellor to give due consideration to any further request especially with the upcoming fiscal event towards the end of october the second point be confident the prime minister would agree on be the need to maintain and update our legal and regulatory framework to keep pace with change in material construction and supply the last parliament pass the fire safety act and the building safety act acknowledge as the prime minister say that he work constructively with the then government to deliver those improvement these piece of legislation comprehensively reform our fire safety and building regulation regime and ensure that new building safety regulator locate in the health and safety executive be create but also know that these be step stone towards fire and building safety regime that remain persistently fit for purpose in particular urge the prime minister to give special attention to the recommendation in today report especially its call for more regular updating of approve document single regulator sole secretary of state responsible to end the fragmentation of whitehall responsibility and new chief construction adviser want the prime minister to know that should he deem that further legislation be require to support proportionate and necessary measure to protect the public while protect leaseholder from excessive cost we will work collegiately with he to deliver that thirdly ally to the need for continue improvement in the legal and regulatory framework the report also shin light on the significant failure of oversight those responsible for ensure the independence and rigour of testing and compliance be find by this report to have have those very thing compromise in particular the bre in its work with supplier in part enable what sir martin moore bick report have plainly describe as systematically dishonest behaviour on the part of supplier so welcome the prime minister commitment to continue to support the metropolitan police and the crown prosecution service in pursue any appropriate criminal charge against small number of developer and contractor who knowingly and fraudulently cut corner on build safety for greed and financial gain do not want to let this moment pass without also acknowledge the local failure today report highlight whether from the tenant management organisation responsible for the building itself which allow relationship with those live in grenfell tower to become so broken that tenant be marginalise and at worst ignore the repeat fire safety report that be not act on the lack of effective management and leadership at london fire brigade or the local council which have lack of adequate oversight into the management and maintenance of the building and the care and concern of those live in it there will be further lesson to learn from this inquiry there will be difficult question for all those responsible act over long period of time know the prime minister will agree that we must approach those question with the honesty and directness they deserve let conclude at the time the former right hon member for maidenhead apologise to the victim for what she describe as failure at local and national level in response to the fire share in those same word still think today however demand more as prime minister current or former you be custodian of the state its failure whether on your watch or not be something that you feel deeply to that end want to extend my deep apology to the family and victim of the grenfell tower tragedy the state let you down and it must never do so again the mission to ensure that no such tragedy can ever happen again be one that know the whole house support but more than that it be part of legacy that we must create and maintain so that our action meet the full meaning of our word thank the leader of the opposition for the tone and substance of his response we do owe it to the victim their family and the community to work together to ensure that they get the justice they deserve and that we make this turning point that mean this will never happen again there will be debate in which the whole house can participate because although hon member have an opportunity to ask question today they will also want to make substantive contribution on this tragic issue and no doubt on issue of concern in their own constituency relate to cladding and fire safety so we will ensure that time be available welcome the right hon gentleman approach to work jointly as we be able to do ourselves when we be in opposition in particular the remediation work be behind schedule and need to speed up and we must do all we can in that regard financial liability be obviously an issue and we will look into the sufficiency of that as for the legal and regulatory framework obviously change have already be make but think further change will be necessary and we will share those with the opposition as soon as we have some realistic proposal to put before the house if we can then join together in pass the necessary legislation as quickly as possible it will be mark of our determination to treat this as turning point agree with the right hon gentleman comment on criminal proceeding we clearly do not want to prejudice those proceeding but do not think anyone could read this report and not be absolutely shock by the description of some of the dishonesty this be not just incompetence but dishonesty the manipulation of test and the market it be not possible to read about that in the page of this report and not have renew determination to ensure that justice be deliver for those who deserve that justice rise order thank the prime minister for his remark about the need for caution in comment relate to particular legal case or inquest repeat the waiver that grant under the sub judice rule on june and appeal to all member absolutely to speak but to be cautious about what they say now call the mother of the house do the prime minister recognise how painful it must be for the grenfell community to have have that tower loom over they for seven year and for it to have take seven year even to reach this stage have visit grenfell he will be aware that most of the who die be among the most marginalised and that they be largely people of migrant heritage can he give an assurance that the bereaved will receive all the support they need include financial support and can he also give an assurance that it will not take another seven year to bring those responsible to justice thank my right hon friend for that question she be absolutely right to focus on the community and the bereaved decision on memorial whatever form it take must be take in consultation with the community and give an absolute commitment that we will do that as well as provide the support that they need during my visit have sense just small sense of just how painful this must have be and continue to be we can not allow another seven year to pass before we take the necessary action call the leader of the liberal democrats thank the prime minister for his extremely powerful comment and associate my party with all of they the grenfell disaster be tragedy that sham our whole society the report lay bare failing of government of all party over decade and on behalf of my party be sorry we must all learn from it and do everything we can to change the system in order to prevent more horrifying tragedy like this from happen in the future it be right that we pause today and remember the people who lose their life as well as the survivor and bereaved family and friend who have fight so long and so hard for justice this be their day they have wait far too long to get the truth and many will remain frustrated that even after today they will still be wait for justice and meaningful action let therefore raise three of the many issue that the family have raise first in order to get the justice that the family crave criminality must be investigate try and punish whether it be corporate manslaughter fraud or misconduct in public office will the prime minister confirm that the police prosecutor and court will have all the resource they need to bring those responsible swiftly to justice secondly what more can the prime minister do what more can we all do to bring about great urgency when it come to act on all these recommendation so that the report do not just gather dust on whitehall shelf even now seven year on essential work to make more than building safe have not even start can the prime minister tell the house what more will be do to remove dangerous cladding as quickly as possible force those responsible to pay not the tenant and leaseholder finally we must tackle the big systemic issue that come up time and again in such scandal from hillsborough to horizon to infect blood like the victim of other scandal the bereaved and survivor of grenfell have call for duty of candour on public official and we welcome its inclusion in the king speech can the prime minister tell we when that legislation will be publish and whether the duty will cover all public official join the right hon gentleman in the sense that this have take too long and have be too hard and it be not unique in that respect when it come to injustice of this kind let deal with his specific point it be really important that criminality be fully investigate and we will give the relevant authority all the support and resource necessary we will respond as quickly as possible to the report recommendation within six month it be long report and there be many recommendation and think it be right that we take time to look through they consider how they can comply with and then come back to the house and come back to the house annually to assess the progress that we be make and to be hold to account on it there be no doubt that the removal of cladding need to be speed up and measure have already be take in that regard the right hon gentleman mention the hillsborough law which feature in the king speech the duty of candour be very important we will look at it again in the light of the report because although we be determined to introduce the legislation as quickly as we can it be long overdue think have read some of the report already that it be worth reflect and ensure that what be in the report be incorporate in whatever law we be forward as we have hear it be now more than seven year since people lose their life in grenfell tower in north kensington as we have hear again today the disaster be entirely foresee and entirely preventable it be the result of organisation and individual be systemically dishonest and put profit before people life pay tribute to the next of kin the bereaved and the survivor include those who be here today for their resilience and strength this be very painful day for the community the shameless merry go round of buck passing that have happen for the past seven year must now come to an end so thank the prime minister for his personal commitment to drive last change and hold people accountable can he assure that the government will now do everything in their power to ensure that criminal prosecution take place as soon as possible can he commit to ensure that company identify in the report be exclude from public contract be hold to account to the full extent of the law and pay their full weight of the cost of the building safety remedial work that be necessary can he also ensure that the phase recommendation for central government will be blueprint for real change and that their implementation will be swift and as comprehensive as possible so that we can truly say that tragedy like grenfell will not happen again can confirm that we will do everything to ensure that there be full accountability include criminal accountability where appropriate remind the house as you have do mr speaker that notwithstanding the strong finding in the report the last thing that the victim the bereaved and the community want or need be for anything to go wrong with possible legal proceeding we must all bear that in mind but absolutely understand my hon friend sentiment on the contract stand by what say in my statement concur with my hon friend on the resilience and strength of the victim the family the survivor and the community it must have be really hard to give evidence to the inquiry and it must be really hard to read the detail of what happen in this long report it must be even hard still to read the conclusion about the failure and the dishonesty so we must pay respect to their resilience and strength very sadly for most of we this report be not surprise because many of the thing that be be say over many year have now come to fruition in its recommendation as the prime minister have rightly allude to it be clear that the conspiracy around the testing of product must be subject to criminal proceeding will he therefore look immediately at some of the recommendation that affect the government namely bring responsibility under one department with one minister be responsible and answerable to this house to make sure that action be take secondly will he ensure that single regulator be introduce to make sure that the various different aspect that be clearly wrong do not occur again thank the hon gentleman for his question which be really important we will report back on all the recommendation within six month but if we can act more quickly on some of they we will do so straightaway we have six month to report back but if there be recommendation that we can accept and move forward we will do so rather than wait for the end of the six month period because it be very important for all the reason that he powerfully put across thank the prime minister for his comment on the community in north kensington which be also my community in shepherd bush and hammersmith grenfell tower be daily presence not only for the survivor and the family of victim but for all of we in west london particularly those who live in the many high rise building surround grenfell will the prime minister ensure that all housing be build safe and make safe from the risk of fire which his predecessor fail to do above all will he pledge that those complicit in the grenfell fire be bring to justice so that there be no mistake about their guilt or their punishment it be important that there be full accountability and that where appropriate people be bring to justice that be the least that the family the survivor the bereaved and the community deserve absolutely understand my hon friend point about the wide community this tragedy have impact the wide community as he well know from his work as the constituency mp see bit of that when visit there be various writing on the wall around the memorial where people from the area have record their private view and they be an important read for anybody who want to be in position of leadership thank the prime minister for his statement and also thank sir martin moore bick may refer the prime minister to recommendation after piper alpha an independent offshore safety investigation body be establish after the paddington rail crash we establish the independent rail accident investigation board former fire and housing minister nick raynsford former chief investigator of the air accident investigation branch keith conradi lead building control specialist and make submission to the inquiry recommend that there should be independent incident investigation of serious building failure of this nature which would be able to conduct an investigation far more quickly than public inquiry and with accumulate expertise however that role have be leave to the london fire brigade which have be heavily criticise and would therefore be conflict in any investigation of similar incident that be why the lfb be not put in charge of investigate this incident in the first place could we come and see the prime minister about this very serious matter thank the hon member for raise really serious issue we will of course look at that recommendation we will report to the house and will make sure that meeting be set up so that he be able to input directly into our consideration on that particular recommendation and any other that he have concern about first and foremost today be about the family of grenfell and the people who die for they today be another emotionally exhausting day but we must remember that their fight for justice be also our fight grenfell lay bare the sad truth of the stigma attach to social housing it be stigma remember experience when people make assumption because live on council estate it be stigma that attach to people from all walk of life teacher doctor and firefighter they be people who pay their rent on time but who be treat with disdain by housing provider this damn report confirm that people voice be ignore and that safety concern about the industry be ignore or disregard at all level of the government and the housing sector it be unforgivable the prime minister have speak about the culture will he commit to ensure that this new government address the culture within our housing sector which often treat social housing tenant as an afterthought my hon friend speak powerfully and make really important point in relation to social housing and the report be litter with example of disrespect and of people not be listen to or take seriously yes policy and regulation be part of the answer to this issue but policy and regulation on their own be not the complete answer there have to be change in culture and behaviour and turn corner need to mean something more than pass new law or put in place new guidance much need though that be it mean all of we adopt different culture and behaviour otherwise we will be back here in do know how many year have the same debate again and we can not visit that on the victim the survivor the deceased and the community of grenfell our heart ache at the injustice and horror that befell individual and their family at grenfell tower and commend the prime minister for the strength and power of his remark from the dispatch box today can he give commitment that his government will continue to work constructively with the devolved government to ensure the quick removal of all clad right across these isle so that we do not see repeat of this horrible tragedy yes and that be really important point regardless of where someone live or which government they live under the right to safe and secure housing be important the deputy prime minister have already meet the first minister of scotland and we will take every opportunity to work jointly on this issue how many time must we come here and hear another example of how the state which should be on the side of ordinary people become the enemy of working class people we have have hillsborough the horizon post office scandal the contaminate blood scandal windrush and the treatment of former armed force personnel who be member of the lgbt community in each of those the state have become the enemy of the people and delay pay compensation to they can the grenfell inquiry be watershed when we end the process by which the state become the enemy of working class people we treat they with the dignity they deserve and we ensure that their compensation be pay rapidly and not delay as it have be in all those other case in the case of freeholder who be still hold out and not pay for the remedial work to their property it be about time they pay fine for delay that work that be really important point because there have be do know how many example of injustice where people have not be listen to and have be disregard different prime ministers over the year have stand at this dispatch box and quite genuinely make commitment on the back of report do not doubt that for minute think every prime minister who have stand here in relation to any of those injustice mean every word that he or she say in response and yet it go on so there be something more fundamental that we have to make time to consider because do not want to be back at this dispatch box or any future prime minister to be at this dispatch box have version of the same discussion about injustice about people be disregard not listen to and not take seriously after the event for too long and about justice come too late for people who desperately need it that be what mean by turn corner the inquiry report be damn and the testimony that we hear be utterly devastating first and foremost all our thought be with the victim the survivor the bereaved and everybody affect in the last parliament many of we fight tooth and nail on cross party basis to improve the fire safety bill and the building safety bill so that social tenant and leaseholder who be still live in building cover in cladding and with other fire safety defect could get that remediation work do as quickly as possible it be now clear that in some case the waterfall system that have be set up by which we identify who be responsible be simply not work and be take far too long one idea that be on the table in the last parliament be that in some case the government could put the money up to pay for the remediation to take away the risk and then use the power of the state and its lawyer to go after those responsible with penalty so that the taxpayer would not lose out will the prime minister who say that this be moment of change and have commit to speed thing up please review that idea to see whether it could be use in some limited case where there have still be no action that be really important point from my own constituency know of example where there be contract then subcontract subcontract and another subcontract in one case in my constituency it go through seven subcontractor before the person who be actually responsible be find everybody simply take cut of the contract and pass it on that be real problem and we have to get to the bottom of it we can not allow that to happen of course we will consider any proposal that be put forward in response to this report but this be very real problem of contract simply be subcontract over and over again try to find accountability be very very difficult thank the prime minister for his statement today recently visit the grenfell site with lord boateng who be in the gallery today we do not mention name excuse mr speaker everybody there at grenfell want people to be hold responsible those in boot but also those in suit lot of money have also go missing and some have call for the use of joint enterprise to ensure that everybody be hold responsible some survivor have write poetry book and there be one poem call so what simon by mary gardiner this be just the ending this be not about mercy grace or kindness it about justice and honesty and believe we be all bear equal and that be how we die no amount of wealth can make we differ so much that where we live become rabbit hutch change your mind you people with power or give it over and let we flower do the prime minister agree that justice delay be justice deny yes do and particularly agree that justice be not question of grace or kindness it be an entitlement it be an entitlement of every single citizen in this country and that need to be honour as we go forward from here can just take the opportunity to thank all those work on the memorial which know be very important the work on the memorial be at an important stage and know it be very important to the community thank the prime minister for his statement today the grenfell fire be an unimaginable tragedy but as he rightly say it be also comprehensive failure by the british state and in many respect that comprehensive failure persist today be grateful for the word that he say about give all resource and support to the police and the crown prosecution service because clearly the victim the survivor and the community of north kensington want the insight and the answer that they have partly have today but they also want justice and that need to be deliver as soon as possible equally fully support the effort that the prime minister be go to make to see if further regulatory change be require they need to be make in proportionate and effective way and there be lesson to be learn from change that we have make in the recent past but when make those change can urge he to look in particular at the status of the testing facility the building research establishment and at the way it operate which think have fail significantly as be lay out in the report finally concur with the broad point that the prime minister make today which be that when one speak to the victim and their family one be leave with very strong sense that many people in social housing in our country feel that they be second class citizen and that they be be treat with disrespect that must end will he take forward the work that begin with the social housing white paper to ensure that that never happen again yes all support will be give to the police and the cps and absolutely agree that this must be do as swiftly as possible think the police make statement in relation to that early today will look at the particular point the right hon gentleman raise in relation to testing think the whole house need to come together to recognise that in social housing there have be profound disrespect for very long time across number of community and we have to turn corner on that follow the wildfire of in dagenham and rainham the ongoing crisis at launders lane in rainham and now the devastating fire at the spectrum building also in my constituency will the prime minister join in commend the outstanding work of our emergency service will he also comment on the government plan to improve fire resilience and safety in residential building and to hold those who be responsible to account when tragedy like this happen yes it be important that they be hold to account thank my hon friend for raise those issue in relation to dagenham and join she in commend the emergency service who have to respond to these awful incident from speak to some of the first responder get real sense of the impact it have on they know that the deputy prime minister have visit the dagenham scene in the last few day thank the prime minister for his statement and the way he deliver it and sir martin for his comprehensive report the needless death that happen at grenfell will never go away and never be forget those of we who have be on the silent walk for grenfell every year since it happen and visit many time fully understand the strength of feeling and the deep anger in the community at this needless loss of life bring about by contract culture deregulation privatisation ignorance and frankly contempt for working class community by many who should have do much more to protect and defend those people so hope the prime minister word will be carry through and that criminal action will follow against those who deliberately neglect those who be in appalling and extreme danger will the prime minister assure the house that the removal of dangerous cladding that have happen at most local authority own building all over the country will now also take place in the private sector leasehold building that many of our constituent live in where they be face with enormous insurance cost because of the existence of dangerous cladding this have go on for several year and as the company that be responsible for the dangerous cladding refuse to pay up the problem be force on to the people who be themselves the victim who be be put in danger there be so many lesson to be learn from grenfell and hope that the contract culture in local government that the prime minister just speak about the endless subcontracting subcontract and subcontract so that those responsible for dangerous condition evade all responsibility will end also hope that we will end the idea of the local government internal market and instead have the principle of local government delivery of service as the primary responsibility to ensure that all citizen live in safety and that council housing grow rapidly over the next few year and we get more good quality secure council housing build for the good of the people who be live in desperate housing need often in the private rent sector we be take action on that important point about leaseholder be it in relation to insurance or in relation to other issue of which the house be well aware it be important that be include in the work we take forward and be absolutely committed to ensure the quality of council housing and social housing as we build those million home as the whole house know it be not just number that we be talk about each and every person who lose their life be human being to be respect cherish and remember for who they be on the chelsea council estate that have the honour of represent grenfell and the incompetence and indifference show by the local council and the tenant management organisation both before and after the tragedy be still very much discuss one of the strike thing bring out by the report be the extraordinary response of the local community where the official response fail it be hearten to hear the prime minister talk about rebalancing of power which be essential hope that we will ensure that council gather proper information on the disabled people live in social housing of whom die in the grenfell fire to ensure that they can be evacuate safely in such situation as well as take action against company which fully support will the prime minister commit to work closely with local authority to implement the report and to protect our fellow citizen whether they live in social housing or not from this sort of thing happen again thank my hon friend for that question it be really hard to read the part of the report that deal with the indifference and disrespect after the tragedy would have think that after such tragedy whatever the failure that go before these people would at the very least be treat with the utmost respect yet the same disregard and lack of basic respect and dignity continue that be part of what this report be about it be important that there be plan in place for disabled people and we have take that forward for people with disability who be house in circumstance in which they clearly need an evacuation plan of course we will work on this with local authority and all relevant authority one of the thing learn from my interaction with the bereaved survivor and grenfell united during my time as housing minister be that their pain be compound by their frustration at the pace of change even some year after the fire share their frustration as we try to make progress on build safety issue one of the thing that sharpen our mind and make the government machine jump to it be the prospect of external scrutiny hear the prime minister say that he want to return annually to update the house on progress know he will do his good but be afraid that do not think that will give the government machine the kind of impetus require will he recommend to whoever be elect chair of the housing communities and local government committee that they establish sub committee to look at progress on the report recommendation if not will he support the establishment of cross party committee of the house to drive through these change and to monitor government progress although an annual debate be welcome do not think it will give the sense of urgency require to address these issue swiftly the question of external scrutiny be really important and we will of course report annually as the right hon gentleman probably know the report have recommendation on scrutiny that we want to look at carefully and discuss with the community which have strong view on this obviously we will take into account the view of member on both side of the house include on whether this be something select committee should look at be not sure it be my role to tell select committee what to look at but agree that the question of external scrutiny and accountability be really important we have to make sure that the most robust scrutiny be in place do not think have ever hear my right hon and learn friend speak more powerfully more personally or more movingly than he do in this statement know that the more than resident in my constituency who be still live in high rise block with the nightmare of fire risk constantly upon they will welcome what he say about the government take consistent and measured view of the recommendation and move to implement they systematically they will also welcome what he say about the prosecution of those responsible for what sir martin call systematic dishonesty and deliberate and sustained strategy to manipulate the testing process reinforce what the hon member for st albans daisy cooper say about remediation many of the owner of these block have sell on to further owner and to further owner beyond that the prime minister speak about subcontracting but there have also be on selling some of those owner live in tax haven such as the british virgin islands and they be simply not comply they be not even apply to the building safety fund to get this remediation work do will my right hon and learn friend consider very carefully what power the government can take in order to take control of these building get the work do and then recover the cost if necessary by acquire and sell the building themselves thank my hon friend for raise that very real issue one of the thing we need to do be look at what further power may be necessary we can not suggest for minute that the exist legislation guidance and policy be sufficient we need more power and we will look at that and bring proposal back to the house there will be general debate of course because know that many member will want to discuss particular issue face constituent who be fearful of the condition in which they live thank the prime minister for his very serious and compassionate statement the event of june feel like yesterday although can not imagine how the people directly affect be feel right now we must act in every way we can and we must act together as much as possible however note that the inquiry report do not make new proposal on transparency and accountability for social housing tenant and leaseholder particularly on access to fire risk assessment and related information which be still very hard for resident to access see that for myself in london and be still see it in brighton the previous government do not act on the call for housing association to be subject to freedom of information requirement despite they include call make by the information commissioner as long ago as august will the prime minister act now to fix these gap in resident empowerment and access to information that would be very simple but it be not cover by today report we will obviously look at all the recommendation and report back to the house but we need to look at the wide issue too access to risk assessment be an important issue that we be consider there should not be gap one of the benefit of general debate be that it will be an opportunity to raise these and further point which we will take away and consider today my thought be with the victim the survivor the family and the entire grenfell community the systemic dishonesty and many other injustice mean that the people of grenfell be treat like second class citizen successive governments the local authority and industry know about the risk but they fail to act as sir martin say the death that occur be entirely avoidable seven year on no none have face criminal proceeding and there be still thousand live in home wrap in unsafe cladding welcome what the prime minister have say today welcome the way he deliver his statement and be thankful that the government will implement the phase recommendation to ensure that every disabled person live in high rise block have personal evacuation plan specific to their need but when the prime minister return to update the house it be vital that those live in unsafe home have clear deadline for when the flammable or unsafe cladding will be remove so that they can have decent night sleep agree that the work be go too slowly we need to push that work on with clear timetable to ensure it be do in response to the first part of my hon friend question the wording of the report which say that the death be entirely avoidable must be chill for all the family member and the community at large commend the prime minister and the leader of the opposition for their candour and the tone that they adopt it be pitch perfect may press the prime minister on point make by sir max hill kc in broadcast interview this morning about the urgent need for justice and for prosecution to be bring colleague across the house have raise the issue and the prime minister have address it but will he ensure that there be adequate resource in the police arena and capacity in the court system to bring case where appropriate as speedily as possible business be inclined to dissolve themselves and disappear into the ether very quickly will he make sure that there be capacity in both the investigation and prosecution arena to ensure speed we all recognise that people have be wait far too long sir max hill have personal experience of these sort of case as have we need to ensure that resource be in place and that we be clear about the speed of decision making they be not straightforward decision but none the less they should be take as swiftly as possible we need to ensure that the court be in position to handle the case as soon as they be ready to go to court if there be case to go to court join colleague in remember the people who lose their life in the grenfell tower fire tragedy and say to their friend and family that will always fight to deliver justice for their love one as chair of the fire brigades union parliamentary group put on record my admiration for the heroic bravery of the firefighter who attend that night the fbu have long say that deregulation and corporate greed be the reason for the catastrophe and the report vindicate that view do the prime minister agree when will the government set up the statutory advisory body on fire policy in order to give firefighter and control staff voice in set national standard and to ensure lesson be learn when will the timetable for that be set place on record my gratitude to the firefighter on the night have be to grenfell tower can only begin to imagine what it must have be like to have be confront with the situation that they face and to deal with the circumstance they have to deal with time and again our first responder be ask by we rightly to do very challenging thing they do it and we should thank they for that thank the prime minister for take the recommendation so seriously and for raise concern about the parity of esteem for social housing tenant we have see problem in that area so many time so thank he for take those recommendation forward will he join in pay tribute again to the volunteer organisation include the found member of grenfell united as well as member of other charity and church who work tirelessly in the aftermath of the grenfell tragedy passage in the report highlight two group one group be the tmo the business and those charge with responsibility and the other be those who live in the tower those group be treat differently before during and after the tragedy which relate to the question of esteem that the hon lady rightly touch on we must stop talk about the issue and act on it my thought today be with the family and love one of the people who die so tragically in the fire as the report identify those death be entirely avoidable and be the result of corporate greed because profit be put before people some medium and high rise building be still be monitor by the government because they be clothe in unsafe cladding will the prime minister state how he will support leaseholder live in those building whose life be on hold at the moment stand in solidarity with the family in support of justice hope they do not wait as long as the hillsborough family many premise be be monitor that need to continue we need to bear down on all the relevant authority to ensure they be safe and give leaseholder the support they need will the prime minister help to ensure this type of disaster will not happen again by look carefully at build control inspection since deregulation such inspection be often not carry out in person but through phone call and photograph poor inspection of work across the uk building industry mean other such disaster will happen again and again unless we look carefully at how our building control inspection work agree with that the way build control inspection be carry out in this case make for shocking read in the report it be particularly grave but not the only example of such building control inspection we will look at that as we respond to the report thank the prime minister for the most powerful and heartfelt statement have ever hear he make put the victim of the grenfell fire and survivor in the community at the heart of the road map go forward as the prime minister say justice must be speedy with prosecution for those who be involve in systemic dishonesty justice also mean that those responsible for the broad building safety crisis should pay to make building safe so how will the prime minister ensure that now happen at pace justice need to be speedy and in this case it be important we ensure that it be swift we should bear in mind it have already take seven year to get to where we be today which double the need for that speed all those with responsibility need to take responsibility think the word of one member of the inquiry this morning about those with responsibility take the report as template and guide for the future be very important all those with responsibility for building safety include which be why will take that approach in government thank the prime minister for his tone compassion and understanding and the seriousness in his voice and word today honestly and sincerely believe the prime minister speak for everyone in the house in the way he convey the statement and thank he for that on behalf of democratic unionist party member convey our collective sympathy to the family they be never far from our thought even though number of year have pass the report catalogue failure there be similar building in northern ireland so will the finding and recommendation of the report be convey to the minister at the northern ireland assembly with the urgency require ever mindful that the northern ireland housing executive and other be financially stretch what help can be give to deliver the much need improvement across this great nation the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland thank the hon gentleman for raise the question in relation to northern ireland of course we must work with all the relevant authority in northern ireland take the early opportunity after the formation of the government to go to northern ireland to make clear that would be the way will work on all issue that be particularly important in relation to the safety of people in the place that they live thank the prime minister for his statement associate myself with the remark make about think about the victim and their family who be still fight every day for justice welcome the prime minister commitment to ensure they will see justice through the criminal justice system the report make over recommendation and suggestion about the regulatory framework so will he reassure that the government will work closely with local authority to ensure they have the support they need to respond to any additional regulatory burden that might be put on they in the come month and year thank my hon friend for her question it be important that we work on the regulatory framework with local authority and with all those charge with responsibility so that there be justice in this case and secondly that we take the necessary action to ensure that this never happen again welcome the prime minister personal commitment to change the culture and behaviour towards council tenant that allow this tragedy to happen it be national scandal can he ensure that resident tenant and professional firefighter on the frontline be hear and listen to we can not trust those who cause the tragedy in the first place to put thing right that be an important issue this case be an example of where those concerned for their safety in the place where they live have make point put forward issue and raise concern but not be listen to that be characteristic of how not just housing but other aspect of life be deal with we must ensure that we listen to those who be most concerned it be their place their home they be entitle to feel safe and secure there and it be our responsibility to ensure that they be as the prime minister so painfully say the grenfell fire destroy life and rip family apart but constituent of mine be suffer too they be afraid to go to sleep at night because they live in building that be build more recently than grenfell with fire safety risk the building standard that inform the recladding of grenfell and the building of more recent block of flat be strong on thermal insulation to save energy cost but very weak on fire safety and their implementation as we now know from this report have be even bad the building regulation of other jurisdiction cover both thermal insulation and fire safety risk how long will it take for uk building regulation to catch up that be one issue that we will have to look at in light of the report but accept that there be people today in accommodation where they fear for their safety because of the condition in which they be live have speak to some of those people get sense of what it be like for they to worry every night about the safety of themselves and their family particularly those with child thank the prime minister for his statement and his commitment today as he have say the report make it clear that the conservative government obsession with deregulation mean that safety issue be ignore delay or disregarded it say that the government be well aware of the deadly risk of clad before the fire but fail to act it conclude that all death be avoidable this morning grenfell united survivor and bereaved family urge our new government to break old habit and bring systemic change by both separate government from corporate lobbying and tackle social and racial injustice and inequality will the prime minister undertake this work without delay read very carefully what the report say about deregulation as we go forward from here we must avoid the habit of simply blame somebody else for everything and pull together and say that it be our responsibility we be new government irrespective of where the failure lie it be our responsibility now to take this forward to ensure safety know that be sentiment share across the house and thank the leader of the opposition for the approach that he have take if we do it in that way we can do what the survivor the bereaved the family and the community most want which be to show our determination to ensure that this never happen again today report list series of terrible failure that let down the grenfell community the grenfell fire affect community in every part of the uk and wish to pass on the thought of my constituent in irvine to the family and love one fire at storey block of flat in irvine in spread via external cladding the garnock court fire result in one fatality and lead to change to scottish building regulation which the then local mp fight to have implement hope my right hon friend will look at the lesson from the garnock court fire as he start to address this terrible injustice we must look at this question of external cladding some measure have be take in the past seven year as reference in my statement but we need to look at this again the description that be give when be at grenfell tower of how the fire spread and the role play by the cladding be chilling have read the summary of the report may say how difficult it have be to contain one anger like many west london mps here visit the site soon after the fire in the follow month we meet the victim the family of the victim the firefighter the local representative and the traumatise call centre operator some of whom have never recover be castigate then for use the expression social murder this report define it be social murder exactly as the prime minister say we need urgent action we have be promise debate for that debate may we have the definitive report for each of our constituency on what action have be take what action will be take and what the deadline will be may return to recommendation in the report in the building regulation we define high building as above seven storey or metre that take no account of those other property in which there be vulnerable resident in particular who be now at risk the recommendation be to urgently review those regulation may we have timetable for that review as it have consequence for many of our constituent thank my right hon friend for make that point on the debate it be important that as much information as possible be make available and that we be able to deal with the question that member of this house have raise that be why we be look at the date of that debate want it to be as soon as possible but do not want it to be so quick that member will be frustrate because they will rightly want information or assurance that need little bit of work through will try to make sure that that happen the safety of building that be not at the specific height be among the issue that we have to consider here we be all well aware of these very troubling case and they have to be part of the debate that conclude that very serious statement will give those on the front bench some time to vacate the chamber and allow the new ministers to take their seat

the bill should also include any change to the fiscal rule and would require the office for budget responsibility to produce report on their effect on public finance the office for budget responsibility be of course construct by conservative chancellor follow the poor forecasting record of the previous labour government between and the then labour government forecast for economic growth be out by an average of billion and their forecast for the budget deficit three year ahead be out by an average of billion their forecast therefore lack credibility and to re establish confidence and credibility the obr be create by the conservative government labour lack economic credibility in the past and be afraid it still lack it now the fact simply do not stand up the false claim that the government have inherit the bad economic circumstance since the second world war they transparently have not contrary to the rewriting of history that the current labour government be attempt when we take over from labour back in inflation be when they take over from we it be the annual deficit be half what we inherit in unemployment be about half what it be in and we hand labour the fast economic growth in the the dominant political and economic narrative since the second world war be in fact as have be widely comment on that every single labour government end up with unemployment higher at the end of their time in power than when they take over from the conservatives precede they the british public should not be take for fool just because labour keep claim something that do not mean that it suddenly become true which be why clarity over plan and rule be so important the fiscal rule be of course restriction on fiscal policy set by the government to constrain their own decision on spending and taxis the fiscal rule set by the previous government say that the debt to gdp ratio should be fall within five year horizon and that the ratio of the annual budget deficit to gdp should be below by the end of the same period labour manifesto for the election propose the follow fiscal rule balance the current budget so that day to day cost be meet by revenue and that debt must be fall as share of the economy by the fifth year of the forecast on the surface therefore the debt rule appear to be broadly the same under the new government the government have even say that they have an ironclad commitment to reduce government debt it be therefore critical what definition of debt be use for the fiscal rule clearly any change to the fiscal rule be financially significant decision because they affect how much the government can borrow and spend on second reading the exchequer secretary to the treasury say our fiscal rule be non negotiable official report july vol great but why then have the chancellor repeatedly fail to rule out that she will change the definition of debt in her fiscal rule to allow presumably for massive borrowing the government can not run from the scrutiny that they should be subject to if they be consider make such change we believe that our amendment require an obr report on change to the fiscal rule be entirely consistent with the government state policy intent and should therefore be fairly uncontentious after all on second reading the chief secretary to the treasury say that the announcement of fiscally significant measure should always be accompany by an independent assessment of its economic and fiscal implication in order to support transparency and accountability official report july vol we agree and not accept our amendment would be contrary to those goal because clearly change the fiscal rule would be fiscally significant measure in anybody book furthermore the chief secretary say that fiscal discipline and sound money be the bedrock of our plan official report july vol well change the fiscal rule would be change the foundation and that bedrock transparency and clarity be important in relation to the public finance because ministers should never forget that it be not their money that they be spend it be the public money the public have right to know how their money be be spend and government be about make difficult choice with limited resource with government spending be above trillion per year the british public recognise that the government clearly have choice it be not an endless supply of money but it be very very large amount in the last few week the new labour government choose to spend the public money on pay settlement for their union friend rather than on support pensioner those settlement be estimate to cost about billion they also choose to spend billion on public energy company and billion on national wealth fund so far from inherit billion black hole they have actually just spend billion create one within their first few week of come to power my hon friend be make fantastic speech on the importance of be responsible with our public finance much of the bill be concern with responsibility and transparency do he know whether the government publish an impact assessment when they take away the winter fuel allowance thank my hon friend for that point my understanding be that the government have not publish an impact assessment as would normally be the case for something with such significant impact think that speak to the whole narrative that we be hear from the government claim one thing when the fact speak differently as say far from inherit billion black hole they have actually spend or commit to spending an additional billion that be choice that they make so the claim that the labour government be have to take the winter fuel allowance away from million of pensioner as response to unexpected financial constraint simply do not stack up against the fact or indeed the word of the chancellor herself who on march yes decade ago say we be the party who have say that we will cut the winter fuel allowance for the rich pensioner and mean test that benefit to save report march vol that be direct quote in hansard from the current chancellor so no the government restriction of winter fuel payment be not response to financial circumstance it be long establish clearly state labour policy intent deliberate policy choice but policy that they conveniently forget to tell the public about in the run up to the last election hope however that the government can be straight with the public on this point about the fiscal rule accept the amendment that we be propose and provide assurance to all member and the outside world that there be no sleight of hand here we want the bill to work as they say it be intend to and to include financially significant decision such as on the level of government borrowing and the fiscal rule would therefore appreciate it if the chief secretary to the treasury confirm in his wind up that the government do not intend to change the definition of debt in their fiscal rule or practise some accounting trick to hide the level of government borrowing and that they do indeed wish to be clear and transparent about the public finance if labour members vote against our amendment it will merely prove that they be plan to change their fiscal rule in the budget to borrow more money increase debt and run away from independent obr scrutiny the very opposite of the state intent of the bill call dr jeevun sandher to make his maiden speech thank you madam chair for allow to give my maiden speech in this house like every member across this house it be the great honour privilege and responsibility of my life to represent my community of loughborough shepshed and the village rise at the most difficult moment for our community and our country since the second

community be member of an under represent minority be of course the first member of parliament elect by the man and woman of loughborough to have beard to the organiser of the beard of the year competition say call luckily for my dad be not eligible for that particular competition know that the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn have win the award several time hope he do not mind win the prize this time as long as let he win the argument my predecessor in this place jane hunt be not contender for that award but no one can doubt her commitment to team loughborough and

in my constituency be low than they would be have we grow at new labour rate the divide cause by deindustrialisation have widen from crack into chasm with young man who use to leave school and get good job now less likely to get any job in our most deprive neighbourhood life expectancy fall before the pandemic more than any fact or figure the despair the despondency and the anger across and beyond our shore war in europe once more with democracy in danger and most seriously of all planet that be burn for my community this be the hot summer we have ever know follow by the bad flooding we have ever see destroy home the prime minister and see that destruction when we visit the home of ian and alan no one should wake up in the morning to find their home destroy by flooding but that will only become more common in the year ahead what we do in the next decade will determine the fate of our community of democracy and of our planet either we will rise to this moment build prosperity for all protect democracy and stop emit carbon or everything we hold dear will crumble and fall previous generation have show we that we can rise to this moment that threaten we our country stand alone against fascism in europe and win think today of my constituent william williams year old who fly spitfires in the war as his generation rise to their moment so can we my community have show that we can when the water come and the flood rise my constituent caz and carl do not pause to think if they could help only how they could help they organise collection they provide refuge and they look after perfect stranger it be their spirit that carry into this place ask not if but how how can we build prosperity and protect our planet from burn we can do so by invest in green transition that create good job and get wage rise for the people and place leave behind when the factory close that be what we can achieve and we be see it work already in the united states in my community there be world lead hydrogen research and industry we need green hydrogen for fertiliser and to keep our truck move it be not coincidence that have choose to speak in this debate with treasury ministers on the front bench say to they get out the cheque be very excited by will be ask for money from both the national wealth fund and gb energy however this be about more than cash it be about rebuild hope and prosperity as previous generation rise to their moment in the midst of the most destructive war in the history of humankind an economist write report that still define our nation he write freedom from

healthcare for all as that generation rise to their moment so will we by build prosperity protect our planet and end despair and despondency as previous generation rise to their moment we will too with the hope and determination that define our community and that define our country very strong maiden speech without script in hand your parent will be proud it be delight as ever to serve under your chairmanship ms ghani congratulate the hon member for loughborough dr sandher on his maiden speech and his kind comment about his predecessor jane hunt great colleague of this house it be one of my great pleasure in my previous role as minister for science and research to visit the fine university he now represent wish he and they well and wish he all the good of luck with those on his front bench in procure the financial support he seek this be disreputable bill if we be brutally honest it be piece of political theatre which all of we on both side of this house should think very strongly about give our support to this history of this place be of legislation make in haste which this house subsequently repent at leisure say this in all seriousness and in the spirit of this place at time when there be low trust in politic do our constituent do the hon gentleman constituent when they troop to the ballot box and return he to this place only week ago seriously expect that our role would be to give away even more of our responsibility can any of we hand on heart say that our constituent know what and who the obr be do the elector of bristol north west hampstead and highgate richmond park or indeed arundel and south downs send we to this place only to give away our duty and responsibility to the unnamed unknown and unelected official well meaning no doubt of the office for budget responsibility hand on the face of stop clock be sometimes more accurate than the obr forecast as they be at least correct twice day for sure in truth this legislation put together at breakneck speed have more hole than swiss cheese if we look at clause who decide the cost propose new section exempt any measure that be intend at the time of its introduction to be temporary member of this house will be familiar with the fact that income tax itself one of the large ever fiscal measure be intend to be temporary perhaps the minister will address that fact when he wind up income tax be introduce by pitt the younger in as temporary measure well here we be year later and that temporary measure be still go extremely strong who define what be and be not fiscal measure measure with potential impact on the gdp of this country many thing decide in this house will have direct or indirect impact on the gdp of this country the decision by tony blair to take we to war without vote in this house undoubtedly have an impact on our gdp decision to introduce four day working week if this house so choose to make they as be its right would have material impact on the gdp of this country the centre for business and economic research estimate that every bank holiday cost this country sum approach billion three four five or six bank holiday add up to impact on gdp which speculate may be the threshold for the obr to intervene on trade deal if those on the government benches fulfil their ambition to realign with europe to federate and once again abrogate our trade to europe that would potentially have material fiscal impact on gdp there be very few domain of this house very few of the decision that our constituent have send we here to legislate and decide on their behalf that would not potentially fall foul of this rule will delight the hon gentleman because as be sure he see on the amendment paper have table an amendment that would look at trade deal one of the reason why feel compel to do that and explore this question that he raise about the economic impact be that while he be in government and indeed treasury minister the government do not publish any information for the very trade deal he be talk about will always welcome sinner who repenteth but for the avoidance of doubt be he say that he now believe there should be independent scrutiny of thing such as the trade and co operation agreement it be good to have proper debate certainly think that if we want and seek good government which like the human condition be not perfect state but state that we should seek constantly to perfect the high level of transparency and the very important exercise in government publishing of impact assessment when they make material decision as require by cabinet office guidance be thing that the whole house should join hand and agree on it be one of the reason why ask my colleague my hon friend the member for droitwich and evesham nigel huddleston whether the government have publish an impact assessment on their callous decision to withdraw the winter fuel allowance from so many pensioner the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy will well know that the process of trade deal undergo extensive scrutiny in this house and take one of those trade deal through that process of scrutiny in former life will conclude because simply want to alert hon member to what they be potentially do as they seek to support this bill it be not for partisan or political advantage but about the important role of parliament which have be litigate many time in this chamber and in debate unsurprisingly have listen to the hon gentleman speech on number of occasion and agree with quite lot of what he be say about transparency do he agree that the burden of his argument be that we can not make government behave well or govern more effectively by quango this quango be set up by george osborne to trap an incoming labour government and restrict and slow they down and it be an odd thing that we see this quango be gild as ever the hon member make an important and weighty contribution he be exactly right about the direction of travel on both side of the house we will all find our own particular point on the envelope when it come to the balance around organisation that can hold we to account and in particular hold mirror to government and ensure that this house act with the good most accurate and well mean datum my core point be that we be send here by our constituent again congratulate the hon member for loughborough who have be send here on behalf of his constituent and have give fine speech today but do not believe he may intervene and correct that the citizen of loughborough whether they vote for jane hunt or for he intend that one of the very first action he and we would take as legislator would be to award more of our power and place more fetter on ourselves this be the right chamber for accountability we should hold ourselves to account we have number of way in which to do that to ourselves the hon member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer make very real point about quango arm length body and how we hold ourselves to account that be my point understand that many colleague wish to get in support the amendment put forward by my hon friend the member for droitwich and evesham because it be quite right that we have rule be an accountant by training and the first thing we learn whether someone be an accountant or in performance sport be that we play by the rule as they be we do not seek to rig the rule in our favour it be pleasure to speak in the same debate as the maiden speech give by my hon friend the member for loughborough dr sandher be sure other speech be come that will show just how impressive the new generation of mps be across the house it be also joy to follow the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith because have always enjoy the experience of listen to he when he be treasury minister in the previous government watch he debate with he and try to encourage he to take on the buy now pay later lender that be relate to what will say about legal loan sharking but have to be honest be lecture by former conservative ministers about fiscal probity be bit like be lecture by toad of toad hall about safe driving give the experience of many of our constituent which have lead to the need for this legislation put on record my support for this legislation because frankly anybody who have have to renegotiate mortgage since the liz truss budget know exactly why it be need and why we must protect the british public from the consequence of bad decision making at national level as we see in many example under the previous administration the public have pay the price for that and will continue to do so of course the legislation do not fetter previous government but it would fetter the discretion of the hon lady own front benchers in that context do she not have the same confidence in her front bench that many other seem to enjoy be bit disappointed that the hon member do not seek to call ratty be also quite strike by the fact that he former conservative treasury minister rise not to hold himself accountable for the consequence of decision make by the previous government or indeed to defend they but simply to say you will be hold to high fiscal standard we on the labour benches welcome high fiscal standard that be the purpose of the legislation political decision will still be make but we will make they with the benefit of independent information he will know that there be many debate in the previous parliament and indeed in those before it in which independent information about and verification of the economic impact of policy matter but be miss indeed he mention trade deal which be an example of where we do not have independent information will comment on that only briefly because my amendment have not be select he will be as disappointed as be about that the amendment that have table be intend to probe the legislation and the concept of fiscally significant amendment and and indeed amendment although it be not consider in scope for selection be about how we hold ourselves to account for the impact on future generation be not here to make maiden speech be essentially the old guard now because have be here for know it be very sad my hon friend the member for northampton north lucy rigby be look at in horror you be not as old guard as some yes but in that time many of we have have persistent concern and one of mine have always be the private finance initiative the government be ask all of we to make and support some very tough decision because of the economic mess that the country now find itself in my view be that we must look at all outgoing in that process if somebody come to constituency surgery because they have multiple outstanding loan and could not pay their rent we would look at the debt that they hold that be the challenge with private finance it be the legal loan sharking of the public sector amendment and be about the process of get grip on our debt and ensure that we learn from the damage that private finance have do let we be clear nobody can absolve themselves from private finance government of all persuasion have seek to use that process the ability to put only the repayment on the book rather than the substantial cost of borrowing that start under john major yes there be multiple pfi under the previous labour government and indeed the previous conservative government continue to use private finance until that be why as of february this year there be still pfi scheme represent capital value of billion but for which we will pay back billion in the year ahead we be ask pensioner to pay more for heat their home but we should be ask how we can pay less for the private finance debt that we have build up private finance be about be able to build thing such as school and hospital anybody who have an outstanding pfi debt in their constituency or school or hospital that urgently need rebuilding such as whipps cross hospital in my constituency understand the importance of be able to access private finance for the avoidance of doubt be not say through my amendment that we should never work with the private sector be say that pfi be catastrophically bad deal and that cumulatively it would meet the legislation target of of gdp so it be fiscally significant policy my amendment be about try to understand how we will deal with cumulative debt and cumulatively fiscally significant policy agree completely with my hon friend as member of the even old guard than her the original og be certainly the old guard from the start of the previous labour government that be relevant because have discussion at the time with the then paymaster general geoffrey robinson about the cost of pfi for hospital his answer be succinct if you want the hospital you have to go down the pfi route he say that because the treasury rule be so rigid about find money for socially need project hospital in that case the government have to work around they at what would eventually be huge cost to the taxpayer there be warning there about rigid rule and not deal with reality it will not surprise my hon friend that agree with he not just about his football team but in his analysis the legislation be about have well fiscal rule and tough constraint when government make decision we see with the liz truss budget how catastrophic those decision can be many member will have come across pfi in their constituency but it be worth put on the record just how big it be because that be relevant to the legislation we be talk about project but each project can be hundred of individual building one of those project be make up of school for example which show the scale that we be talk about about half of pfi be hold between the department of health and social care and the department for education that be how we build desperately need school and hospital but the cost be absolutely critical some nhs trust be now spend of their total budget on pfi billion year for some in practical term that mean that some trust be spend more to repay what be essentially payday loan for the public sector than they be spend on drug for their patient it be huge drain on our public finance in during the pandemic norfolk and norwich university hospitals nhs foundation trust pay million to service its pfi commitment the same amount that it spend on lab equipment surgical tool and personal protective equipment university college london hospitals nhs foundation trust have already pay out million in dividend to the company that own its pfi so the money be not just go to repay debt for build hospital it be go out in pure profit to those company that be why draw the parallel with payday lender and buy now pay later company once you be hook in you have to keep pay the debt it be not just problem in the nhs hanson academy in bradford have reach debt of million because of its pfi debt it be now refer to as the uk orphan school because nobody want to run it or take it over give its financial position liverpool city council pay million year for parklands high school which be again build under pfi but be no long need because of fall school roll the council have roughly million leave to pay back on that contract for an empty dead building the equity solution company that own it have post profit of from that project this year alone pfi company have make million in pre tax profit from education project alone that be about per project and the equivalent of new teacher salary the company take on the risk of those deal to rebuild our public infrastructure but the reality be that we do not let school and hospital go bust so they take on the ability to print money that be what the deal be do will wager that every new and return mp have have conversation with someone in local government local hospital or local school who talk about the damage that pfi be do to their budget as if it be non negotiable my amendment be about change that culture one challenge be that we have let those company run rampant that do not mean that we should not work with the private sector it mean that we should learn lesson and think we could learn some very simple one for start lot of the company be incorporate in overseas territory which raise question about the amount of tax that they be pay on those deal tax be originally part of the treasury assessment of the deal which be why work in that way be consider good value for money and why my hon friend the member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer be tell that it be the good way to get school or hospital we could also learn from payday lending by cap what the company pay after all we cap the return on defence project it make no economic or ethical sense that we cap what can be earn from military contract but when someone build school or hospital they have free rein above all we need to know how much we owe because even the infrastructure and projects authority within government could not get grip on the total reality of our pfi commitment to date that be partly because this have be do at local government level through devolution and in silo within company but it seem very simple thing even if those debt be be hold overseas the people pay they be very much here in northampton there be school cost million per annum include million in pre tax profit in and northampton budget as local authority be in very difficult position right now the firm that own all those school be base in guernsey in birmingham school be part of the birmingham schools partnership own by innisfree innisfree own school across this country as well as my local hospital in whipps cross it be base in jersey and be make million of pound in profit from these deal we have never consolidate those loan to ask ourselves whether we could renegotiate they as country and therefore claw some money back because we do not know who we owe what to or how much it be go to cost amendment and deal with the challenge pose by the threshold of this legislation it be absolutely right to set threshold for what be fiscally significant and individual pfi would not go anywhere near threshold of of gdp which be about billion however when we add they up it be very clear from what we already know about our pfi commitment that they do as such these amendment be intend to probe the government about how we deal with debt and spending that might not meet that threshold individually but might do so cumulatively and to look at what we can do in the future to make sure that if we work with the private sector again be not say that we should never do so be say that we should learn from pfi we make well decision after all this legislation be about make well inform independent decision that be why also table amendment to learn the lesson from trade deal the hon member for arundel and south downs be right the government decision to go for the trade and co operation agreement the hard of brexits have cost we an estimate of gdp so again that would be fiscally significant decision it would be as catastrophic as that liz truss budget indeed many of we can see that it have be but we do not have an independent assessment amendment and amendment which be an enable amendment would ensure that we have an independent assessment of cumulative spending look at these issue know that the minister be as interested as be in what we can do to tackle the drain that pfi represent and work well with the private sector hope that this legislation and the concept of put pfi on the book be the start of conversation about well public spending and hope that toad of toad hall will recognise that maybe this time it be good that they be in the passenger seat will speak in favour of amendment to which be table in my name once again welcome this bill and this government intent to rebuild trust with the financial market and across our economy as whole the liberal democrats be optimistic about the new government state commitment to build strong platform for economic growth particularly after year of conservative turmoil remain hopeful that this bill can support fiscal responsibility and transparency and help prevent repeat of the conservatives disastrous mini budget the amendment table in my name would strengthen the legislation so that that aim can be achieve welcome the concern that the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith have show for my constituent in richmond park and their thought about this legislation but wonder where his concern for my constituent be when the government of which he be part cheer on champion and vote for that disastrous mini budget that so undermine our stable economy to the detriment of the wellbeing of individual community and business liberal democrats understand how much our constituent have suffer from the increase in mortgage payment high fuel bill and escalate food price we understand the disastrous effect of the chaos and uncertainty work by the previous conservative government in their horrendous mismanagement of the economy and we know that future prosperity can only be build upon firm foundation we know the heavy burden that our constituent continue to feel in their pocket and their personal finance and we know that they deserve well as have previously acknowledge the broad positive response that this bill have evoke across the business and finance sector be indicative of the desire for stability and we welcome the engagement from economist such as the new hon member for loughborough dr sandher who wish well in the beard of the year contest and industry expert who advise of the beneficial impact this bill will have on confidence in the public finance we have carefully scrutinise the detail of the bill to make sure it will achieve its intend aim in particular we have look closely at the threshold for fiscally significant measure which will be set at of gdp or approximately billion and whether the propose fiscal lock could be circumvent by government announce major change that fall just below that threshold although we understand that the bar have be set relatively high to prevent large scale irresponsible fiscal event such as the disastrous mini budget we be aware of the limitation this place on the bill especially when it come to measure that might have relatively small up front cost to the government but significant indirect fiscal or economic effect therefore ask treasury ministers whether gdp measure alone can adequately capture the impact on the economy of spending or taxation measure and whether the government should examine the possibility of use additional criterion when set the threshold that be why have table amendment which would broaden the definition of fiscally significant measure to include those that fall below the cost threshold but could have wide fiscal and economic effect the amendment would ensure that the obr be able to produce report when it judge that propose measure be likely to affect interest rate the cost of government borrowing or economic growth whereas fiscal lock base solely on gdp could leave open the possibility of circumvention that wide definition would enable the obr to step in if it think it likely that government measure might precipitate the kind of economic disaster we see after the mini budget it be possible to imagine situation where fiscal measure fall just short of the of gdp threshold but be none the less likely to carry significant ramification for the cost of government borrowing for economic growth and crucially for interest rate we can not forget that any spike in interest rate do not just carry grave consequence for the public finance but have huge impact on household finance and people living standard we all witness mortgage rate skyrocket in the aftermath of the previous government catastrophic mini budget and million of family be still struggle with high bill as result it be therefore wholly appropriate that interest rate be take into consideration when assess whether measure be fiscally significant this bill be an encouraging sign of this government intention to act with more integrity and transparency than the last but its provision alone may not be enough to protect voter from the consequence of another disastrous mini budget if future chancellor or prime minister be so minded to deliver one that be why strengthen the fiscal lock by broaden the definition of fiscally significant measure be such vital safeguard also wish to speak in favour of amendment which would enable the obr to notify the independent adviser on ministers interest if they think failure to request report ahead of fiscal event might constitute breach of the ministerial code the mini budget be clearly the moment when the conservative party carelessness take our country to the brink however we should not forget that it be the culmination of year of mismanagement and disregard for the principle of good governance from conservative party that consider itself to be above the rule sideline the obr ahead of major fiscal event be the pinnacle of the arrogance we have see so many time before the ministerial code put in place guardrail that be crucial for good governance it promote essential principle such as transparency accountability and openness for example it state that ministers have duty to be as open as possible with parliament and the public those be principle that all government should abide by especially when they relate to economic matter and the liberal democrats have long call for the ministerial code to be enshrine in legislation in the same vein amendment would provide for useful scrutiny of the government action by empower the obr to notify the independent adviser on ministers interest if they have reason to believe that vital principle of the code may have be violate we must never again have government put the country finance at risk out of their disdain for the rule and this amendment would help achieve that aim finally wish to speak in favour of amendment and their purpose be to strengthen scrutiny of any change to the charter for budget responsibility so that provision of the bill can not be circumvent simply by revise the threshold set out in that charter full consultation along with an extended period of scrutiny would ensure that parliament and the public be fully informed of any propose change and give the opportunity to engage with they improve transparency and accountability responsible public finance be essential for the stability certainty and confidence that drive economic growth and for get mortgage rate under control the conservative government have show all too clearly the damage and pain cause by fiscal irresponsibility therefore urge the house to accept the amendment have table the liberal democrats want to see thriving british economy one that provide job and opportunity for work people and be attractive to business and investor we believe that this bill be significant step in promote long term stability and we urge the government to accept our amendment which would strengthen the legislation and help create the condition for responsible economic governance rise think would offer some tip to colleague in the chamber if you be bob you will be call if you be on the list but be not bob you be indicate to the chair or the speaker that you no long wish to be call so if you hope to be call bob throughout the debate if you be on the list and commit to bob but leave the chamber you be indicate to the chair or the speaker that you no long wish to be priority on the list however you can speak to the chair or the speaker and ask permission to leave and return and you will then remain where you be in the priority list unless member stand do not know whether they wish to contribute to the debate so who wish to bob rise call amanda martin to make her maiden speech thank you ms ghani start by commend my hon friend for their impassioned speech particularly my hon friend the member for loughborough dr sandher he will be pleased to know that will not be contender this year in the competition that he mention maybe later menopause depend it be huge honour to stand before you today as the newly elect member of parliament for portsmouth north this moment be not lose on be fill with immense emotion at the thought of represent the place where everyone love life portsmouth be city rich in history innovation and most importantly community spirit and pride it be also place of first throughout our city storied history we have be pioneer in many field be it shipbuilde maritime trade or cultural advancement portsmouth have always lead the way and it be that spirit of innovation that intend to champion while in this house be deeply humble to make my maiden speech in this debate highlight the importance of fiscal standard because during the election campaign so many people tell that their mortgage have go through the roof or that they have lose the ability to buy or rent their first home or indeed any home because of the action of the last government understand personally what it be like when full time job do not even cover the bill my gramp be train driver he teach the importance of hard work and public service he introduce to the trade union movement and to the labour party which be proud to say have be at the centre of my adult life my mum be factory seamstress and my dad be plumber and then police officer as kid time be tough but our house be always full of love humour and determination my dad work three job and my mum set about make childhood the very good it could be my gramp navigate the track with precision and care my mum sew with love and my dad serve his community know will bring the same attitude to my time in this house because the opportunity here be so very precious like so many of my colleague on the government benches be the first in my family to go to university and the first to become teacher but thankfully not the last to enter what still deem to be the very good profession in the world the right education really do empower young people and give they belief and the opportunity to succeed whatever their background and circumstance be so very proud to be part of government who will bring down the barrier to opportunity and tackle child poverty work across department to ensure that all kid get the good start in life have be teacher for year know that not everyone have the start in life that feel privileged to have have be allow to try thing and fail be great lesson my working class background mean that sometimes seem bit impatient this be because know that people from my background must fight hard and do not often get second chance so they have to seize every opportunity as it arise as an mp want to champion child and young people from all background across my city so that they be give every chance to succeed and fulfil

that speech will delight every corner of portsmouth north call dave doogan it be great pleasure to follow the hon member for portsmouth north amanda martin and that rundown of her fantastic constituency want to go there now that have hear about it although she might be surprised to know that be quite familiar with that part of the world around portsmouth north fareham gosport hayling island and southsea it be beautiful part of the world and while it can not compete with scotland in scenery it certainly win the day when it come to weather in the summertime she might also be surprised to know that there be fairly high concentration of pompey supporter in perthshire that be legacy of the royal naval aircraft workshop outside perth when people use to go down to the royal naval aircraft yard in gosport and pick up loyalty to pompey from there offer many congratulation not least on fantastic maiden speech but also on those exceptional shoe be concern indeed trouble as many people will be about the role of the treasury and chancellor in the last couple of month we be here to talk about budget responsibility and wonder what answer we would get if we be to ask the of pensioner on these island who be about to be strip of their winter fuel payment what they think be responsible about that budget intervention we could ask the million live in poverty across these island disgrace in and of itself what they think about budget responsibility in their life now double scupper by labour two child cap we could ask the million of work poor across these island who be try to do right by their child their employer and just pay their bill to get by and who put their kid to bed every night and then sit up all night worry about everything what difference this fiscal lock will make to their life the chancellor first two act on take up her role be to make life hard for the poor family in society who have the least once she have dispatch they she turn her fire on pensioner remove their winter fuel allowance austerity it do not matter to scotland whether austerity come in labour or tory wrapper it be still as caustic that be relevant because the chancellor want we to believe that the bill and the fiscal lock will make everything okay but it do not the office for budget responsibility will take no view on the qualitative merit or otherwise of any treasury decision but merely on the quantitative dimension in fiscal term there be no lock in the bill to protect the people of these island from this labour chancellor we hear ad nauseam that the chancellor have no choice in any of these action and the bad inheritance since the war and it go on and on well the number may be little bit bad than they think at the time and think there be some thing that be hide from view but the overall picture over the next four or five year be very very similar to what we know before the election those be not my word but those of paul johnson the director of the institute for fiscal studies if that be not good enough the snp warn throughout the election that if labour stick to tory spending plan taxis would rise budget would be cut and here we be the snp even challenge labour in scotland on that point during the election and the leader of labour in scotland anas sarwar say read my lip no austerity under labour he be not say that now be he because he can not perhaps the chancellor or those on her front bench can advise we about whether mr sarwar be have stumble with the truth that day or whether they have forget to let their branch office in scotland in on the plan despite all that the chancellor and her treasury front bench persist in their claim about billion black hole to defend their indefensible attack on the poor in society it be unacceptable and the bill if enact will do nothing to protect community from that be also trouble by the language that those on the treasury front bench seek to use to accrue some form of disproportionate credit for bring forward the bill at its core the bill be nothing more than an additional provision to the exist act and the exaggerated language around it expose the weakness of the government position on this fiscal lock nothing be either lock in or lock out by the bill the obr can not stop any budget or fiscal adjustment good bad or indifferent that be parliament role as other right hon and hon member have point out on second reading point that out to the minister who decline to concede on the absolute fact that the position be as have just set out hope he have have chance to reflect on the so call fiscal lock which be nothing more than an administrative assessment of treasury plan on which nothing be contingent the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy say that she be keen for those on the treasury front bench to be hold to high fiscal standard fair enough but the bill will not do that this be in abstract the narrow one dimensional protection from bad fiscal policy labour member be seemingly addicted the bill evidence this to some sort of pound shop exaggeration and troubling reliance on hyperbole when detail something profoundly ordinary the fiscal lock and the bill will not protect the devolved nation and their budget from the austerity of the labour front bench before the general election when labour in wales be face nhs budget pressure the now secretary of state say that all road lead to the tories and westminster in accordance with those budget pressure now after the election we have labour government the snp in scotland be face those same budget pressure and it be the snp fault they can not have it both way they have get the job and they need to own it the chancellor claim that the snp should raise income taxis to pay for her cut to the winter fuel allowance in scotland the cheek of it remind those on the treasury front bench that of taxis raise in scotland go directly to the treasury we have pay our due and shame on the chancellor for try to get scottish taxpayer to pay twice to compensate for her axe wield the double standard of it all be staggering she want the scottish government to raise income taxis in scotland which be precisely what she refuse to do ahead of the uk general election why will she not mirror the scottish government progressive income tax regime to increase taxis slightly on those of we who be well off and reduce taxis slightly for those on the low income that would raise nearly billion for the treasury if she have do that and follow the snp scottish government lead she would not have have to attack our pensioner winter fuel allowance significant element of budget responsibility be ensure that people own their decision and their own mess labour will find that snp members be keen to help they in that pursuit in summary there be nothing particularly to object to in this inherently ordinary and transactional provision in the bill except for the behaviour of the government advance it call will stone to make his maiden speech thank you ms ghani and congratulation on your position also congratulate my hon friend the member for portsmouth north amanda martin on her inspire speech feel like

cover the main urban area of the city of chelmsford it be bless with beautiful park and flank river that wind their way through the city centre pass the home of the essex eagles at the essex county cricket ground we have thriving high street that attract shopper from mile around investment into the constituency from the public and private sector mean that its future continue to look bright from waterhouse farm in the west to chelmer village in the east and from springfield in the northern reach to the southern boundary of goat hall and everywhere in between be proud to call chelmsford my home and even prouder to be stand here today represent its constituent in this magnificent place chelmsford have one of the busy two platform train station outside of london have now rejoin the rank of the commuter know at first hand the importance of the brand new station be construct just outside the northern edge of the constituency the new beaulieu park station will have significant positive impact on passenger from chelmsford give they more choice and flexibility and remove the need for many of they to travel into the city centre to commence their rail journey new station must not be see as job do however train travel in this country be expensive and complicated ultimately do not believe that the public care too much about who run the train they care more about how much rail travel cost they whether the train run on time and whether they be comfortable and efficient they be often frustrate by the bewildering array of ticket option whose detailed restriction seem design either to make they miss their train as they try to work out which one to buy or to make they buy the wrong ticket they be not design for the faint of heart or the novice traveller that seem like madness if we want to encourage more people to make use of public transport the whole system need to be simplify and be keen to see the legislation pass yesterday do just that without an economy that can support investment in new rail station or the redevelopment of junction include the major army and navy interchange in the centre of chelmsford we know that such project be in danger of never happen at all be pleased to support the bill before we today to ensure that the terrible wasteful fiscal mistake of previous government be not repeat leave more headroom for investment in our country future the new beaulieu park station be important to my predecessor vicky ford and pay tribute to her dedication to that project it be the culmination of more than decade of partnership work in chelmsford that vicky join after her first election to parliament in knock on door throughout this year campaign find that many constituent be grateful for her help with issue they have raise with she they also note her visible loyalty to her party as she be rarely see without her trademark blue nail polish to match her little blue car and an outfit that almost invariably include splash of blue thank she for the time she spend serve the chelmsford constituency from the very bottom of my heart thank the constituent of chelmsford who have place their trust in to represent they in this place know they do not do so lightly indeed it have take year of careful consideration for the good people of chelmsford to send to this place anyone other than conservative indeed it have be year since they make the choice to elect liberal to represent they that slow pace of electoral change in chelmsford may lead those not familiar with essex first city to conclude that chelmsfordians have little appetite for innovation but nothing could be far from the truth among other thing chelmsford have rich and distinguished history in the world of science and technology most notably it host the first ever entertainment radio broadcast in the united kingdom in from the marconi new street work right in the centre feature dame nellie melba that lead to regular entertainment broadcast from great baddow in the south of the constituency and eventually to what we now know as the bbc it be hard to spend much time knock on door in chelmsford and speak to chelmsford resident without come across someone who use to work for marconi its modern day successor teledyne locate little more than stone throw away from the site of the original marconi factory have more than take up the mantle of innovation in chelmsford many of my constituent be now employ there think of any space mission of the past few decade and the chance be that its imaging equipment contain component design and build by teledyne in chelmsford from nasa new horizons mission to pluto and the kuiper belt launch in to the plan launch of ariel by the european space agency to observe the atmosphere of thousand of planet beyond our own solar system teledyne and its employee be reach for the star that be what want everyone to have the opportunity to do to reach for the star to feel that sense of opportunity and to know that even the sky be not the limit but they can do that only if we invest and the very good place for that investment be in our child and young people we be lucky in chelmsford to have excellent school thank the teacher and other school staff who work so hard every day to give the child we entrust into their care the good possible start in life but they be increasingly do so with their hand tie behind their back with dwindle resource crumble building and ever great workload be the first in my family to go to university and the first elect to any public office let alone as member of this house have be able to achieve that because have have love and supportive family lot of incredible campaign volunteer and of course sizeable dose of luck but also know that critical part of my success be owe to the amazing state school education that receive the dedicated and inspirational teacher be lucky enough to be teach by throughout my school life and the extracurricular activity in my case largely music base that broaden my horizon and lift my eye to the star worry that that be not the overwhelming experience of those go through our education system today worry that child be go through the day with little or no food in their belly worry that school be have to cut club because they no long have the time or the resource to hold they and worry that the perform art such as music and drama have be see for too long by previous government as expendable and an unimportant luxury without recognition that they provide child with the skill and confidence to stand up on large stage dare say in parliamentary chambers and be hear if you be child with special educational need or disability well good luck with that because the system be utterly tragically devastatingly break but also take hope from the wind of change that blow just couple of month ago we know that there will be difficult choice ahead but my hope be that we recognise that invest early on and give child the good possible start can pay much great dividend in the future when guglielmo marconi bring his fledgling invention and experiment to the united kingdom in he do so because he believe that this be country that can see potential and will invest in that potential for the long term it pay off and whole industry grow from the humble beginning of short radio broadcast in the heart of my constituency whatever choice be make by the government in the loom budget it be my sincere hope that they recognise the importance of give school and teacher the resource they need to allow all child to reach for the star call bayo alaba to make his maiden speech commend the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman for great speech know chelmsford well it be beautiful town and commend her passion for support young people in school and their journey which be very important and something that we need to protect thank you ms ghani for allow today to make my first contribution in this house think it be right to start off by thank my predecessor as mp sir james duddridge for year of dedicated service he become mp in when southend east and rochford be newly redrawn the rural area to the north of southend have be bring back within the constituency for the first time in many year throughout many boundary iteration from southend east and rochford to rochford and southend east and back again you can see the creativity in rename the constituency the area have always be tory hold until now be particularly proud to speak here today as the seat first ever labour representative the constituency consist of not just the city of southend but the village of great wakering canewdon barling paglesham stambridge and shoeburyness the suburb of southchurch and thorpe bay and rochford itself it be beautiful constituency rich in culture where you should bring your walking boot as well as your swimming costume it be the place where dame helen mirren go to primary school and home to the cliffs pavilion which host oasis in that might be tricky next time round depend on who can get ticket as southender be contractually oblige to mention that southend be the site of the long pier in the world at metre with the option to walk or take purpose build train make the mistake some year ago of walk it with my son he be little bit old now and he be up in the gallery my calf be struggle by the end of it from watch the maiden speech of labour colleague past and present have be strike by the nature of the local industry that be so often name check tin pottery steel textile and coal be among the staple product in historical labour seat those be noble and important good they be labour good but they be not the stock in trade of my own seat southend primary industry and expertise have always be tourism good time escapism and happy memory those be our export southend be city that allow people to meet sea turtle admire vintage car win large teddy bear and even have their palm read often during the course of single day it be place where past generation have go in search of freedom and pleasure and it be hard in today world to think of call more important than that indeed the musician billy bragg immortalise one of the road that take people to southend in his song trunk road to the sea the chorus name check shoeburyness and bragg later say that he hop his song would imbue the know this be bit of reach with the same romance as route in america the road to your dreams which run from chicago to los angeles that be lofty lyrical ambition indeed and it be always go to be hard ask but speak as someone who grow up in the east end of london in that era can confirm that the idea of southend always carry certain magic that be one reason why feel so privileged to represent the area today another reason be the constituency military heritage at the eastern part of my seat we find shoebury garrison an area steep in military history and in the north be southend airport which now serve holidaymaker but in past life be rochford airfield fighter base that help to fend off fascism during the second world war as former soldier be station in the southend area for short while one of my great pleasure when canvass be run into old army friend still live in the seat if they be prepared to open the door to for as someone who leave school with no qualification get into lot of trouble as young boy and need second chance night school and the military provide lifeline quite simply would not be here today in the mother of all parliaments without the opportunity that give and the ethos of service that it instill in to properly understand southend we need to understand its proud military history the city be build on unique blend the discipline and the dignity of the armed force be combine with the creativity and the freedom of the art place for both the soldier and the singer if you like but there be risk of get too misty eyed coastal area such as mine have be on the economic sharp end for or year the root cause of that most notably be budget air travel and that be not go away recent year have bring fresh challenge southend economy be at the sharp end during the covid pandemic the city be still in its recovery phase many of the jewel in southend crown the kursaal venue on the seafront or the freight house in rochford remain unused or underused be determined that these building will come back to life again as part of our future believe that change be afoot there be southend renaissance at work the people of southend be ready to seize the initiative and want more southender be strong independent and unbelievably hard work this weekend we hold city jam an awe inspire international street art festival now in its third year but we can not do this alone that be one of the reason why be so pleased not just to be southend first ever labour mp but to be one of many first time labour mps in seaside seat that we have never win before seat such as southend east and rochford need real and impactful regional policy too little thought have be put into how we build on exist asset and specialism to create sense of place and an economic centre of gravity southend east and rochford future will be find in modern technology modern infrastructure and green energy by identify opportunity in well pay modern job sector we need year round economy not just seasonal one so that young people can move from seasonal work into well pay position simply put southend east and rochford will need to regain its cultural capital this be something have some experience in have be one of the creative pioneer of east london creative industry my wife debbie and my child be here in the gallery today and they have always be there for certainly during my career pivot from the creative industry into politic thank they for their unwavering support and complete belief in believe it be my duty to help shape and create the future job and business for this generation and future generation to grow into just like adebayo alaba and atinuke awesu do my late parent who sacrifice everything as part of the windrush generation to leave their family and community behind in nigeria in order to raise family here in one of the most welcoming country in the world simply put it be now my job to ensure that community such as southend east and rochford be vibrant dynamic stable and welcoming when we talk about the public finance as we be in committee today we should all bear that in mind our economy will be strong if we can fulfil the potential in every corner of the country include on the esplanade of southend and in the town centre of rochford and southend place that have so much to contribute to our economy and our culture yet too often have be sideline look forward to represent my constituent in this house look forward to contribute to future debate about our economic future and look forward to contribute to many other discussion call will forster to make his maiden speech thank you ms nokes for give this opportunity to make my maiden speech before do pay tribute to the hon member for southend east and rochford mr alaba who speak of his and his constituency proud military past be sure that he will see his constituency through these tough challenge and on to bright future it go without say that it be great privilege and an honour of lifetime to be here have be elect by the people of woking thank they for elect as their member of parliament however must begin by address the bill and the severe crisis face my local authority woking borough council despite be relatively small the conservatives leave woke with more than billion of debt follow risky investment decision this legacy be one of negative equity service cut and unsustainable debt repayment it could be argue that the conservatives in woking invent truss economic before the former right hon member for south west norfolk have her small stint as prime minister what have happen in my constituency show why the bill be so important fear that without support from the new government the situation in woking like the rest of local government will only worsen my constituent will suffer the most and that be unacceptable when it be not their fault urge the government to step in and provide the assistance we so desperately need to ensure that my community can recover and thrive most people might think of woking as modern constituency but it have rich history that stretch back through the century woking be mention in the domesday book sutton place famous for be the former home of paul getty date from and be one of the old unfortified house in the country woke palace now sadly ruin be royal residence for both henry vii and henry viii as result woke football club my local team be affectionately know as the cards after cardinal wolsey several act of parliament have have an especially profound impact on woking for example the basingstoke canal be authorise by parliament in the canal run through much of woke constituency it have shape our area and be popular cycling and walking route and haven for nature but like so many place in the country woke as we know it today be shape by the railway with steam stone and iron woking be cast into the proud town it be today in the we lay the foundation to become the great commuter town we be woke be also wonderfully diverse and welcome place home to the shah jahan mosque the old in the country vibrant muslim community have develop in the town as result more recently we have welcome ukrainian refugee and attend many event to support our new ukrainian resident with my predecessor our former mp jonathan lord that be powerful example of cross party co operation and thank jonathan for his service as woking mp especially on this humanitarian issue where there be no disagreement whatsoever although we be opponent at the last election wish he and his family well for the future woking mp before jonathan be humfrey malins who found the immigration advisory service in which to this day provide free asylum and immigration advice to those who need it he get cbe for his work woking have proud history of elect mp who welcome immigration and be pleased to follow that tradition our town be also know for its connection to mclaren it host its formula team and luxury car be build there be privileged to make visit only yesterday as young child of around remember watch with excitement as mclaren tour the town with its formula car drive by mika häkkinen to celebrate their success mclaren be win again much like the liberal democrats the town also take great pride in be home to the world wide fund for nature we have press issue such as sewage in our river and the fight against climate change be already work alongside the five other newly elect liberal democrat mps in surrey to hold thames water to account for sewage dumping in our local river and stream one of my first act as an mp be to bring all the surrey mps together to meet thames water to petition it for improvement and well service woking be fortunate to be surround by green space love walk my dachshund toffee on horsell common where hg wells famously land his alien in war of the worlds so it be not great surprise when ed davey liberal democrats turn up and start campaign with their out of this world stunt of course only would dare call my liberal democrat colleague alien get back to the matter at hand my constituency have much love local hospital woking community hospital despite feel like be bear and breed in woking be not actually bear in the constituency actually no one have be bear in hospital in woking for generation be bear in frimley park hospital one of the nearby hospital we depend on as woking lack maternity service however frimley park be plague with raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and its future be far from certain will work with my hon friend the member for surrey heath dr pinkerton to press the government for solution to rebuild frimley park hospital another major issue be the cost of rent and mortgage as someone under just understand these issue deeply they have be raise consistently by local people on the doorstep the increase cost of mortgage and rent in the past two year be further reason why the bill be so important my journey into politic begin because of surrey county council failure to protect vulnerable child at the time it be rat the bad county council in the country because of that failure we can not allow vulnerable child to be fail again the wide theme of why be elect and indeed why so many of my hard work liberal democrat colleague have be elect be that we understand our community local issue have work for year in local government and serve as deputy leader of woking council have see first hand the crippling issue that some council face when look at the face of the liberal democrat mps here see people who have work hard in local government for year what glorious theme for this new parliament cohort of who understand the local issue our community face and force for good in the country and in the chamber when we need it most call jake richards to make his maiden speech thank you ms nokes it be such great privilege to speak in this debate and make my maiden speech after the hon member for woking mr forster and for chelmsford marie goldman my hon friend the member for southend

the early hour of july which just happen to be my birthday we celebrate the end of year of conservative government and the first labour government of my adult life but we also humbly accept the responsibility that we have be give in the context of an often bitter and heated political campaign and from the thousand of value conversation have in my constituency one can not avoid the fact that we as country face daunt and urgent challenge we can not overlook the deep apathy towards the ability of politic and indeed this place to effect change there have be the rise of online disinformation blame bogeyman who do not exist conspiracy theorist and keyboard warrior purposefully ignore the complexity of the world around we for attention political culture too often thrive on division and controversy not the common good the hyperactive vitriolic politic see so often across the atlantic be seep into our discourse here undermine constructive dialogue there be an epidemic of alienation among our young people with level of self harm and suicide in my constituency increase all the time child be arrive at school still in nappy and too often without breakfast in their belly waiting list for mental health support now stretch to half decade with many young people reach their majority by the time they be see too many people in my constituency feel they have to leave their village or town to get on in life there be disillusionment that their home their community their place be no long offer the security and hope that people deserve there be fear for the future be tell so often during the election campaign what the point of politic this country be break perhaps some of those factor come to the fore over the summer recess when group organise to attend hotel just few mile from my constituency in wath plan to set that building on fire know full well there be innocent people inside the picture on our television be difficult to comprehend speak to young mother who have be make homeless and be be temporarily accommodate there with her child the terror she describe will haunt forever but from the gloom of that violent act come hope the day after the hotel be attack reach out to the muslim community in my constituency and be invite to meeting after evening prayer arrive eager to show solidarity but anxious about the fear and damage that the community would have suffer and yes there be plenty of concern but the first question encounter be not one of anger or retribution but instead comment urge to speak with the perpetrator of the violence in order to well understand the cause and motivation it be moment of great generosity and sensitivity and one that will always stay with indeed that spirit of togetherness care about the bond that unite we be everywhere to be see in the rother valley dinnington boxing club hold an event after the riot with several south yorkshire boxing club to show unity and togetherness determination to portray south yorkshire in different light that spirit run through the club will always recall have pint at the little mester in north anston when young lad from the club arrive to rapturous applause only to explain that he have casually run marathon that morning on his own wholly unorganised to raise money for local child hospice he have hear that it require more fund for toy think of the dementia café in winthrop gardens which provide such an invaluable service or the maltby lions who be out every week rain or shine to raise money for deserve cause think of the community café at the beautiful ulley reservoir the work of the salvation army at the dinnington food bank the community fridge in kiveton park the volunteer gardener in harthill the community energy project in woodsetts or the macmillan coffee morning in anston this spirit ultimately win the day even in the shadow of horror in previous life as pupil barrister sit behind prosecute counsel at the trial of the murderer of jo cox mp learn an

this house promise will work as hard as can to bring prosperity and happiness to our town and will not let they down pay tribute to the hon member for dudley sonia kumar for her excellent maiden speech indeed we have hear more than half dozen excellent maiden speech today several of which touch on the climate crisis and the future of child in our country theme that relate to my amendment be touch to hear the passion with which all the new members speak about their experience and commitment my amendment require the obr to report on the impact of fiscally significant measure announce by the government on the uk statutory net zero target the justification for my amendment be that we simply can not separate the economy and the climate they be interlink to deliver the green economic transformation that we so urgently need as reference by hon member speak early every single policy must be align with the uk net zero target and every government spending decision should be as well it make sense to increase the obr remit on net zero to specifically consider the impact of climate risk on economic stability and how far policy introduce at fiscal event will reduce or increase these risk fiscal event namely budgets and spending review lock in what be happen in our economy for year to come even generation so it beggar belief that they be not properly take account of climate impact whether those policy be spend on new road subsidy and tax break for oil and gas investment in renewable infrastructure or giveaway like freeze on fuel duty they all have direct impact on the uk prospect of meet our net zero target those impact should be make clear and consider explicitly in the policy make paper we need to be think about the impact of today economic policy on the prospect for future generation the cost of fail to take an approach that consider climate impact be eye watering report by the grantham institute find that climate change damage to the uk be project to triple by and more than double again year later so climate prudence and fiscal prudence be one and the same thing give that the obr main duty be to assess the health of the uk economy and the sustainability of its public finance it need to be charge with assess whether fiscal event be reduce or increase climate risk to the economy bring net zero into the obr mandate be consistent with the government five mission indeed in announce its clean energy superpower document labour say that it will add net zero mandate to all relevant regulator that need it would argue that the obr be relevant regulator that need net zero mandate that be why be propose this probe amendment today as other member have mention it would also represent increase transparency around how fiscal policy choice be impact the uk progress towards our net zero target and help ensure that future government also consider that it be also an important step stone towards net zero test which would assess the aggregate climate and nature impact of every fiscal event again this be something that labour commit to in opposition in his wind up remark will the minister comment on whether he be able to ensure that this test be integrate into the legislation that he be propose hope that labour will use this opportunity to commit publicly to introduce net zero test in government and will take step towards do that by back my amendment call lauren edwards to make her maiden speech thank you for give the opportunity to speak madam chair pay tribute to the many hon member who have give such impressive maiden speech today it be an honour to follow my hon friend the member for dudley sonia kumar who give such passionate speech about her constituency and who certainly do her family very proud although she have leave her place may also commend the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman for her excellent speech which as somebody bear in australia particularly appreciate for its reference to the australian opera singer dame nellie melba financial market stability and public trust in announcement on fiscally significant measure be funnily enough not issue that come up regularly on the doorstep but the real life consequence when these two important pillar of our society be lack be central to the recent conversation that have across rochester and strood the cost of living pressure already challenge for most be heighten as family find that they have to pay on average hundred of pound more just to put roof over their head the cause of that additional pressure the former truss government mini budget be deeply undesirable situation that this bill seek to prevent from ever happen again one reason give for the adverse market reaction to that mini budget be the lack of forecast by the office for budget responsibility an omission which in turn contribute to lack of investor confidence in the plan political party whatever their colour can have the good policy in the world but if they be not back with economic competence and market confidence in those who be hold the purse string no one will be well off for they we can not and should not play fast and loose with the economy so like many other take great comfort from the bill that include the chair of the obr himself robert hughes who say that the bill will address gap in the current law and serve to strengthen the legal foundation for fiscal management it be surely only right that policymaker when make major fiscal decision base those decision on up to date economic and fiscal outlook publish at the same time to give maximum transparency dwell so much on economic stability as view it as necessary precondition for economic growth this government chief mission and because in recent year there have not be enough focus on the latter in place such as medway be immensely proud to call rochester and strood my home and honour to have be give the opportunity by its resident to represent they here in this place will work hard every day to

deprivation in the constituency not enough good quality and affordable housing an overburdened hospital and not enough infrastructure include health service public transport and banking service to

crucial first step to achieve it be to deliver economic stability we have see what happen without stability at the conservative mini budget huge unfunded fiscal commitment be make without proper scrutiny and key economic institution such as the office for budget responsibility be sideline that be why we have make commitment in our manifesto to fiscal lock that will strengthen the role of the obr and why we have take quick action to deliver on that commitment that will reinforce credibility and trust by prevent large scale unfunded commitment that be not subject to an independent fiscal assessment and prove that we be responsible government who will not play fast and loose with the public finance as the previous government do the bill set out the legal framework for the operation of

upcoming update to the charter for budget responsibility draft of which the treasury have publish to support scrutiny of the bill today will now talk through the bill two clause the first be the main substantive clause set out the operation of the fiscal lock it introduce new section into part of the budget responsibility and national audit act which relate to budget responsibility and be use to legally establish the obr clause make five key change first new subsection of section guarantee in law that from now on every fiscally significant change to tax and spending will be subject to scrutiny by the independent obr it will require that before government minister make any fiscally significant announcement to parliament the treasury always request that the obr prepare an economic and fiscal forecast this build on exist legal framework require the obr to produce at least two forecast per year importantly the obr assessment should include the extent to which the government be meet their fiscal mandate that requirement apply when two or more announcement be make and the combination of measure be fiscally significant irrespective of whether the measure be announce at the same time it will also apply separately to cost and saving so that those can not be offset against each other new subsection strengthen the role of the obr by require it to produce an independent assessment if it judge that the fiscal lock have be trigger if fiscally significant announcement be make without the treasury have previously request forecast the obr be require to inform the treasury committee of this house of its opinion and then prepare an assessment as soon as be practicable new subsection define measure or combination of measure as fiscally significant if they exceed specified percentage of gdp in line with the exist legal framework the precise threshold will be set via an update to the charter for budget responsibility draft of which will be publish on the threshold level itself will be set at announcement of at least of nominal gdp in the late forecast as an example this year that threshold would be billion new subsection ensure proper scrutiny of the government fiscal plan without prevent they from respond to emergency such as the pandemic it set out that the fiscal lock do not apply in respect of measure that be intend to have temporary effect and be in response to an emergency the charter will define temporary as any measure that be intend to end within two year to safeguard against this subsection be use to avoid proper scrutiny as set out in the update charter the obr will have the discretion to trigger the fiscal lock and prepare report if it reasonably disagree finally new subsection prevent any future government from choose to ignore the fiscal lock by simply update the charter for budget responsibility alongside fiscally significant announcement it achieve this by require the government to publish any update to the detail of the fiscal lock such as the threshold level at which it be trigger at least day before the update charter be lay before parliament clause set out when the bill will come into force and to whom it apply subsection confirm that it deal with reserved or excepted matter and that its provision extend and therefore apply to england wales scotland and northern ireland subsection and allow for the commencement of the legislation to occur at the appropriate time as be usual practice we expect this will take place ahead of the upcoming budget on october will now turn to the amendment that right hon and hon member have table before my right hon friend do so will he give way briefly yes be this bill not design to prevent the recklessness of the previous tory government who effectively crash the economy leave this new labour government with the responsibility of put thing right my hon friend have hit the nail on the head indeed might go so far as to say that that be one of the reason we achieve such large mandate at the last general election with so many hon friend on the government benches we will never play fast and loose with the economy as member on the conservative benches do and this bill will prevent that from happen again in the future start with amendment and table by the shadow chancellor they would require the obr to publish report whenever his majesty treasury announce new fiscal rule the purpose of the bill be to ensure that no government can make large scale announcement of tax and spending without be subject to independent assessment the government robust fiscal rule will support economic stability but do not change tax and spending it be those decision that matter as we see when the previous conservative government announce billion of unfunded commitment in the mini budget will the minister give way briefly the minister can answer this briefly as well could he confirm that he have no plan to change the fiscal rule the hon gentleman be enjoy himself but he know the answer wait for the budget the amendment from the official opposition be therefore not necessary to answer the question from the shadow financial secretary the hon member for droitwich and evesham nigel huddleston as have be invite to do so the chancellor have already confirm that the government will set out the precise detail of our fiscal rule at the budget on october alongside an update obr forecast amendment and table by my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy focus on the definition of fiscally significant measure to which the fiscal lock will apply they would extend the definition to include measure that have cumulative effect on public sector net debt or contingent liability welcome my hon friend highlight this issue on which know she have work for many year the draft charter text state that measure will trigger the lock when the combine costing be at least of gdp in any year and specifically the costing of measure be the direct impact of policy decision on the public finance it be difficult to set and interpret threshold consistently for contingent liability as they can often be large in maximum exposure but low in expected or reasonable bad case loss effective management of contingent liability be important and transparency be key to good fiscal management the government plan to announce new significant contingent liability at fiscal event to make sure there be transparency with parliament we will of course continue to notify parliament of new contingent liability as set out in manage public money the amendment would also place condition on policy with cumulative impact on public sector net debt and my hon friend note public private partnership as an example she be refer to pfi and model which the previous government have no long proceed with and there have be no change to this policy as the chancellor say in her mais lecture early this year we will also report on wide measure of public sector asset and liability at fiscal event to ensure transparency across the whole balance sheet which include non debt liability report transparently on the government stock of contingent liability be key to ensure we do not take excessive risk can therefore confirm today that the government will publish report on our contingent liability expect the contingent liability central capability to do this in early have say all that recognise the issue my hon friend raise and will arrange to meet she to discuss they far move on to the liberal democrat amendment amendment be table by the hon member for richmond park sarah olney as she say it would enable the obr to notify the independent adviser on ministers interest if the fiscal lock be trigger remind hon member that the purpose of this bill be to ensure that never again do we find ourselves in situation like at the liz truss mini budget in which fiscally significant measure be announce without accompany obr analysis if future government be to act in this way the bill provide clear remedy the obr be empower to independently notify the treasury committee and to produce its own report this would be available for full scrutiny by stakeholder and parliament which would be able to hold ministers to account in the normal way we therefore do not consider the amendment necessary amendment also table by the liberal democrats would broaden the definition of fiscally significant measure to cover anything that be likely to have an impact on the cost of government borrowing interest rate or economic growth the bill be focus on prevent irresponsible large scale fiscal announcement that could undermine macroeconomic stability such as at the mini budget to support that we need clear and robust legal framework that ensure the provision be trigger only when appropriate this require precise definition that everyone include the obr in particular can understand clearly and work with practically it would therefore not be helpful in the government view to have broad vague definition that might repeatedly trigger the fiscal lock under many different circumstance amendment and would require the treasury to consult the obr and the treasury committee before the charter can be update for the purpose of the fiscal lock and to publish report on the outcome of any such consultation it be of course important that the view of the obr and of parliament be take into account when make change to the charter however hope the hon member will accept that it will not be necessary to set out this specific process in primary legislation because the bill already include an important safeguard on the fiscal lock which be the requirement that any change to the charter for budget responsibility be publish in draft at least day before they be lay in the commons that will ensure that the obr the treasury committee this parliament and all stakeholder will have clear opportunity to make representation to the treasury and to publish their view as they see fit amendment table by the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns would require the obr to take net zero target into account when prepare report on fiscally significant announcement strong legal framework be already in place in the climate change act to support the transition to net zero in the act legislate for interim five year carbon budget and require the government to report on those periodically parliament and its select committees already scrutinise that in great detail the green book the treasury guidance on how to appraise policy project and programme require departments to assess the climate and environmental impact of policy proposal with major bid and proposal at fiscal event be assess accordingly in that way we therefore do not consider the amendment to be necessary do the minister agree that have commit to give net zero mandate to all relevant regulator the obr be indeed highly relevant regulator and it be equip to do the job it be suppose to do alongside the other regulatory body that hold the government to account the committee on climate change in conclusion hope have be able to provide some assurance and that hon member will be content to retract their amendment if not urge the house to reject they thank other member for their contribution to the debate gently invite the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith to reflect on his own party record in crash the economy through unfunded tax cut lose control of public spending and ruin family finance before offer advice to this government on fiscal responsibility say to the snp spokesperson who be not in his place that be surprised to see so many discredit conservative party line to take in his speech who know that the snp and the tory party be one and the same thing with this labour government our commitment to fiscal discipline and sound money be the bedrock of all our plan the bill will guarantee in law that from now on every fiscally significant change to tax and spending will be subject to scrutiny by the independent obr that deliver on key manifesto commitment to provide economic stability and sound public finance by strengthen the role of the independent obr that be crucial first step to achieve sustained economic growth and commend the bill to the house call shadow minister nigel huddleston will not detain the house long by repeat the argument that make in my opening comment but be disappoint by the minister response and in particular by his refusal to accept our amendment it be alarming that he be refuse to do so because as outline believe they be consistent with the goal of the bill overall and think the credibility of the bill will be seriously undermine if it do not include the fiscal rule like the minister lot we go back way and have always have civil conversation but if he do not believe or consider the level type and definition of debt to be fiscally significant then with the great respect perhaps the treasury be not the right home for he they be transparently fiscally significant and an important part of the consideration we be talk about today thank the hon gentleman for give way and for invite to suggest whether should try to find job in another department just point out that have arrive at the treasury have see the impact of fiscally significant level of debt after year of the conservative government have he get anything to say to the house on that matter yes have indeed as outline in my original statement the argument the right hon member be make do not stack up with the fact the economic circumstance that labour inherit be well in many area than those we inherit from they back in the economy be the fast growing in the on unemployment every labour government since the second world war have increase it while in power for we to then clear up and reduce it when we take over inflation be low when labour take power then when we inherit it and annual debt be high when we take over in labour member keep say all those thing but the challenge be that it do not stack up with the fact they make argument about the level of debt as outline early but they have already announce billion for inflation bust salary increase for their union mate billion on energy provision and billion on the national wealth fund that be billion of additional money that they have spend if there be black hole in the finance it be clearly one of their own making by the announcement they have make since come into government that billion be huge amount of money but will finish discuss those point because we have this debate early rise will not give way at the moment because want to move on to some more positive thing there be load of time we have third reading as well so let we enjoy ourselves just because the government keep repeat the narrative do not make it true be sure they will continue to do so but the billion of additional spending that have just outline be choice they have make the argument they be have to make that they be have to cut payment to pensioner in response to the circumstance they have inherit be not true because as outline in my opening speech it be deliberate long state policy choice articulate by the current chancellor decade ago it be not response to circumstance but deliberate labour policy on more positive note congratulate all those who have make their maiden speech today the hon member for loughborough dr sandher for portsmouth north amanda martin for swindon north will stone for chelmsford marie goldman for southend east and rochford mr alaba for woking mr forster for rother valley jake richards for wokingham clive jones for dudley sonia kumar for rochester and strood lauren edwards for plymouth moor view fred thomas and for northampton north lucy rigby they have make incredible contribution the breadth of experience that they bring to this parliament be astounding and be largely talk here about government members say it with great degree of respect because in many circumstance in fact in nearly every single circumstance they have replace good friend of mine who contribute significantly to this house they all have big shoe to fill but what they have say today be impressive in particular those who speak without note be lesson to we all what beautiful tour we have around the united kingdom everyone who speak today speak eloquently about their constituency and their constituent and showcase their rich heritage and rich history it be incredibly impressive be sure their constituent will be proud of what they have say with that will finish my comment but the debate will continue question put that the amendment be make stuart andrew edward argar victoria atkins gareth bacon kemi badenoch harriett baldwin

members have show they be not serious about our public finance what be they try to hide it be clear that the purpose of the bill be to distract everyone from labour economic record and pave the way for tax rise in the autumn budget let we examine labour economic record the party have be in government for just nine week and have already carry out nine act of economic vandalism it have remove the winter fuel allowance from million pensioner despite promise not to cave in to its union paymaster by agree inflation bust pay rise fail to commit to invest of national income on defence cancel vital

economic vandalism we know there be more harm to come with labour autumn budget set to raise taxis during the election campaign labour promise over time not to raise people taxis but the labour government be plan to do just that it will be hard work people pensioner and business who will pay the price may invite the chief secretary to the treasury to return to the dispatch box to rule out raise taxis on work people such as driver saver and business owner at the same time will he rule out change the fiscal rule to allow for more government borrowing and debt always welcome the opportunity to return to the dispatch box and thank the shadow minister for invite to do so opposition provide an opportunity for reflection while he be offer his thought on our two month in office two month of great relief for the british people do he have anything to say about his year in office before the election think the answer from the chief secretary to the treasury be no which confirm

open the police station but not even fortnight after the general election be astonish to see for sale sign in front of our police station neither as the member of parliament member of the royal sutton coldfield town council nor any of our councillor be inform back in march there be promise by the pcc of consultation with our town council mr speaker have make it clear that he want to see great respect for politic and politician but how can that noble aim be achieve when we see this sort of cynical manipulative disregard of the wish of the local people by those elect to serve our interest have no doubt that some will argue that such decision be an operational matter for the police the whole point of police and crime commissioner be that they should represent the wish of local people and speak up for we in respect of police decision be member of the cabinet that introduce police and crime commissioner and have to say that in my view the jury be out on whether they have be successful reform to our law and order architecture if police and crime commissioner be capture by the local police establishment that reform be by definition failure they be mean to represent we to the police not the police to we they be our servant not our master do the right hon gentleman share my concern that in my constituency we do not have single publicly accessible police station they have be close under programme lead by our previous police and crime commissioner we have never have labour police and crime commissioner in staffordshire our police and crime commissioner have always be conservative would the right hon gentleman hold my commissioner accountable for those closure in the same way that he seek to hold his commissioner accountable for his the hon gentleman must as he be champion the interest of his constituent as he see fit but be very glad to hear that he have conservative police and crime commissioner do not know whether he still do but if he do be sure that they will serve the community extremely well on the subject of consultation the perfectly fair and legitimate request by myself and the leader of the royal sutton coldfield town council mr simon ward for the police and crime commissioner to come before the town council and answer question from the councillor and public have be turn down instead he want behind close door meeting with the leader of the council and couple of other councillor no we want genuine public consultation transparency not behind close door private meeting fully understand the need for value for money and that the royal sutton coldfield police station be at present inadequately use indeed for many year at christmas visit our local police station to dispense house of commons fudge and humbug to the hard work officer and staff who work there over recent year the consumption of fudge and humbug have diminish as resource have be take away from the station but instead of denude police service from significant location in key strategic part of the west midland to the north east of birmingham the police service should be look at base far more of the service that describe early in strategic hub build on the advantage of significant space in sutton coldfield rather than try to flog it off our police station be once an operational command unit for the west midlands police which now look set to be reduce to refit of three small dilapidate semi detach house what contrast to the brilliant west midlands fire service which have invest in its strategic location in the royal town adjacent to the police station before anyone suggest that this be all down to the wicked tories mercilessly cull budget consider these four fact funding for the west midlands police have be increase by nearly million take the annual police budget to million we have recruit an extra police officer we have invest million in violence reduction unit in the west midland to tackle the most devastating crime and put the bad criminal behind bar and we have invest million in the west midland through the safe street fund during the course of the campaign to save the police station have have the benefit of advice from several former west midlands police officer responsible for police in the royal town thank they for their year of diligent service and for their insight and advice they tell that they be totally opposed to the closure of the police station and that this be their professional opinion and advice they make it clear that they oppose the loss of significant visible deterrent and the easy access to fast redevelop town centre with the recent reopening of the royal cinema probably the fine boutique cinema anywhere in the uk and the purchase of the gracechurch shopping centre as well as the million of pound of investment secure under the previous conservative government all that add to the case for more policing in sutton coldfield the loss of our police station will mean significant reduction in service and diminution of policing the loss of the custody cell currently mothball come at time when we have see from the recent disgraceful rioting and demonstration that circumstance could arise where there would be strategic need for such thing those regionally strategic facility should not easily be disregard it be not that long ago that the expensive facility be provide indeed think perform the opening ceremony that strategic point be at the heart of the intervention from my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton who rightly talk about the importance of strategic location north east of birmingham serve both my and her constituent my right hon friend be so right to make that point he demonstrate that police station be integral to our community but with the potential loss of the sutton coldfield station and aldridge under threat what do that leave we with strategically on the eastern flank of the west midland at time when we know resource have be increase in the case of aldridge police station if we lose the base we lose the base for our police officer as well this should not be about brick or bobby it should be about both and make sure we have strong police presence in our community once again my right hon friend put her finger on the critical point and underline the case that she and be make for the good policing of our constituent the sale of our police station will realise million of pound much of which will clearly not be spend in sutton coldfield in its place we be offer low grade option for police with very limited facility sell short the people of sutton coldfield at well small public contact centre comprise three small police house to the rear of the exist station that be clearly wholly inadequate marginal replacement for proper police station it be measure design to save money and not to enhance policing it be well know that policing be local or it be nothing and the propose closure take the local out of police in the town the motto of the west midlands police be forward in unity this decision take we backwards in great disunity the pcc proposal have be strongly condemn by resident former police officer all elect conservative councillor senior figure throughout the local community and by as their mp pay particular tribute to the vigorous campaigning and eloquent argument put forward by simon ward the leader of royal sutton coldfield town council and his hard work councillor by our energetic local birmingham city conservative councillor include the highly effective david pears and by jay singh sohal former police and crime commissioner candidate with immense experience of police issue however those be but the tip of huge local campaign vigorously support and engage in across my constituency on the day of the disastrous announcement of the sale of the police station receive letter in the post from the pcc not address the press matter but instead discuss his hope on matter such as community police for community police to be effective it must take advice from the community it hop to police and protect and not press ahead without consult that community with decision such as this pay such little regard to local opinion and safety requirement it can not be surprise that west midlands police be place under special measure under the labour police and crime commissioner until he start work alongside local community instead of dictate to they the fate of key service such as the police station thing may only get bad the decision to close the royal town police station be mistake urge the labour police and crime commissioner to reconsider his stance and to engage with humility rigour and energy in proper public consultation with the local people whom he serve so that he can listen to their concern directly and honour the west midlands police mantra of forward in unity my right hon friend be be very generous on the subject of engagement it be high time that the labour police and crime commissioner engage fully with we on aldridge police station and come clean about his intention want to make sure that he be leave in no doubt that my right hon friend and will continue to fight tooth and nail for these vital service that our community deserve it be wrong as be sure my right hon friend agree that resource be all too easily direct to other part of the west midland particularly to lloyd house when we have need in our community as well must draw my remark to close so that we can hear from the minister on whose appointment wish belatedly to congratulate she but my right hon friend once again make critical point about consultation on these decision as have say the whole point of have police and crime commissioner be that they should listen to their local community and represent their heartfelt view hope that by listen to what my right hon friend and and so many other be say in our respective area the police and crime commissioner will have another look at this matter and see what he can do to satisfy we on vexed subject that have cause enormous local anxiety fear and pain about such sharp diminution in the police resource that we all wish to see congratulate the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell on secure this debate it be pleasure to see he back in his place after the general election know that he have very long stand interest in this issue and commend he on take the necessary step to secure this debate think he first raise this subject in if my record be correct as come through in his very powerful remark the subject of the debate be very important to he and to his constituent be very grateful to the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton and my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell who make intervention will state at the outset that as constituency mp fully appreciate that the status of police station can be the focus of significant attention and generate strong feeling in community of course be not as familiar with development in the constituency of the right hon member for sutton coldfield as he be he will also understand that in the main we be talk about decision and consideration that be not within the direct purview of central government and myself as the minister for policing indeed he admit that he be part of the government who introduce police and crime commissioner to give that accountability at local level remind he that we have election for police and crime commissioner early this year in which the police and crime commissioner for the west midlands be elect on his own mandate say this not to try to minimise the matter at hand but simply to set out the context of my response stress the general importance of strong local police presence before come on to the particular situation in the right hon gentleman constituency will make general point about this government recognition of the importance of police force have strong local footprint think we would all acknowledge that technology have change the way that the vast majority of we communicate and interact with the world and it be therefore right to have range of mean by which people can contact and engage with the police include online and by telephone but these channel should not be see as substitute for physical police presence such as that provide by police station none of we would wish to see the possibility of go to local police station to get assistance or to speak to an officer consign to history and it be important for many of our constituent know that the focus of this debate be very specific but will make two broad point first the government need no reminder about the importance of that strong local police presence in community after all it be this government who have commit to restore neighbourhood police in all our community so that people feel confident that they be be protect and our law enforce secondly member will be aware that police force be operationally independent from ministers and government and that be absolutely as it should be it mean that the democratically elect police and crime commissioner and the operationally independent chief constable be responsible for take decision on police station and their whole estate in do so they will use their judgment local knowledge and expertise to ensure that the use of their estate give the good service to the community and fulfil value for money obligation know that the right hon gentleman will be concern about get value for money let turn to royal sutton coldfield know that the police station have serve the town for many year since as understand it the police and crime commissioner office have confirm to directly and to my official that although the police station be currently list for sale as the right hon gentleman mention it remain operationally open and with police access as normal new police station locate on anchorage road immediately adjacent to the exist building understand the distance between they be yard have be confirm as the new police station site by the police and crime commissioner it be small hear what the right hon gentleman say but understand that the current building be occupy at only mean that of it be not occupy at the moment which do not seem to be value for money the small police station will be more modern and more appropriately sized for the local presence base on the current level of occupancy and it be expect to be ready to move into next year the police and crime commissioner have already publicly commit to the new station house the response team the neighbourhood police team and the criminal investigation team and it will be open to the public furthermore ownership of the current police station will be retain until the new police station be open it have also be confirm to that there will be no disruption or break in the public access to the police interruption the right hon gentleman look like he want to intervene so happily give way be extremely grateful to the minister for give way completely agree with and accept lot of what she say prior to her last point the burden of the case that and my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton have be make be that more resource should be put into the exist police station which be underuse as the minister rightly say the police should not be sell it they should be reinforce it with service that be need not just in the royal town but regionally the three dilapidated house at the back will in no way whatsoever provide full police perspective of the sort that the royal town and adjacent area should get there be no comparison between what be propose in spite of the language that the minister have receive from the police and crime commissioner and what exist at the moment we be argue that strategic increase in service should be put into the exist building which as she rightly say have serve the town and the area since will she perhaps reflect back to the police and crime commissioner the importance of engage with the local community in way that he have not which would be good both for the position of police and crime commissioner and for the local community the right hon gentleman make his case and be sure that the police and crime commissioner will have hear it far understand that there have be an offer which think the right hon gentleman refer to to have that meeting with the police and crime commissioner to discuss the option and what he be plan to do can also gently say as do at the beginning of my remark that it be for the police and crime commissioner and the chief constable to decide how good to use the asset available to they understand that the chief constable be absolutely committed to this new way of provide the police station in this area operationally that be what he believe be the good way of provide police to the right hon gentleman constituent before finish want to take the opportunity to express my gratitude and thank to all our serve police officer police community support officer and special be sure that all member of the house will agree that they do an amazing job in very difficult circumstance particularly over the past few week when we have see disorder on our street as have set out and try to explain to the right hon gentleman decision about police station be ultimately matter that sit outside my remit as minister in any event hope that it have be helpful to have this discussion this evening and to talk through some of the issue have set out the government commitment to ensure that we have strong visible neighbourhood policing offer in all our community which be central to what this government will deliver through our safe street mission again thank the right hon gentleman for raise this important issue on the floor of the house this evening along with other right hon and hon member question put and agree to house adjourn
