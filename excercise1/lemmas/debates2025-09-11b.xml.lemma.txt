be delighted that he have not have to shred his own reputation like his ministerial and cabinet colleague have have to do on the broadcast round over the course of recent day include this morning in try to defend lord mandelson and the lack of judgment show by the prime minister do not know what it be about the decade of scandal and be good friend with notorious child trafficker and paedophile

service worker in new york who come to the aid of people many of they be still pay the price today lot have change in politic in the past year one of the motivation that get into public life be about the lack of accountability that we see from senior ministers when the conservative party be in government their failure to resign when scandal come up and the failure of front benchers to take action

have to wait to be tell what to do by morgan mcsweeney who be go to be the new ambassador and how quickly will the new ambassador be appoint at this absolutely critical time when russia be test the defence of nato country and we be show such weak response the hon gentleman who be sure have visit our embassy in washington on many occasion will know that we have an excellent and dedicated team

member if you be go to mention another member do they the courtesy of ensure that they be first make aware of the fact on the foreign affairs committee we have see the high calibre of career diplomat who usually take up the most senior ambassadorial appointment so it be not obvious to why the british ambassador to the united states be former mp in the email that have leak overnight it appear that lord mandelson think that to govern be to schmooze he famously declare in an election victory speech that he be fighter not quitter yet he urge the convict paedophile jeffrey epstein that to fight for early release be the right thing and lord mandelson do not do the decent thing and quit do the minister regret the original appointment the hon gentleman ask about precedent he will know that there be

be appoint in the first place that be gross error of judgment and everybody in this house know it and the prime minister have to take responsibility now that lord mandelson have go will there be cabinet office inquiry into the manner in which mandelson be negotiate with convict paedophile while he be minister the right hon gentleman will understand why will not comment from the dispatch box on his last remark what will say be that the prime minister have act decisively in the light of the new information and he have take the decision to ask the foreign secretary to withdraw lord mandelson as ambassador again for the house information the suggestion that jeffrey epstein first conviction be wrongful and should be challenge be new information the email show the depth and extent of the relationship be materially different from that know at the time of lord mandelson appointment again in the light of that and mindful of the victim of epstein crime he have be withdraw as

beginning it show that anybody who be brave enough to put themselves up for public service and try to change the world for the well face such danger and risk may ask the minister first to reassure we that we will have total transparency about the process that be follow in this ambassadorial appointment secondly assume we get over that hurdle can he please explain to the house why the appointment of man who describe president trump as danger to the world whom the americans describe as an absolute moron who have close link with china and who have history of misfeasance in public office be the right appointment for the relationship with the most important and powerful country in the world and one that be essential to this country on the hon member first comment he and fundamentally disagree on many issue but we know that we conduct our robust debate in this house in our medium and in our political society and we do not engage in any form of political violence what have happen in the united states over the past hour be simply appalling and our thought be with all of charlie kirk family and friend as somebody who work very closely with our late colleague jo cox and david amess it have shock to the core think it have shock all of we to the core and it can never be acceptable the hon member ask about the process and have be very clear all candidate for ambassador position be subject to extensive vetting and background check as matter of course and refer he to the formal process outline in the diplomatic service code assure he that we will keep the house update on these matter while the whole house welcome the withdrawal of lord mandelson as head of mission can the minister confirm whether he be still be pay as civil servant my understanding be that lord mandelson be still an employee and proper employment process will take place but will write to the hon member to confirm my answer to that question lord mandelson have recently be ask to withdraw as ambassador and will come back to the hon member with detailed answer but do not want in any way to inadvertently mislead the house on an important matter it seem that there be broad consensus across the whole house that this feel as though it be question of when not if so during the extended vetting procedure be there ever any interference or pressure from either no or the prime minister as the hon member will know simply be not go to go into the vetting procedure which be conduct independently he can certainly look at the detail of how vetting process be take in the diplomatic service code which outline the process the diplomatic service code state that diplomat behaviour action or inaction must not significantly disrupt or damage the performance or reputation of the diplomatic service it also state that diplomat must set out the fact and relevant issue truthfully and correct any error as soon as possible in the light of that do lord mandelson set out how many payment he have receive from the sanctioned russian oligarch oleg deripaska to account in this country switzerland or other area and have there be one set of rule for civil servant and another set of rule for friend of the prime minister and jeffrey epstein the right hon gentleman question get to the essence of the decision that have be take in the light of additional information in email write by lord mandelson the prime minister have ask the foreign secretary to withdraw he as ambassador to the united states the email show that the depth and extent of the relationship with jeffrey epstein be materially different from that know at the time of his appointment in particular lord mandelson suggestion that jeffrey epstein first conviction be wrongful and should be challenge be new information the right hon gentleman be well aware of the procedure and he know that do not have the document relate to the vetting process in front of on behalf of my party may convey my support to the hon member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson be in her company yesterday and she be very much in our thought also on behalf of my party express deep sadness at the assassination of charlie kirk year old conservative influencer who engage with young people across the united states of america know he be in heaven pray for his wife and child think we should all do that at time like this it be essential that we have an ambassador in place to convey our sincere sympathy with our ally the removal of peter mandelson be to be welcome in my humble opinion he should never have be in the post in the first place do the minister believe that it be imperative that we have an ambassador in place and that they must have adequate history and qualification rather than our have job for the boy mentality what change will the minister make to the appointment process to restore confidence in the role the hon member be rightly know as one of the kind and most generous member of this house thank he for his comment about my hon friend the member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson and the attack that she endure this morning wholeheartedly agree with his comment on charlie kirk he can be assure that we be already convey our condolence to the united states expect to be with the united states ambassador in london later today where will be able to do that in person from practical point of view as the hon member will know many ambassador or high commissioner post be vacant for time we have excellent team who then do that job of course when ambassador or high commissioner be travel there be team in post who be able to represent this country and ensure our that interest be pursue that be exactly what will happen in this case this be about the prime minister judgment by mandelson own admission there be more very embarrassing information come so the prime minister could have say to the house yesterday will suspend he pende further investigation but he do not he back he can the prime minister be sure that in make any trade deal or in any negotiation mr mandelson have not be compromise by the information that have now come forward and will he commit to investigate that bring the hon member back to the fundamental point which be that in the light of the additional information and email write by lord mandelson the prime minister ask the foreign secretary to withdraw he as ambassador associate myself with the minister word about and the untimely and tragic death of charlie kirk yesterday it be report that in lord mandelson email epstein and say that his conviction in the united states could not happen in britain and encourage he to go for early release the whole house can see that the prime minister have an issue when it come to judgment act only when he be push to by event in this house will there be an investigation of lord mandelson meeting while he be ambassador to see if there be any conflict with his current business interest will the government remove the whip from he in the house of lords yes or no and will lord mandelson be entitle to severance pay after this sack on the question about the whip as an employee of the foreign commonwealth and development office lord mandelson be on leave of absence from the other place so that be very clear as say the email show that the depth and the extent of lord mandelson relationship with jeffrey epstein be materially different from what be know about it at the time he be employ in particular his suggestion that jeffrey epstein first conviction be wrongful and should be challenge be new information and that be why the prime minister have ask the foreign secretary to withdraw he as ambassador to washington the prime minister be hide behind process yesterday and be do the same today do the prime minister know about these message before prime minister question yesterday be update the house in real time on action and decision that have be take have be very clear about the new information that have come to light and the decision that the prime minister have take as result the minister claim that new information have come to light which have result in the ambassador be sack can he confirm that this be the only new information and that all the other information be in the prime minister knowledge refer the hon gentleman to the comment have already make on point of order mr speaker the minister say that the only reason why peter mandelson have to resign be the additional information that he have campaign for the early release of epstein the government be not say exactly what they do or do not know at the point of appointment the only way for this house to know exactly what they know be for the government to publish the document relate to his vetting if the government will not publish those document as the minister say they will not would it be possible for this house to attain those document use the humble address mechanism that be not decision for the treasury have hear and if the minister wish to respond be more than happy to let he he be not go to rise be not go to continue the debate but will take point of order on point of order mr speaker would welcome clarity far on point just make the minister be ask on numerous occasion when the prime minister be make aware of the additional email information that lead to mr mandelson sack he have not provide the house with that information what avenue be available to we members to find out when the prime minister know this additional information the right hon member and party leader know very well the mechanism that he can use do not think that today be the end of the matter think this will be return to at some point in fairness to the minister he say that the house would be update as and when the government have the information the point have be take and expect the question to be answer at some time there be long weekend before we get to monday let we leave it there do not want to continue the debate on point of order mr speaker this relate to the issue we have be discuss but be about the house procedure what take from the minister answer be that lord mandelson member of the house of lords have not give full account of his past action while go through vetting process what disciplinary mechanism can be use by the lords to make he accountable for that if true have enough to do deal with the house of commons responsibility for the house of lords be not for and will certainly not take it life sciences investment urgent question to ask the secretary of state for science innovation and technology if she will make statement on the cancellation of life science investment start by welcome the hon member to her new role want to do that yesterday but time run away from we during question be answer this question on behalf of the secretary of state as significant life science company that employ more than people and play lead role in deliver new treatment for disease such as cancer merck know as msd in the uk be value partner to this government and key player in the life science ecosystem msd decision to not progress its investment in king cross commercial decision for msd be therefore deeply disappointing king cross be shin example of the strength of uk life science cluster it be one of the big in europe employ more than people in the area it have have investment from major life science company include novo nordisk glaxosmithkline and astrazeneca it house world lead institution such as the francis crick institute and the wellcome trust as well as some of the country lead biomedical research centre university college london hospital great ormond street hospital and moorfields eye hospital be also base there we be proud of this industry it have deliver great thing for our country in the past do so today and will continue to do so in the future that be why life science be one of the eight priority sector in the industrial strategy and be back by billion of public investment to enable it to grow lead the world and make great discovery such as personalised cancer vaccine and the new test for alzheimer disease msd investment in the area would have enhance the sector status far and the fundamental of the uk market be actually more advantageous today than when it make the decision to invest in this project what have change be the us and international fundamental the uk have become the most attractive place to invest in the world but of course there be still lot more for this government to do the academic environment in the uk continue to produce innovative idea and the talent to run with those idea which attract foreign investment the environment for research be outstanding we have great academic and the nhs provide research platform that be second to none the decision be in part due to broad effort by msd to ensure that the company be optimise its investment and focus its resource on its key driver of growth as such it be not continue its job discovery operation in the uk the company have recently announce in its quarterly report that it be to cut billion year from its operating cost result in significant impact on its share price that be compound by an ever more challenging and uncertain global economic situation as regard trade and tariff the problem with nhs medicine go back year wonder who be in charge over that period spend on nhs medicine have fall from to in that time and the last joint agreement on medicine price by the sector and the previous government be in we be live with the consequence of under investment by the previous government who take their eye off the ball when it come to nhs medicine investment my right hon friend the health and social care secretary make billion offer to the sector in the summer however the government also recognise that we need to do more to support and grow our life science sector we have already start deliver on the work of invest million in the health datum research service alongside the wellcome trust and be commit up to million for life science innovation and manufacturing unlock billion of pound we continue to work closely with the sector to unlock growth and ensure life change treatment and technology for this innovative sector msd will continue to be key investor in the uk welcome its continued investment in clinical trial and its significant partnership with our institution such as our future health msd will continue to employ people we remain closely engage with msd as we take forward the life science sector plan and the year nhs plan order say this gently as ministers be in new position but you be only allow three minute in an urgent question not the five minute you get for statement be sure that you be come to the end now minister thank you for your advice mr speaker be on my last sentence we will continue to explore opportunity to partner with msd far and build on our long stand relationship hope you will give the same flexibility if go little over my time mr speaker do count on it last night us pharmaceutical giant merck cancel the construction of billion drug research centre in the prime minister constituency eight hundred job that be go to be provide have now evaporate scientist be to be employ no long the message from merck executive be unspare simply put the uk be not internationally competitive the government must wake up now if astrazeneca announcement on investment be the canary in the mine for uk life science last night announcement should be klaxon sound across whitehall will the minister assure we that he be arrange urgent meeting with health business and treasury ministers today the facility be go to specialise in disease like alzheimer parkinson and multiple sclerosis it be go to feed into the work of cluster of life science body such as the francis crick institute do the government engage with merck before its decision what damage will this cause to research and medicine access for our constituent who be affect by those condition the government tell uk taxpayer that their devastating national insurance hike would boost the nhs but nhs leader admit that the money have go on national insurance wage deal and drug price inflation not well service and there be no money leave for negotiation with life science company in fact life science have face billion tax bill and real term cut to research and development what be ministers in the department for science innovation and technology do to push the health secretary for progress on health datum advanced therapy price negotiation and regulatory reform of the kind that will improve our life science offer for the last year labour have din out on deal secure by the last conservative government we be promise that us uk trade deal would open door for business instead american firm be cancel project and our ambassador who should have be bat for britain be battle for survival now that lord mandelson have slink away again who be speak to the americans about this collapse deal what will the prime minister be do ahead of president trump state visit to help uk life science welcome the minister to his place but where be the secretary of state in her very first week she have oversee billion investment collapse if she do not understand that this be the most important thing in her brief right now and if the government do not change course it will not be the last deal to collapse be grateful to the shadow secretary of state for bring the urgent question to the chamber as this be an incredibly important issue let answer some of the question think there be some question in there the shadow secretary of state ask what message america have give to the government but the message be from merck in its quarterly report just few month ago when it have to cut billion year from its operation that be significant amount of money and the company share price reflect the significance of that announcement there be no doubt that msd make the world most profitable and popular cancer drug which go out of patent in it say in the quarterly report that that be cause some pressure with its holder the us trade deal which the shadow secretary of state mention say that we would use good endeavour to improve the condition for us pharmaceutical company in the uk and the tariff for pharmaceutical company to the us remain at the eu have blanket tariff in term of nhs medicine it be common theme that shadow secretaries of state come to this chamber and bemoan the state of the economy and what have happen in the nhs waiting list be fall from the record level they be at satisfaction with the nhs when we leave government in be at its high level ever it be now at its low rise order we can not have point of order in the middle of the minister response they come at the end there be no doubt that spending on nhs medicine have fall from to which be part of the problem in the pharmaceutical industry my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care make billion offer to the pharmaceutical industry over the summer but it choose not to vote on that so he withdraw from negotiation we be try to clear up the mess that have be leave after year of conservative government the shadow secretary of state should realise that that mess be deep and wide and it will cause problem in the sector but as the health secretary have state number of time include when he make that billion offer he be try to resolve some of these underlying issue call the chair of the select committee welcome the minister to his place but wish it be under well circumstance the loss of merck investment follow the loss of astrazeneca investment in january will certainly be perceive as blow to the uk life science sector though we must not forget the amazing work that business start up and researcher do in constituency across the country include my own we also must not forget the importance of value for money in nhs spending the select committee will hold an urgent session on tuesday to examine the issue in the life science sector include tariff investment incentive from the us access to capital and the relationship with nhs pricing in the meantime it be clear that the life science sector plan publish in july do not reflect market condition could the minister update we on how and how quickly he plan to revise that plan thank the chair of the select committee for that constructive approach and look forward to the session on tuesday to examine this really important issue she mention the life science sector plan which be really important it come with significant investment in research and development improve clinical trial performance and move money and support from other key sector into the sector that be in the industrial strategy life science benefit from that there be billion year go into life science from this government and that contribute to the billion that the private sector invest every year as the chair of the select committee will know the chancellor give the most generous settlement for research and development ever in the spending review last year with billion over the spending review period that be to support the industrial strategy of which life science be key sector know from company in my constituency that the sector be grow and need more support and we be determined to deliver that call the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome the minister to his place it be incredibly disappointing that msd have pull out of this billion pound investment in the uk include the loss of more than job in important life science infrastructure however this have be on the card for some time and the warning to government have fall on deaf ear early this year astrazeneca also cancel plan upgrade to its production and novartis have describe the uk as largely uninvestable one pharmaceutical company reduce its uk operation be problem but there be worrying trend that threaten crisis in the sector the uk be become less and less attractive to the life science industry and with good reason first the budget see huge rise in cost to all business include through labour job tax secondly there have be notable lack of investment across the life science sector include in job creation critical skill and create commercial environment that can compete internationally the lib dems continue to call for the government to make research and development investment of gdp and the life science would be key focus that would be couple with extra support for academic institution to commercialise research how do the government plan to restore confidence among pharmaceutical company that the uk be competitive place for research and development and manufacturing be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise those point it be important to lay out to the public and to the house that msd will continue to employ people and be key part of the life science sector there be many company that be invest in this country moderna biontech isomorphic labs and in my own constituency roslin ct be expand at such great pace that it can not keep up with the amount of space and the wet lab facility it require those be all the challenge that we have to try and deal with gently say to the hon gentleman the second sentence of his contribution be about the national insurance increase for employer and the fourth be about spend more money on and life science they can not both be true if we want to spend money on our priority political party will have different priority we have to raise that money we can not have it both way the message to the industry be this be the good place in the world to invest bring your investment here and this government back you through an industrial strategy and life science sector plan welcome the minister to his place exeter have very strong life science and sector and just recently the university of exeter be award million from uk research and innovation to set up the metamaterial hub that be real cutting edge science which also leverage extra private sector investment of another million do the minister agree that that sort of investment and commitment to research and development will enable city such as exeter to thrive and grow in future pay tribute to my hon friend for his work with the university in his constituency in whole number of area all who represent university town do as well know that there be significant investment go into research and development and the life science because that be the future for this country this country be commit to growth and assure my hon friend that will do everything can in this role to ensure that we invest in that gently remind the house again that the spending review see the large ever settlement for research and development in this country at billion that say to the industry we be open for business come and invest here and put life science at the top of that investment discovery park in my constituency at sandwich be the phoenix that rise from the ash of pfizer it be now cluster of over enterprising and successful small company in the life science field the loss of cornerstone such as astrazeneca and msd could have devastating effect upon the architecture of the pharmaceutical industry in this country what be the government go to do practically to reverse the decline in confidence in that industry say to the right hon gentleman for whom have the utmost respect that in the first part of his question he quite rightly promote the wonderful work that be go on in his constituency at the discovery park and then say that everything be doom and gloom that be not the case this government be invest in research and development to the tune of billion we be invest in the life science it be one of the eight key sector in the industrial strategy and hope that the business park in his constituency benefit fundamentally from that merely repeat that msd be not leave the uk it will still employ people here and be the cornerstone of research in this country welcome the minister to his place this be devastating news for the research scientist and the fantastic work they do on neuroscience inflammation and immunology some of that be be carry out at the francis crick institute where declare be unpaid visit research scientist do the minister agree that the uk have so much expertise to offer and that he need to look at the whole life science ecosystem from bench discovery to dispense at the bedside will he join we at the science innovation and technology committee on tuesday afternoon when we can go into those issue in depth pay tribute to my hon friend for her work unpaid at the research institute it will be good to hear from she about what she see from inside the sector she raise think the most important point in any debate about science research and development and life science in particular in this country we have world class institution and company and they be make so by the world class scientist and academic that work within they we should cherish that we should grow it and we should have more at porton down in my constituency there be hub of life science business have listen carefully to what the right hon gentleman have say and recognise the difficult dilemma that all government have in where to focus investment however the minister must surely recognise that the additional cost of employ people with the additional right and burden that that put on employer particularly small employer plus week of speculation about further tax increase will not make any sector feel more comfortable about where to invest in this country the right hon gentleman be treasury minister so he understand some of the issue involve here would merely point he to the report msd release to its shareholder for the first quarter in which it say that it have to divest from billion year in operating cost that be huge part of its operating agenda it be geopolitical issue as well as commercial decision the minister will know that the part of london where msd be go to invest have receive significant investment for medical research particularly research of brain relate disease this decision cast doubt on the future of the great king cross area what be the implication of the decision to disinvest on that particular proposal which have cross party support at this stage be not aware that there will be any downside to the entirety of the ecosystem that revolve around the king cross area of london this decision have obviously come very late to the government and we will work with msd on the future however as we have hear from my hon friend the member for gravesham dr sullivan there be very bright future for this particular cluster and for all the other cluster we have hear about from other member across the chamber this morning for transparency should declare that be the director of the knowledge quarter partnership in king cross and cabinet member responsible for negotiate the msd headquarters deal it be disappointing news today turn to my current constituency hear from number of life science and pharmaceutical company that they have concern about the previous government levy under vpag the voluntary scheme for brand medicine pricing access and growth and how it be work in practice in particular that it be focus on revenue not profit and do not take into account the differential level of need celltrion south korean company in my constituency highlight that biosimilar medication require lot more investment than other form of pharmaceutical will the minister or his counterpart meet and celltrion to discuss the biosimilar sector and how we can support it to grow be grateful to my hon friend and would be happy to take he up on that meeting to hear about his experience directly he raise the big issue around the legacy leave by the previous government after year of underinvestment in medical pricing the health secretary make billion offer to the pharmaceutical industry over the summer which the pharmaceutical industry decide not to vote on so it be withdraw which be disappointing the last deal be do in under the previous government this be long term issue that must be resolve life science play significant role in the economy and public health initiative across the liverpool city region it be blow early this year when astrazeneca pull out of the million deal to expand its plant in speke how be the department support the liverpool city mayor and the life sciences investment zone to build confidence and secure great investment for the sector very simply the life science sector plan have be set out to give the industry certainty over the long term that this government be serious about the investment that both we and the industry will make in the sector with billion year from this government and at billion the large settlement for ever in the spending review hope that give reassurance to my hon friend constituent and to the life science company in her constituency and around the region that this government be serious about back they welcome the right hon member to his new role although admittedly be surprised that labour have adopt the fire and rehire strategy scotland have one of the high concentration of life science hub and in the past five year have create six innovation centre directly align to life science what assessment have the minister make of the impact of this announcement on scotland research and development sector and what support do he plan to put in place visit roslinct in my own constituency last friday the life science sector in scotland be indeed buoyant and flourish there be lot of opportunity for it to expand it be probably dividend of the union be very pleased that the minister have confirm and reiterate that the life science remain priority in the industrial strategy keele university in newcastle under lyme be at the heart of our life science sector which be particularly important for job and opportunity in the industrial heartland in community like mine so will the minister find time to meet to talk about how we can support the work at keele or even well will he get on the train to come and see we be very happy to do so think that be my third invite already this morning the question and the invite to newcastle under lyme demonstrate the thrive life science sector all across the country can give my hon friend an assurance that we intend to back the life science sector although the decision from msd in relation to their new building at king cross be incredibly disappointing the sector be thriving one and many company be invest and grow very quickly this be just the late in series of blow to uk life science company have be pull towards the us with incentive and tariff while we have no detailed industrial strategy an uncompetitive tax regime from the treasury and department of health and social care that undervalue drug access when the government announce their life science plan it fall short of what the industry and the sector expect so will the government commit to an update cross party refresh and give business the stability they need to invest in britain the hon member talk about yet more spending but with no idea of how the revenue would be increase this government have to make some incredibly difficult decision in order to balance the book to give that stability in the economy so that we could invest in include in the life science the nhs year plan be move from treatment to prevention which require medicine move from hospital to community which will require medicine and move from analogue to digital which will enhance and well target medicine for patient that be just one example of what we be do in the nhs to improve our life science sector it be key part of the industrial strategy one of the eight key sector and we intend to back it through the strategy welcome my right hon friend to his place also welcome my hon friend the member for glasgow south west dr ahmed to his place as life science minister in the department of health and social care be incredibly ambitious for the life science in my constituency of bracknell and across berkshire it be key industry for we will my right hon friend share my ambition and agree to meet or set up meeting with the life sciences minister to discuss what more we can do to support the sector in bracknell in the interest of time yes medical isotope be critical for the treatment of cancer for diagnosis and for other medical application yet there have long be concern about security of supply through project arthur advanced radioisotope technology for health utility reactor the welsh government be work with the nuclear license site at trawsfynydd in my constituency to develop the mean of produce medical isotope for security of supply here in the uk what be the minister department do to work with the department of health and social care to find way of bring that forward have just be work with the department of health and social care to try to bring that forward do not know the exact answer to the right hon lady question if know the answer would give it do not so will write to she welcome the minister to his place the life science sector be help to regenerate part of south birmingham economy from the new waters pharmaceutical factory on the old longbridge mg rover site in my constituency to the university of birmingham life science incubator the minister have be extremely generous in agree to meet members today so continue in that spirit would he be willing to meet south birmingham mps to discuss what more can be do to support this very important part of our local economy be tempt to say no just to see what reaction that get but of course will meet any hon or right hon member across the house to discuss the life science sector whether we be talk about the north south east or west include in my own constituency the life science play key role and will continue to do so must declare that my wife work in the pharmaceutical and life science industry the minister and the chancellor claim to want to boost growth yet investment be flee the very sector that he claim be priority be it not the case that the vague aspiration of the government do not meet the real world test and that the people who be go to suffer from this be his constituent and unfortunately mine congratulate the hon gentleman wife on what she do in the sector she be the only one in the family with real job that show the depth and breadth of the sector across the country everyone will know someone who work in it we have billion from the spending review go into research and development and billion back the life science sector plan economic and geopolitical issue be of course affect the pharmaceutical industry at the moment as say in my opening remark msd quarterly report say that it have to take billion out of operating cost over the next few year unfortunately and regrettably this decision be part of that plan represent people who work at the excellent living systems institute at the university of exeter the purpose build institute be launch in to bring together physicist mathematician biologist and biomedical scientist with the expectation that the life science sector be go to enjoy substantial foreign direct investment in the year to come what effect do the government anticipate the withdrawal of private investment for life science will have on research student include those at exeter would say to life science student in the fledgling part of their career that it be career they should be in for the long term life science be the future which be why it be one of the eight key sector in our industrial strategy the news the government have have today on msd commercial decision be incredibly disappointing but lot of wonderful stuff be go on in the sector so we should not talk it down moderna be invest more biontech be invest more isomorphic labs be invest more and roslinct in my constituency be invest more right across the chamber today we have hear about the company that be invest more in life science it be grow industry so say to fledgling academic and people who want to get involve in the industry get in there thank the minister for his answer think we be all seek reassurance in relation to the sector the news that msd have withdraw its plan for research centre in the united kingdom with the loss of potential job and staff be devastating for our science plan it show lack of faith in long term planning by the investor we be so reliant on how will the minister seek to reassure global partner that science investment be priority for this government will we see swift return of investment to the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland our workforce be the very good in the world and our world class institution be make world class because of that world class workforce this be the good place in the world to invest at the moment we be in discussion with the us in respect of the pharmaceutical industry and the tariff in the eu us economic deal lot of positive stuff be go on in the industry and if we be to send out one message to the industry from the house today it be that the industry be thrive it be one of the eight key sector in our industrial strategy and this government back it we be back it with money with our strategy and as whole government business of the house will the new leader of the house give we the forthcoming business welcome the new leader of the house and thank the previous leader of the house be look forward to this session probably more than be mr speaker laughter the business for next week be as

murder of charlie kirk in the usa and to our own great colleague the hon member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson for the terrible news she have have this morning thank the recently depart leader of the house the right hon member for manchester central lucy powell she and have our disagreement do not think there be much doubt about that she support the wrong football team and struggle to get she to answer my question but she be diligent and effective in respond to member across the house as well as in committee without get too teary about it will even miss her appalling pun but it be an ill wind that blow nobody any good hurricane tax dodge blow away the deputy prime minister and destroy the prime minister much vaunted phase two but it have bring we the former labour chief whip he be history teacher and there can not be many well form of public service than that after his distinguished career channelling industriously away in the usual channel warmly welcome he blink into the bright light of the dispatch box have somehow think that have plumb the depth of incompetence over the summer the government would now settle down bit how naïve how desperately foolish be the no team be obviously take the mickey they be laugh at we you think this be incompetent they say we have hardly get go we can do vastly well than that reset be for wimp let have full blow crash reshuffle let have new foreign secretary and home secretary as well as new deputy prime minister and let undermine the chancellor of the exchequer by ostentatiously line up the former chief secretary to replace she the market will really welcome that even well let have an election for deputy leader of the party people be already scared to death about all the taxis come in the budget but they will be completely reassure if we run labour leadership election at the same time ideally we can make the deputy leader former cabinet minister whom the prime minister have just abruptly fire that be good

commonwealth and development affairs and for business and trade to ask for important information about the legality of export we want that information ahead of ministerial appearance before the business and trade sub committee on economic security arms and export controls on monday this be important because the al haq judgment hand down by the court on june make it very clear that under our constitution the acutely sensitive and political issue of the legality of export be matter for the executive who be democratically accountable to parliament and ultimately the electorate and not for the court we have not have that information yet and the hearing be on monday what step can you advise to take to get the information that the committee need be grateful to the right hon member for

be fly in winter only small flag be fly can you please ask mr speaker to raise with the house authority why the large summer flag have be remove and replace by the small flag when last check british summer time do not end until october so surely the large union jack should fly at least until that date may also say that october be also essex day so maybe we can fly the flag of essex as well thank the hon gentleman for raise the issue of the flag fly from the victoria tower will ensure that his request be raise with both mr speaker and the house authority and that he receive response on point of order madam deputy speaker my mind be fill with the horrendous image of the assassination yesterday of charlie kirk an american conservative christian family man gun down he have attract the following of many million of young americans and have grow online presence in our country especially after he speak at the oxford union last month absolutely believe in free speech but we all understand that there be limit to free speech incitement constant personal vilification the use of horrendous historical image this be not left right issue it be not left right debate think it be incumbent upon all of we whichever side of the divide we be on however passionately we feel to behave with personal responsibility and mourn the loss of my friend thank the hon member for give notice of his point of order it serve as timely reminder of the need for respect in this place and in our politic while it be not matter for the chair he give the house an important opportunity to offer our condolence and to express our horror at the event in the usa yesterday biosecurity at the border britain illegal meat crisis environment food and rural affairs committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement on behalf of the environment food and rural affairs committee mr alistair carmichael will speak for up to minute during which time no intervention may be take at the conclusion of the statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not full speech and question should be direct to the select committee chair not to the relevant government minister front benchers however may take part in questioning thank the backbench business committee for allocate time for to make the statement which mark the publication of the third report by our committee in this parliament our report be title biosecurity at the border britain illegal meat crisis and it really be crisis it be crisis that have be brew for year if not decade it be also crisis that matter not just on the national level but on the individual and personal level we should never underestimate the impact that animal disease outbreak have on the mental health of farmer veterinary professional and other in our rural community when biosecurity break down in over million animal be slaughter across the united kingdom follow the outbreak of foot and mouth disease rural community be devastate the cost of the outbreak to our economy would be billion in today price expert at the time conclude that the infected meat that precipitate the outbreak have be import illegally in january this year foot and mouth disease be again report this time in germany expert there tell the committee that it be likely cause by illegally import food that single outbreak of foot and mouth disease cost the german economy billion and it require the culling of animal and the testing of thousand more in response the uk government announce import restriction but still at risk commercial consignment bypass border control post for six day despite the ban on affected product we will address that matter in our next report we have no idea how much unchecked produce be able to enter through personal import we do know that although border official be now make far few seizure of animal product than in the year follow the outbreak they be seize unprecedentedly high volume last year tonne of illegal animal product be seize at the uk border give the low level of check take place that must be just the tip of the iceberg port health worker tell we that they have see huge deterioration in the hygiene presentation of illegal meat and say that shipment be increase in size that meat be head to our high street our farm and our kitchen table frontline worker be anxious that disease outbreak be imminent and we should share their anxiety in her evidence to the committee the chief vet describe port health authority as our eye and ear at the border in that she be quite correct but still dover be the only port health authority in britain be fund to support the work of border force in seize illegal meat and dairy product even dover funding have be under threat this year funding be secure at the last minute and only after the intervention of stakeholder include our committee we visit dover and see the entirely unsuitable facility in which port health worker be be require to work we see van stuff with room temperature meat product package in plastic bag newspaper and cardboard box this meat have travel across europe unrefrigerated from country where african swine fever be widespread the minister responsible for biosecurity commit to visit the port of dover to see the situation for herself at the time of our report publication she still have not do so find that regrettable and very much hope it will be attend to in early course the relationship between defra and the dover port health authority be poor that serve no one interest and require immediate ministerial attention we know that when commercial import from certain country have be ban criminal have find new way to make money and be bring in product undeclared under the guise of personal import defra have reassure we that border force be deliver intelligence lead check we be concerned that this language hide the reality on the ground the reality be limited and incomplete intelligence network strained enforcement capability and port facility unsuitable for seize significant volume of potentially contaminate meat at the very least farmer and the public deserve great transparency about the risk we face we have call on the government to start publish quarterly datum relate to seizure of illegally import animal product we have also ask the government to model the amount of animal product enter britain and the risk this pose to our livestock meat smuggling be describe to our committee as the big threat to food security we have have for long time we do not know how these animal be rear and slaughter or how the meat have be handle or store it carry increase risk of virus bacteria and parasite that can make people sick and fall far below the strict standard that we require of british producer and legitimate importer and that consumer expect illegally import meat and dairy product be be sell online and via door to door sale to household and business illicit product can be find in market shop takeaway and hospitality venue where consumer trust that the food they be buy be safe and meet high welfare standard in some case meat be misrepresent as be of british origin we hear that the cost of living crisis be fuel the market for cheap illegally import meat as be demand for culturally prefer product like pork from eastern europe other meat and dairy product be illegally bring into great britain for personal consumption because individual be unaware of the prohibition or because they be willing to take the risk defra ban import of most animal product from the eu in april this year but many traveller do not know what the rule be or why they be in place we think travel operator should be legally compel to inform traveller of food prohibition rule for eu country as they be for other country there be currently no ownership in government of the issue of illegal import of animal product responsibility be so fragmented across agency that outdate inefficient way of work have be allow to persist and the scale of the crisis have escalate to an intolerable tolerable degree we have call on defra to establish taskforce to bridge the divide it should lead on the design and delivery of strategy for tackle meat smuggling we also find that border force be not adequately fulfil its responsibility to enforce rule at the border it have too many compete priority and officer lack understanding of the risk and rule associate with product of animal origin port health authority be willing to step up and support border force but be needlessly inhibit by lack of power and funding such authority should be give stop search and seize power in relation to animal product and funding for enforcement presence at the border there be currently no deterrent to meat smuggling so smuggler be operate with impunity defra must immediately deliver plan to start to fine and prosecute repeat offender and those who be attempt to smuggle significant amount of animal product successive government have be aware of the scale and risk of illegal meat import and have fail to deliver response proportionate to the challenge we have identify the risk and some of the solution it be essential that defra take those risk seriously and act to mitigate they with urgency the stake be too high for further inaction be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his comment and to member of the committee for look at this important issue be very proud of the farmer in newcastle under lyme whom meet as often as can be particularly proud of the high quality meat and milk that they produce in very difficult circumstance just yesterday meet howard to talk through some of his thought and challenge and one of the key thing that come through be the mental health impact on some of our farmer and those in our farming community note from the report and the evidence from the farming community network that there be call for real action can the chair of the committee say what think the committee will give to unpick some of the real challenge face farmer up and down the country even as thing currently stand we have mental health crisis in the farming industry we know from our own personal community experience from that that be moment of genuinely acute mental health crisis from which many people have not yet recover the truth of the matter be that one of the big challenge face the livestock sector be maintain critical mass of livestock number if we be to go through the same sort of cull that we go through in start from where we be today think we would risk lose that critical mass and that could have catastrophic impact on farmer right across the country should say to my right hon friend that think it be an excellent report be amazed to hear that tonne of illegal meat be detain at the border on august the government announce they will pause the plan introduction of physical check on live animal at the border with the eu to support business ahead of some sort of deal on sanitary and phytosanitary product what effect do he think that deal if it take place might have on illegal meat trade obviously the question of legal commercial import be slightly different in its operation from what we be bring to the house attention today but think we have to look at the whole thing in the round there be opportunity if we be able to get that sps deal and the committee will be look at that in the near future we will be visit brussels and speak to commission official about where the deal have get to we all know it be easy to agree that we need to agree but actually reach the agreement will always be the difficult part whatever we have by way of an sps agreement there will have to be rigorous check at the border but it may be that the sps agreement would make some of that an awful lot easy than it be at the moment and for everyone importer consumer and producer that have to be good as member of the committee attend the trip to dover where we see just how much meat could have be come in in the white van that be flood in border force be very busy and have numerous duty and the power and hour for the port health authority be far too limited it be obvious that it be not able to do as much as it would like those poor facility and that capacity for check be thing that we really think should be improve and increase yet sevington and bastion point be sit underuse or empty nearby do the chair of the committee think that they could and should be repurpose to help with this task first thank the hon lady and all other member of the committee for their engagement in this report and for the way in which they approach the work of the committee as whole may be slightly biased but really think they be quite excellent in the way they go about their business could not ask for well membership what we see at dover be truly shocking we be still close enough to lunch that be not go to give too many detail but the photograph that be provide to the committee be truly horrendous the hon lady suggest that the control point at sevington and bastion point could be repurpose which be an obvious solution the condition in which the port health authority worker operate be disgraceful work in big shed that we probably would not keep cattle in with hole in the roof and pigeon fly around meanwhile just few mile up the road there be purpose build facility where worker would at least be able to change into their personal protective equipment and have proper shower at the end of the day place on the record the committee gratitude to and my personal admiration of lucy manzano and her team at the dover port health authority who have do remarkable job and significant public service in bring this to the attention of the wide population on the committee visit to the port of dover we hear that many seizure of illegal meat include scale and till clear indication that the meat would be sell commercially most worryingly as the right hon gentleman say some of those import be head straight for farm so the potential for devastating outbreak of foot and mouth disease african swine fever or many other disease be huge do he agree that regardless of any potential sps agreement with the eu we certainly can not afford to scale back check if we be serious about protect british farming thank the hon gentleman for his contribution to the committee work which be hope the whip be here to hear this textbook example of how government back bencher should go about his business in committee he be absolutely right that see scale be worry it be obvious that that product be then go straight to the market and goodness know where after that our real concern be that we be bring in pork product from eastern europe and place where african swine fever be already present lot of that meat be we suspect destine for eastern european worker in our pig industry one do not have to be einstein to work out the scale and nature of the risk there we hear two thing one of the witness say that we be one carelessly discard ham sandwich away from disaster that be absolutely right the other thing that we be tell be that the possibility of an outbreak of african swine fever could be the death knell for the british pork industry as whole to my mind that really illustrate just how high the scale of risk be here congratulate and thank the committee for this valuable work biosecurity be national security the pork industry be worth billion year and the sector be vital to norfolk particularly south norfolk as other have say it be estimate that an outbreak of african swine fever would cost million do the right hon gentleman agree that in our effort to protect uk biosecurity we need also to focus on small port and airport as place of weakness the hon gentleman be absolutely right we risk end up play whole game of mole tighten the control at dover and see the effort displace to other community and port notwithstanding that the priority be still the short strait as the significant volume of import come through they that all underline the view of the committee that what be need be for somebody in government to take control of this issue with strategy for deal with it because there be no point in have the good national security at one port if all we do be displace the effort to other backbench business regional transport inequality call catherine atkinson who will speak for about minute beg to move that this house have consider regional transport inequality thank the backbench business committee for grant this debate it be originally due to take place on the first day back from the summer recess but there be not time because so many people want to speak be grateful to those in attendance today the importance of transport be completely understandable whether for travel to work and to healthcare appointment meet family and friend or get good to the business that need they transport keep our country run keep life move and keep we all connect this labour government be commit to open up opportunity across our country so it be important to address the historic and long stand inequality between region when it come to transport those of we who have the chance to go on holiday in the uk during our hot summer which already seem quite long time ago have return well acquaint with the transport infrastructure in each other constituency those who hear be we there yet on repeat from the back seat be perhaps too acquainted one of the benefit of be on the transport committee as well as have esteemed colleague number of whom be here today be that every trip can be an unofficial fact find trip we can compare sometimes enviously the new tram extension charge network or bus lane colleague across the country be advocate for transport project their constituency when we be successful in secure transport investment that change bring people together cut cost for our business and allow people to access new opportunity but when transport break down or get cut constituent suffer the consequence often daily one example in my constituency be the darley abbey mills bridge which be find to be unsafe and be shut leave people and business cut off and isolate temporary bridge be put in three year ago but thank to the new east midlands mayor claire ward funding have be secure to progress towards business case for build permanent bridge one of the reason that be so keen to be on the transport committee be that transport be essential to economic growth and decarbonisation the connectivity that transport bring be equally important up and down the country but the amount of investment that region get for transport have historically be mile apart transport be the most unequally distribute of area of spending include education and health there be many colleague here from the east midland which have the low transport expenditure per head of all the region and nation in the united kingdom in it be per person just quarter of the amount for london and about half the average for england if the east midland have be allocate the uk average in the five year between and we would have receive an additional billion to ensure prosperity reach all corner of our country more equal investment be vital so welcome the direction of travel in the spending review include the billion of investment in local transport project for england city region over the next five year more than double the previous capital spending rate that include billion of funding secure by our excellent east midlands mayor claire ward for year there have be concern that the uk green book the treasury official guidance for appraise public investment be skew how area of need be identify there have be an over concentration of investment in high gdp area neglect the potential of other region which create vicious cycle welcome the chancellor review and look forward to the new green book next year to secure the transformational change that we need this labour government be invest in area that have be neglect and forget speak of neglect when it come to pothole and the need to well maintain and improve our road this government have increase capital funding to billion over three year that be particularly important for derbyshire which accord to the rac have the bad pothole in the country with the well bus bill the government have recognise the importance of bus travel my hon friend be make an excellent introductory speech on regional inequality in transport bus be incredibly important in my constituency and they need not only investment but support newcastle be yet to receive real time bus information of the type that have be enjoy in london for more than decade which make transport more reliable and therefore more used do she agree that we need to ensure that the technology that support these important service be also more equally distribute across the country think we can all agree that the well the technology and the real time information that be need the more people will be encourage to use our bus we absolutely need to encourage more people to use our bus over the year up to we see massive loss of bus service where the cut hit have vary but hard hit be the east midland region where we lose of our bus service the transport committee highlight that decline in our report on bus that be publish over the summer we must not forget on whom bus investment impact the most the young the elderly those on low income and the disabled hon member will be shock that have get this far into my speech without mention train because talk about rail quite lot which be entirely understandable as derby mp derby will be the home of great british railways it be the city at the centre of the large cluster of rail company in europe and arguably globally it be the city that few week ago host the greatest gathering the world large ever gathering of historical and modern rail vehicle which be describe as glastonbury for celebrate the anniversary of the modern railway however despite this rich rail heritage in the region there be just over rail station for million people the region have the low proportion of people live within to minute walk of rail station in england and about three quarter of those station be serve by just one train or few per hour the capital of rail will be the region with the low train station usage per head in england our midland main line that run through the east midland be the only main line route in england that be not yet fully electrify it be electrify to wigston south of leicester east midlands railway will be put on new bi mode train by the end of the year so those live alongside the route up to wigston will benefit and the million passenger who use the line will get that far use electrified track after wigston however the train will revert to diesel and the rest of the densely populate line will continue to be expose to more noise and ten of thousand of tonne of every year hundred of people have write to support the call for electrification my hon friend mention that constituent have write to she but do she acknowledge that in addition more than mp have be work together to advocate for electrification because of the great benefit she have describe be grateful for the support that my hon friend alongside many colleague have show for electrification and the benefit that it can bring it would be fitting celebration of year of the modern railway to continue the electrification of the midland main line which would bring job skill and hundred of million of pound in economic benefit particularly to the east midland love my region and like so many in this chamber know my region strength and can imagine the possibility if investment be genuinely equitably distribute around our country if our regional transport be more equal it would create more prosperity economic growth social equality regional development and carbon reduction as well as well air quality our transport infrastructure be the country circulatory system it connect and enrich wherever it reach if someone circulation be not great they feel the cold little more in their finger as well know if it be restrict more their arm and leg get fatigue numbness and pain in the extreme it eventually lead to organ failure that be where we have be head for far too long but over the last year the government have be get the blood pump again will the hon lady give way be just about to finish if the uk be body derby be geographically at its heart and be ask to have the same chance as everywhere else to be connect we need to maintain our change of direction to reduce the inequality in the spend per person on transport stay on track towards the reduction and ultimately the elimination of regional transport inequality and deliver fair funding for transport rise order there be an immediate four minute time limit in just one year this labour government have already fail rural britain on transport they have scrap the bus fare cap push up cost for work people they have waste million in the process of nationalise south western railway while my commuter be still stick with cancel peak service and they continue to pour billion of pound into london while community such as farnham bordon haslemere and liphook in my constituency be leave behind my constituency be just mile from london yet the difference in connectivity be stark london enjoy world class system well when it be not be hold to ransom by greedy tube driver union as be the case this week but farnham haslemere bordon and liphook be treat very differently the contrast with london be outrageous in the capital there be bus stop every metre and service run every five to minute throughout the night in my constituency bus be to minute apart if they run at all and many disappear entirely after pm student at the university for the creative arts in farnham can not get to guildford in the evening meanwhile londoner can choose from over night bus route whereas passenger in london pay fix fare people in rural surrey and hampshire pay much more because labour hike the cap my constituent will remember that labour put up their fare which be why take action convene the bordon taskforce to bring stagecoach local council and local leader around the table and the result speak for themselves the newly revise no bus service now run every minute on weekday and saturdays and hourly on sundays link bordon whitehill farnham and aldershot the no service between bordon alton and basingstoke have also be strengthen with six sunday return journey stagecoach even trialle free travel this june after my push for well value these be tangible improvement that make life easy for thousand of people but gap still remain it be extraordinary that there be no bus connection between bordon and petersfield only mile apart except for single school service that be why be in talk with east hampshire district council to establish new route model on the waverley hospital scheme for which secure funding in farnham agree with the point that my hon friend be make the train to my constituency run through his constituency and he have refer to it already unfortunately my constituency be reliant on entirely privatised ferry company in order for we to get there do he agree that if this government outlook on transport be to be truly integrate they need to connect all part of the united kingdom and stop focus only on city my hon friend make powerful and important point he be absolutely right this government be focus on metropolitan area and constituency like his and mine which be rural and rural be simply leave behind his mention of rail neatly bring to my point on rail rail tell the same story as bus three of my four major town have train station but bordon the third large one have none and the line that do exist be fragmented and unreliable only this week the from farnham to waterloo be cancel too often peak time train arrive at haslemere or liphook with just four coach when challenge south western railway on that be tell that to avoid cancellation near london it reassign carriage away from my area make it clear my commuter be not second class citizen and that need to change at south western farnham depot this summer press the company directly on the million arterio fleet which be mean to relieve overcrowding but be still sit idle for want of driver or because of fault secure assurance of change and will now hold the company to account meanwhile as mention the government waste million nationalise south western railway that money could have deliver permanent bordon to liphook bus link for year instead urban area get crossrail and tram while my constituent get cancellation and four carriage train that be clearly not acceptable much more help be need for my constituent rural community such as mine can not keep be treat as second class level up economic growth and net zero all laudable aim mean nothing if million of people in my constituency and the surround area can not get bus on sunday or train with more than four carriage on monday morning that be the reality of labour transport policy high fare waste money and broken promise that be unacceptable to my constituent and hope unacceptable to the constituent of every single member of this house thank my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson for secure this crucial debate high quality reliable and integrated public transport be often the difference between community get ahead or be leave behind whether that be young people be able to realise their aspiration old people receive the healthcare they need or work people get home safely after night shift those issue not only have practical consequence if leave unaddresse but erode trust between our constituent and the government they elect lack of transport connectivity impede the progress that people need and deserve to see in their community if we do not fix that we make it easy for those who turn to pessimistic narrative to talk our country down our constituent deserve so much more the disparity in transport investment between north and south be the result of model that be build from the top down and the centre out model that have at its heart an orthodoxy that be ill suited to the need of passenger today and model be proud to say this government in partnership with our regional mayor be begin to dismantle from much need review of the green book to increase capital spending in greater manchester and other city region from the introduction of integrate settlement for combined authority and modern industrial strategy to the transformative english devolution bill those be all reason be proud to be greater manchester labour parliamentarian we have pioneering transport network where power devolve nationally be see and feel on the ground my hon friend talk about be greater manchester mp and newcastle under lyme and our part of staffordshire be not too far away wonder whether she would support my call for direct train line from stoke on trent station to manchester airport which would unlock growth and cut cost for family in particular those seek to travel more importantly it would put our part of the world on the map be sure that be something the transport minister have listen to and be look at greater manchester have set the agenda when it come to the promise and opportunity that devolution can galvanise through the development and expansion of the bee network an integrated transport system through low fare and simplify ticketing and an enhanced bus and metrolink network with plan to integrate heavy rail line in the future the bee network utility go far beyond get people from to it be conduit for employment opportunity house building and thriving regional economy indeed greater manchester productivity growth measure by gross value add in the past decade have outstrip that of every other region include london transport have be central to make that happen despite real success however we can not take future progress for grant greater manchester and other city region remain just as deserve of our backing today to ensure that we do not scupper economic growth in the region we must ensure that the significant project be move forward swiftly and efficiently to give people hope for more connected future and that include the trans pennine route upgrade and the manchester to liverpool rail enhancement get that right be integral to transform public transport and create network predicate finally on the need of local people rather than on the paternalism of the centre my constituent can speak with some experience on this for decade passenger live in heywood and middleton have be mere afterthought with no rail connectivity into manchester city centre despite be just few mile away bus service that do not align with the life and aspiration of local people and an incredibly congest road network in the one year that have be the proud member of parliament for heywood and middleton north with central government work in lockstep with our combine authority we have secure funding to ensure that the tram will now connect heywood to manchester city centre that be thank to the billion of funding allocate to greater manchester by our labour chancellor in the form of transport for city region funding enable the mayor and his team to plan for the long term it also mean that local leader in concert with the combine authority be work to deliver mayoral development corporation in middleton with the strong possibility of new metrolink service there too this be the difference that devolution can make and in greater manchester we have show what we be capable of but we can not be complacent expertise in town and transport planning must be far develop in our region and our bank of knowledge must deepen funding cycle should become yet more assured across the country enable our local and regional leader to have the confidence to innovate fundamentally we must formalise and codify engagement between the department and mayoralty and not just ahead of fiscal event but consistently so that we can build robust transport network that support the need of local people regional transport inequality do not have to spell out foregone conclusion we just need to find the political conviction to confront they each town city and village have within it people who be capable of reach the sum of their ambition we just need to be unrelenting in build the transport system to get they there would like to highlight the deep inequality in transport spending across our country and to speak specifically about the railway in the south west per head of population our region receive significantly less investment in transport than the average in fact the south west region receive the second low funding in the country after the east midland as we hear from the hon member for derby north catherine atkinson only we do not have the prospect of electrification to look forward to on our main line probably ever accord to the house of commons library transport spending in be per person in the south west compare with per person in london in the north west and in the west midland that be not level up it be level down this matter on daily basis for my constituent in newton abbot and for community across devon and the south west our transport link be essential to our economy tourism trade and everyday life but all too often they be neglect we all remember when storm tear through our sea wall at dawlish in cut the south west off from the rest of the country the cliff block the line for eight week cost the south west economy some billion the dawlish rail resilience programme be split into five phase with the last be the most critical that vital phase have not be fund the government have reject all solution put forward by network rail so far and now we do not even have the funding to develop an acceptable alternative every winter storm put our connection with the rest of the uk at risk and the government be not take this seriously urge the government to give network rail the parameter they will accept and clear funding to design solution lack of solution could cost another billion if or when the cliff fail again accessibility be another area where we be fall short too many railway station in the south west still lack step free access would particularly like to see well access at teignmouth station disabled passenger be force to choose their journey base not on where they want to go but on which station they be able to use that be not acceptable in this day and age my hon friend rightly draw attention to teignmouth station despite its large size my constituency do not have single mainline train station but our close station bodmin parkway also have severe accessibility challenge it have be put on the list for accessibility upgrade but that could happen as late as will he join in call on the minister to make those upgrade as quickly as possible so that our constituent do not miss out absolutely agree with my hon friend when we have the railway station defence rebuild at dawlish we do get the benefit of lift teignmouth still do not have that before the lift be put in disabled passenger be put on what be call barrow crossing they be literally put on trolley and wheel across the railway line that be just not acceptable say this clearly the south west deserve its fair share we need fair transport spending proper disabled access at every station and full commitment to complete the resilience work that will protect our region lifeline rail route will keep press the house and this government until the south west get the fair share it deserve be incredibly grateful to my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson for bring forward this important debate she speak with passion about the subject the south east can be describe as leafy and rich with kent be the garden of england but part of that garden have be leave unnurture untended and leave behind transport inequality can be frame as north south divide in my constituency there be north south divide where people live in the north of the constituency have low life expectancy of over decade but both the urban and rural community have be leave behind when speak with young people during the campaign and more recently they tell that transport be their no issue it be about connectivity and get across gravesham because there be no bus on sunday that can take they to town to meet their friend and there be no bus that can take they after school if they want to stay and do extracurricular activity mum recently contact about her year old who be excited to start at northfleet technology college which specialise in engineering they choose that college because of the bus route the but that have now be scrap we see this up and down our country bus route be there one day and scrap the next the new bus route mean nearly an hour journey with minute walk on top of that pass cost for that privilege the kent freedom pass which be run by kent county council previously tory but now reform lead use to cost now it be over year and rise family be be price out and although help to secure option to pay in monthly instalment the cost remain out of reach for many in urban area of my constituency reliability be major concern the cliff collapse at galley hill in the neighbouring constituency be have major impact on the reliability of bus under the tories ebbsfleet development corporation million of pound have go to shiny fast track route however they serve the new development while existing community have lose their service altogether the people of northfleet lose their bus route they be promise physical connection between northfleet station and ebbsfleet international place that have some of the high level of deprivation but that have be place on hold indefinitely mean that new housing development see that investment while those who really could do with that opportunity have be leave behind that be two tier public transport system and it be not fair in gravesham we see bus company compete in relatively small area for similar route undercut each other and make timetable choice base on profit not where people actually want to go be incredibly confident that the new bus service bill will enable local people to make the route well for themselves must mention the ferry bring back the tilbury gravesend ferry because it be not only about get across the borough but get to essex support our business as place for growth the hon member mention ferry perhaps she will show little sympathy to and my constituent because we be entirely reliant on ferry that be unregulated and privatised so neither the local authority nor the government have any say over those service whereas her local authority do have say over her ferry she might want to reflect on the role of government in all mode of transport across the uk the hon member and share passion for ferry my ferry no long run so despite have local government agency that could intervene and supply ferry it let go of that contract will continue to bang that drum because ferry be an incredibly important mode of transport for so many people especially his constituent on the isle of wight the government want to see transport as gateway to opportunity which fully support not the barrier that it be today and have be for many year we must unleash community power and agency to bring voice to the people of gravesham especially the young people who deserve the right to opportunity via bus and boat thank the hon member for derby north catherine atkinson for introduce this really important debate in my maiden speech over year ago in railway debate speak about the state of the railway in my constituency and the need to open station devizes gateway to bring back service to the town lose since the day of beeching despite effort in the name of level up any progress make to tackle regional inequality in transport have be modest and inconsistent represent many small town and village that rarely benefit from national policy initiative and all too often have to rely on private car to travel long distance to service school and job more equal distribution of transport fund could drastically improve the life of people in my constituency and thousand of other up and down the country one academic study find that fifth of worker have turn down job because of poor bus service another find that of those look for job say that the lack of personal transport or inadequate public transport be key barrier to their get job wiltshire be in challenging position when it come to rail travel we have railway but many do not benefit from the service which all too often carry people and freight across the county but do not stop at the few station in the county local service range from unreliable to non existent nowhere be that mismatch feel more strongly than in devizes town at the geographical and cultural heart of wiltshire with its historic centre independent business and nearby world heritage site the town marketplace stand just two and half mile from major railway line but in order to access the network passenger must travel by road mile to chippenham or mile to swindon melksham fast grow industrial town fare little well with only one train every two hour during most of the day local can not rely on it for work and school and many be not even aware of it major improvement to wiltshire rail service can be make with only minor infrastructure upgrade network rail wiltshire rail strategy set out the compelling case for build the devizes gateway station reconnecte people live in and around the town to the railway and bring more visitor to that special part of wiltshire be also delighted to be support the bath and wiltshire metro proposal which would deliver many of the improvement we need locally include for melksham group of industry expert be meet in bath as speak to discuss how we can leverage exist infrastructure to regenerate our community where good transport lead high quality housing job and economic opportunity will follow the secretary of state offer kind and encourage word in transport question this morning however follow the meeting in bath today it would be enormously useful if the rail minister would agree to meeting with and the participant for rural area such as south norfolk transport link be lifeline so be delighted that this government be do what previous government fail to do invest in south norfolk infrastructure already have secure million investment to upgrade the thickthorn junction shave valuable lifesave minute off journey for ambulance to access the norfolk and norwich hospital which will also benefit the constituency of the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew directly have also secure million for key cycle and footpath access across norfolk include the hethersett to norwich research park cycle route but there be more to do today want to touch on three point first rural road safety secondly bus service in south norfolk and thirdly the minister will not be surprised to hear mention this again wymondham train station on my first point be currently run constituency wide survey on rural road safety in south norfolk once the survey have conclude will share my finding with norfolk county council the police and crime commissioner for norfolk and the roads minister what be already clear however be that norfolk road be simply not fit for purpose they be unsafe and cover with pothole despite our labour government increase norfolk county council budget for pothole repair to million on bus service the situation be just as frustrating for disabled and less mobile resident of estate like the hampdens in costessey bus service be in effect non existent the whole of the hampdens estate be without bus service they deserve well than this enforce isolation now turn to wymondham train station as the department already know from my many many lobbying attempt platform southbound from wymondham have no step free access it be victorian train station that be celebrate its birthday so anyone with mobility issue want to travel south from wymondham must first travel all the way north to norwich then turn around and travel all the way back down that be completely inefficient isolate and unjust once again the primary victim of poor transport provision be elderly and disabled people accessibility upgrade to wymondham station be be consider by the access for all scheme realise that the minister will not be able to comment in any detail about wymondham station but can think of no well way to prove the government dedication to tackle regional transport inequality than to make it accessible for all viewer of the bbc politics east would expect all politician from east anglia to want to talk about another aspect of rail use the ely and haughley junction upgrade will continue to lobby on this cross party issue across the whole of east anglia the upgrade would shave off valuable minute and increase freight haulage to felixstowe which would be huge economic boost for our region and would get more service to wymondham and spooner row which would be win for everyone again put that on the minister to do list to sum up we need to hold norfolk county council to account for fail to fix our road we need to continue make progress to improve access to bus service and wymondham station must finally be make accessible to all as the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on heritage rail must start by note that we be celebrate railway on september the railway bring wealth new idea and vitality to community across the uk they be and be the vehicle of growth our many heritage railway include in my constituency continue to marry technology old and new and to bring so much happiness to so many people but the great little train of wales be now charitable or private railway wales public rail network have be the last stop on the line for investment legacy that continue to impact the life of people and community across our nation the network rail wales route which account for of the uk rail network receive wait for of the enhancement budget between and the welsh government previously estimate that wales could be miss out on up to billion in rail investment between and hon member will note that that span number of government here in westminster the funding deficit lead to inadequate public transport infrastructure which have far reach consequence particularly for those who have no access to car and those who live in post industrial and rural area it limit people ability to connect with friend and family and create barrier to access education and employment opportunity in wales we want to improve our productivity and we want the mean to do it the spring statement in june offer only token gesture towards address the deep root funding disparity that wales face for example the government suggestion that the million of rail investment over year will compensate for the historical underfunding of the welsh network or the multibillion pound injustice of wales exclusion from funding be simply not credible where be the reinforcement against climate change where be the electrification of our line let we not forget that the current secretary of state for wales acknowledge in opposition that wales fair share from should be at least billion so we have receive tenth of what our own welsh secretary of state once feel be fair the spring statement also include the government review of the green book aim at improve investment outside london and the south east of england yet on examine its content be disappoint but not surprised to find no commitment to reform the way in which welsh rail be fund this inequality remain unaddressed the government decision to classify the oxford to cambridge railway as project that benefit wales be stark example of the kind of accounting manipulation massage that deprive wales of rightful barnett consequential funding just as we see with under the conservatives indeed early this year the secretary of state for wales acknowledge in write that welsh rail have suffer significant under investment yet there have be no pledge to bring spending in wales in line with per capita investment level in england urge the government to move beyond rhetoric and take decisive action let we begin by devolve power over heavy rail to wales end the ability for the outdated barnett funding formula to be manipulate to wales detriment while also grant wales meaningful control over rail transport investment just as scotland and northern ireland already have be grateful to have the opportunity to speak in really important debate on regional transport inequality for too long community in the north east have suffer the effect of chronic underinvestment in transport and the flawed legacy of privatisation what should be public service have instead become patchwork system that too often fail local people on the railway the propose lner timetable risk cut vital stop at durham for many that would mean unnecessary change at york or newcastle for old people disabled passenger and those travel with child that create real barrier and make our railway less accessible at time when they should be open up bus tell similar story in brandon ushaw moor waterhouses and newton hall people depend on service from arriva and go north east yet complaint reach my inbox every week the from langley park to sunderland and the from esh win to durham be both unreliable and in some village bus simply do not run at all on sundays or bank holiday too often our area be leave with the old bus prone to break down while the new vehicle serve the route in newcastle and sunderland although funding for new bus stop be welcome my constituent ask what good they be when the service to go with they be not reliable there be workforce challenge too shortage of engineer cause delay when our further education college could be support to provide apprenticeship and skill locate depot in consett where bad weather frequently disrupt operation have only add to problem another issue be that our driver in the region be pay less than colleague in the north west by the exact same company hardly recipe for recruitment or retention all that reflect the wide picture of year of underinvestment and inequality have the north receive the same per person transport spending as london since we would have have billion more enough to transform the system instead nearly fifth of rural bus route have vanish in just five year deepen isolation for many do my hon friend agree that there be nothing more isolating than not be able to get somewhere my constituent elishia ingham try to get her mobility scooter on to bus service but be reject entry on to the bus because there be not enough space do my hon friend agree that even though bus company do not have to allow that by law they might increasingly consider the need of disabled traveller could not agree more although we may improve our bus service and the type of modern bus we have they be not accessible in all area and that be huge inequality the government bus services no bill be chance to put this right with franchising fair pay and investment in modern vehicle we can build system that work for passenger support job and meet our climate goal reliable and affordable public transport should not be luxury it be the foundation of fair economy and connected community my constituent in the city of durham deserve no less they deserve transport service that serve local people not profit and ministers must act to deliver it be listen to radio yesterday evening and be hear about transport problem in london let face it when we hear about transport problem in london we know exactly what they mean but pity also the poor people in the province who rarely come to london but have to hear all about london daily problem in devon the struggle with our rail infrastructure be not just an occasional disruption it be an everyday reality every year there be around million rail journey to from or within the south west of england yet accord to the office of rail and road between january and march this year only of south western railway service run on time mean that one in three train arrive late those figure be collect even before the disruption on south western railway over the summer when speed be reduce because of the hot dry weather cause by the soil moisture deficit journey from honiton to london which should take little over three hour be drag out to nearly four service from axminster whimple and feniton to exeter be reduce to just one every two hour that be not service that people can rely on for work for get to college or for family life and with hotter summer set to become more frequent we need lasting solution even in normal time the line be fragile it depend on long single track section which mean that if one train be late other train be delay too train back up at pass point delay ripple down the line and at busy time south western railway have to cut or it have be cut at least carriage number in half leave people cram in one solution would involve increase rail capacity along the line between axminster and exeter at its heart there would be new mile section of dual track near whimple and cranbrook that single improvement would make huge difference with the double track in place south western railway could run an additional hourly shuttle service between axminster and exeter which would give honiton and axminster two train every hour to exeter and would mean that whimple and feniton would get reliable hourly service people would have well onward connection from exeter st davids to plymouth barnstaple bristol birmingham and beyond my hon friend make really interesting point about dualling of line have be campaign in my constituency of harrogate and knaresborough to dual the line between knaresborough and york for the exact same reason and benefit that my hon friend be describe do he agree that if this government want to get on with the job of growth go far and fast on invest in dualle line like ours would be way to do it my hon friend be absolutely right he point to how it be much more affordable simply to dual piece of track than it be to invest in new railway line as we talk about lot in the last parliament for student study at exeter college for worker head into exeter and for business trade across the south west such solution would be transformative it would make the railway more resilient when there be delay whether they be because of flooding autumn leaf or dry clay embankment train could pass more easily with the government plan around new home along the line between axminster and exeter demand on this stretch of railway will only increase finally we can not ignore the roll stock the train themselves the diesel fleet be nearly year old reliability be fail and spare part be run out we need government decision on new train battery electric or hybrid so that by the early we might have modern clean reliable fleet rural and coastal community such as honiton and sidmouth must not be leave behind south western railway be do what it can since ask the rail minister question this morning at transport question south western railway have announce replacement bus from axminster to exeter and between feniton whimple and exeter but that be stick plaster what we really need be investment that would allow it to run reliable train not just replacement bus service people in the south west pay many of the same taxis as those in london but face long delay overcrowding and few train it be time for the government to demonstrate that attention to transport in the south west be just as necessary as that in london order with an immediate three minute limit call andrew cooper thank you madam deputy speaker will do my good to indulge you on the fly thank my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson for secure this debate transport be not just about go from one place to another it be about enable progress it open door to education employment and enterprise while also keep we connect to the people and community that matter most but for many community particularly across the north transport have not be catalyst for opportunity but source of disadvantage deep root inequality in regional infrastructure have leave countless town and city disconnected limit access to job education and essential service the consequence of this divide be tangible affect life livelihood and the ability of entire region to thrive that be because transport investment in the uk have be starkly unequal for decade while london and the south east have benefit from sustained strategic funding many town and city across the north have be leave behind with age infrastructure underfunded network and crucially miss opportunity for growth the number speak for themselves historically per capita transport spending in london have dwarf that of the north indeed analysis show that have the north receive the same level of transport infrastructure investment per person as london between and it would have gain an additional billion fund it have ultimately miss out on due to regional disparity in infrastructure investment in my local area inadequate transport infrastructure remain one of the most significant barrier to unlock the full potential of northwich winsford and middlewich it be major obstacle to attract new business create job and drive investment but hope that change be come thank to this labour government the recent reform to the treasury green book represent turning point the update green book place great emphasis on regional equity and on the long term social and economic benefit of investment it recognise that value be not just measure in pound and penny but measure in life improve community connect and future transform it be chance to rebalance our economy invest in the infrastructure that power productivity and ensure that no matter where someone live whether it be middlewich or manchester winsford or warrington they have access to the same opportunity as someone live in london or the south east the government have begin this policy with action with real visible investment in northern transport from rail upgrade and new bus route to road building scheme such as the middlewich eastern bypass in my constituency be proud to say it be this labour government who deliver the investment for this vital project although suspect the former minister approve it just to stop camp outside her office and badger she in the tea room be grateful for her support but her successor should know that this now mean my lobby power be free to be direct to other noble cause such as improvement to the winnington bridge and step free access at northwich station thank my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson for bring this really important debate to the house growth go where growth be but when transport be inefficient access to opportunity be limited leigh and atherton once thrive industrial hub now sit between manchester and liverpool alongside town such as st helens warrington wigan and salford yet we remain locked in outdated transport system road build around our mill and factory be now clog with ever increase traffic this be not just local issue the gridlock we face be share burden and shared injustice leigh rank in the top nationally for transport relate social exclusion in my constituency over of resident face high risk of exclusion due to poor transport that be twice the north west average and nearly five time that of greater manchester poor connectivity and an reliance on car be isolate our most vulnerable old people disabled resident and low income family people be be trap in cycle of poverty and miss opportunity have speak to resident who set off three hour early to make hospital appointment other turn down college place or job offer simply because they can not afford car and opportunity be out of reach without one that should not be the case and it do not have to be we must invest in accessible sustainable transport walking cycling bus and train across every region not just where the growth be greater manchester be shin example of the first stage of the transformative impact that transport devolution can deliver over million be be invest in safe clean transport through the bee network service such as the and bus in leigh and atherton be vital and the plan new railway station in golborne be huge step forward but we must go far without reliable and inclusive transport access to job education and healthcare remain postcode lottery welcome the discussion to expand metrolink to area such as salford crescent wigan and leigh those investment must continue there be also the proposal to connect our two great region spearhead by greater manchester mayor andy burnham and liverpool city region mayor steve rotheram with the greater manchester economy grow fast than the uk as whole after their recent comment say to the leadership of reform who be not in their seat that we have prove what ambition back with investment can achieve for our region it be transport infrastructure that be drive that success we on this side of the house will not let short sighted politic stall the north momentum thank my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson for secure this vital debate in derby like many other part of the country transport be the glue that hold our community together but derby be also city of maker we have unique transport manufacturing heritage to be proud of and future to be excited about if we be talk about investment in our public transport however it be totally different story while derby power our supply chain the east midland have be leave lag behind when it come to fund our transport infrastructure under successive government our region have sit consistently at the back of the queue for investment in that mean that transport spending in the east midland be just of the uk average shockingly the low of any uk region or nation as we hear early that be not just number it be delay lose opportunity and frustration for people just try to go about their day to day ask anyone in our community and they will say that they have be stick on the same congested road for year and they have watch vital bus service disappear as our region have face the consequence of the deep bus cut in the country since understandably people be absolutely feed up that be why be proud that this labour government along with our fantastic east midlands mayor claire ward be waste no time turn the page with record billion secure early this year to tackle congestion and improve connectivity across the east midland we be finally start to put thing right that be not all whether it be move forward on upgrade to the to end derby traffic gridlock or the introduction of the bus services no bill protect thousand of mile of lifeline route across our region progress be be make there be still lot more to do to put decade of under investment behind we secure project such as the electrification of the midland main line would supercharge our region create job reduce journey time and improve reliability as well as unlock over million worth of economic benefit for the region to transform our transport infrastructure we need sustained long term funding in our region that at the very minimum match the uk average look forward to see that deliver through action and investment from government who back derby and the east midland would like to talk about the importance of the impact of both austerity and covid on entrench the regional transport inequality we have hear so much about today will also talk about the importance of our make the most of our exist infrastructure which have end up crumble and neglect after the previous year and emphasise the importance of improve service and restore those batter by austerity and covid this issue be particularly important in coastal community be proud to sit next to my co chair of the all party parliamentary group on coastal community my hon friend the member for scarborough and whitby alison hume despite the geographical difference between our two constituency we share concern about the connectivity challenge in our coastal community and we know that many other place be experience the same problem because as much as coastal community have many asset they be fundamentally at the end of the line they be therefore say this advisedly to those currently in the chamber most expose and vulnerable to the populism and dark force we have see around we recently when we think about all that we understand the need to connect people to opportunity for growth and to break down the barrier to opportunity two of our key mission as country on that great strategic point urge anyone from stagecoach and kent county council who be listen to restore the no bus between ramsgate and canterbury for precisely that reason one of our hospital be there as be two of our university and the further education college know child young people and adult whose opportunity have be limit and cut back because that no bus service no long exist let talk about the impact of covid particularly in respect of the crumble and neglect infrastructure we have as consequence ashford international train station have be international in name only since the covid pandemic and eurostar expansion plan do not include the restoration of international rail service to kent cut the length of train journey from kent to paris and brussels by two hour would greatly improve the opportunity for we as community and indeed for growth the good growth foundation have point out that this would improve growth by billion across five year unlike other so call affluent part of the east place like mine really need that economic growth on exist infrastructure have one last message for the minister about ramsgate port it be important to restore passenger ferry at least to place that be desperately in need of that kind of connectivity be pleased to follow my hon friend the member for east thanet ms billington who talk about the impact of covid on transport many of my constituent across lichfield burntwood and the village rely on the cross city line to get to birmingham for work for social activity to visit the theatre or go for night out and for many other reason unfortunately during the pandemic the service on the line be cut from four train an hour to just two that be understandable at the time give the circumstance but year have pass and those train be still not back the cross city line be the busy commuter train line in the country outside of london in the year before covid million journey start at lichfield city go towards birmingham new street lichfield be city of people and million journey begin at that train station it be busy line it be important infrastructure this debate be about regional transport inequality the idea that on line that busy that serve anywhere in the south east or london the service would be halve and nothing do about it for year be absolutely laughable but because it be in the west midland the service have not come back the villain in this piece be just how busy new street be it be over capacity we can not get any more train in or out that be why be so glad to have campaign to get the midland rail hub project fund and to have co ordinate dozen of back bench mps to support the campaign that will improve the capacity at new street mean that we can get our train back on the city line it also mean that station across number of region will get to see improvement in their service that be fantastic example of this government invest in the project that we need to close some of the transport inequality gap and thank the minister for that as have minute left and give that those improvement be come let say this have line from lichfield to burton that pass by the national memorial arboretum in staffordshire it would make brilliant place for passenger service so that everybody from around the country can get to the national memorial arboretum to enjoy the fantastic facility that it be and take part in remembrance all year round not just in november strongly believe that regional geography be the right scale to make substantial public transport improvement that be why back this government devolution agenda as the right approach to improve transport the real inequality of the future will not be north versus south or urban versus rural but between those area that have well respect ambitious mayor and those that do not for the sake of passenger hope that the government move swiftly to fill in the gap on the devo map even if there be not complete consensus inequality in transport be already link to some extent to governance in the past large area have passenger transport executive and that give they head start as more power head to strategic authority still believe that the government could go far to encourage the creation of more executive body to co ordinate transport regionally also remain concerned about the highway transport split very much welcome clause of the english devolution and community empowerment bill which will allow mayoral combined authority to take on civil enforcement of traffic contravention but we could go far fundamentally the same organisation need to be responsible for the bus the bus lane and the bus stop we also need to think differently about geography from the victorian radial rail network through to modern motorway there have for too long be an assumption that all road and rail should lead to london but we can not just think north to south it must be east to west too that be why warmly welcome the billion commitment to east west rail to rebalance decade of under investment in cross country link will continue to call for the expansion of the luton dunstable busway to leighton buzzard and on to bletchley link it into east west rail the minister will be delighted to know that my final question be train question rather than bus question be keen to hear from he about plan for great british railways within region do he believe that the current network rail region be the right one to build on as we move to gbr or do he believe there be other opportunity and shape other than triangle we must always see transport as driver of growth in order to build thriving network we need relentless focus on grow passenger number which we can all do as we know that september be catch the bus month we know that when it come to transport inequality as we have just hear the people who be leave behind most be young people disabled people people on low income and old people madam deputy speaker note that when you be the chair of the women and equalities committee you call for an old people commissioner in this respect that could provide real value in the time available to will major in as many transport form as possible yesterday speak about bus in bournemouth we be cry out for well no bus the reinstatement of the bus route in and to throop and bus to the airport that be well and go more frequently we need strong provision of electric vehicle charge infrastructure it be typically concentrate in more affluent area and where it be concentrate in public area it do not work when it come to train be campaign for an accessible pokesdown station and fast train to london want to talk particularly about the problem that people experience locally with access drive test the labour government have commit to additional driving test and we have four additional instructor in poole but people in bournemouth east have to travel to poole to take their test because their centre be close in operator be use bot to sweep up month worth of test date and sell they to parent and learner at high profit that be not fair and it be an example of inequality have write to the driving and vehicle standards agency but it be nowhere to be see on this issue want this government to be on the side of learner and to tackle the drive test backlog welcome the fact that we have million in funding come to bournemouth christchurch and poole council for the improvement of transport infrastructure and that we have an extra million to invest on pothole particularly want to make the case for the first time in this chamber for the resurrection of tram network in bournemouth which think be really important interruption can hear murmur of assent from my hon friend everyone love tram trams foster economic social and cultural growth around they in bournemouth which have join two other town to create super city region we be fall behind in economic growth opportunity because we do not have the interconnectedness we need be go to say more but will just briefly say that if we can have fast train to london accessible station the pothole in our road fill well bus service more drive test and tram network which because of its permanence attract business organisation and people to move into our area those area be already thrive but could thrive so much more bournemouth would no long be leave behind bournemouth would thrive it be fantastic beautiful town which be so proud to represent and with the elimination of our transport inequality there would be no limit to the success we could achieve the perception many people have of kent be one of prosperity because of our close proximity to london but the reality be more complicated in my constituency we have widespread inequality and community feel overlooked and disconnected as be all too evident in the way our transport network operate nowhere have that be more evident than in the decision take by eurostar in to stop the international rail service call at ashford international my hon friend the member for east thanet ms billington highlight the importance of international connectivity to the south east for its economic benefit the decision have leave the international section of the station which cost about million of taxpayer money sit idle for over five year so far this autumn the office of rail and road be due to make decision about whether new provider of international rail will have access to the international depot at temple mills in east london as the orr come to its decision ask the minister whether the government will give clear indication that they will favour operator who commit to return such service to ashford the london focus of our transport network mean that while there be good service between ashford and london there be not the same provision of service for my constituent look to travel across kent or make local journey that do not involve the capital this disproportionately affect those who do not have access to car such as young people elderly resident the disabled and low income household it limit their access to work opportunity healthcare appointment and local amenity in particular have be contact by many constituent since be elect who have complain about the poor condition of local bus service that especially affect the resident of hawkinge and the small village such as the constituent whose son be disabled and be unable to find job because the bus from his village start too late in the morning or the old constituent who be unable to visit theatre in canterbury because the last bus run before the end of the performance those be just couple of the many example could cite show why my constituency and kent as whole be cry out for properly support bus route have these route be vital to break down barrier to opportunity and unlock economic growth in our community welcome the fact that when labour bus services no bill be pass into law it will play major role in reform our break bus system hope that the administration at kent county council will take full advantage of the power the bill will give it to deliver the improvement in bus service that my constituent deserve thank my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson for secure this debate she know my constituency well and will be familiar with many of the issue that will raise erewash be at the geographic and dare say emotional heart of the east midland the halfway point between derby and nottingham long eaton which represent be scarcely on the map before the railway and ilkeston like the constituency of my hon friend the member for bournemouth east tom hayes use to have its own tram those place be define by industry and be inherently link to public transportation but by the middle of the century that legacy have be whittle away as all focus move towards the car for year ilkeston do not have train station at all but after year of cross party campaigning its new station open in however lot of people in ilkeston tell that the station have be miss opportunity service be once per hour mean that it be not as attractive to commuter as it could be ilkeston be in derbyshire but passenger can not even get train to derby from the station be pleased though to hear discussion about the maid marian line again that line would restore the link from nottinghamshire to the erewash valley line perhaps enable those new service connect mansfield and derby to call at ilkeston at present although the erewash valley line bear my constituency name it do not carry any local passenger service if it be bring into more frequent use maybe we could one day reopen the stapleford and sandiacre station if we be dream perhaps one day we could even bring back draycott and breaston station too in many way long eaton be fortunate to keep its train station after the the station have frequent service to many destination but there be still thing that it notably lack the ramp up to the platform be very steep and the lift work only when the station be staff which present real difficulty for my disabled constituent the platform be too short which can cause havoc for long train as only some door can open finally let address bus the bus use to link ilkeston cotmanhay and kirk hallam directly with the queen medical centre in nottingham one of our local major hospital before the covid pandemic the service be slash to just once per hour and afterwards it be slash altogether now there be no direct bus from ilkeston to the qmc and for anyone try to reach the hospital from kirk hallam by bus it be two hour trip with at least two change it mean get bus all the way into derby before take another bus in the opposite direction to nottingham it be madness be very familiar with my hon friend constituency and know that he be campaign for good transport link way before he become an mp on access to bus service small village such as egginton in my south derbyshire constituency be not serve by bus service at all do he agree that that truly ensure regional inequality across our country agree completely with my hon friend indeed for year the east midland have languish as my hon friend the member for derby north say in her opening remark on the bottom few rung of the table for regional transport funding be glad that time be change however the treasury billion commitment to transport in the east midland early this year be big than and colleague in the region could ever have dream be so excited to see what transformation that investment will bring and will fight every day to ensure that erewash see the benefit of it if we be to have long term change the east midland can not rely on one off award however we need consistent investment comprehensive planning reform overhaul and empower local government and in particular change to the treasury rule to end the flat refusal to spend outside london and the great south east those be all positive prospect bring forward by this government and look forward to see they become law rise order it might be helpful if indicate that will come to the front benchers at five minute past on three minute time limit there be very little time for intervention since be elect last july have become closely acquaint with the long distance london paddington to penzance line which number of my colleague have mention there be big storm in and we be properly cut off for eight week we could not get in or out of cornwall by rail because there be only one way to do so since then an awful lot have be do to improve the resilience of the line but phase will be vital to strengthen the vulnerable coastal section and maintain connectivity for cornwall cornwall see huge population increase in the summer with about million visitor but we lack reliable year round connection which constrain our economy and restrict growth as well as create social isolation many of our student must travel for over an hour on public transport to further education provider and travel between their apprenticeship and college be often impossible restrict their prospect as result of our devolution deal cornwall council obtain great transport power such as franchising and partnership agreement with local bus provider which have help and lead to an increase in bus patronage cornwall be the first rural area in england to introduce smart ticketing but that come at cost the council subsidise of the public transport network and it cost we an awful lot of money under the previous tory government the south west have some of the low identifiable expenditure on public transport at just per head the second low after the constituency of my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson welcome the government focus on long term investment in transport infrastructure include the fourfold increase in local transport grant the funding for pothole will be hugely important in cornwall which have more than mile of small road the investment will be crucial for cornwall economic growth cornwall chamber of commerce have say that transport connectivity be the top priority for the business it represent because our transport link really hold we back we use to receive eu funding of up to billion much of which be plough into transport because we do not have the funding from elsewhere we have branch line that would not exist have it not be for that money but the funding have dry up now that the share prosperity fund have finish so we need the investment to continue electrify the main line would really help currently there be branch line passenger service that run from truro to falmouth there be freight rail line at the end of it so just yard would open up so much for new industry such as critical mineral and would enable aggregate to be move around we have an airport that desperately need new public service obligation investment in transport infrastructure in cornwall be essential for our economic growth and success in the future be glad to be speak in this debate because far too many of my constituent be be hold back by our transport system on rail rugeley trent valley just over the border in the constituency of my hon friend the member for lichfield dave robertson he be no long in his place be striking example of what we be here to discuss two of the station three platform can be reach only by steep footbridge mean that wheelchair user parent with pram and people with limited mobility be effectively bar from get to birmingham and stafford one constituent tell that his friend who have mobility issue literally have to crawl up and down the stair to reach their connect train west midlands railway fully support instal lift but such major upgrade fall under network rail access for all programme for which demand be huge and funding be heavily oversubscribed with more than station compete network rail prioritise base on passenger number and the proximity of the next available accessible station that mean rugeley lose out to large hub nearby such as stafford although rugeley have be shortlist in the past other station have score higher under the system the reality be that the next allocation of access for all funding be still distant prospect in the meantime passenger be offer so call mitigation such as go forward to the next accessible station and be send back again or be provide with road transport at the operator discretion for many that be simply not viable or dignified option will my hon friend give way for very short intervention give your warning madam deputy speaker will not give way accessibility upgrade such as lift ramp and reliable step free route must not be treat as optional extras in town such as mine they be essential to dignity inclusion and fairness on bus cannock chase show why change be long overdue we be one of the most car dependent part of the country yet many still rely on bus over the year we have lose route into birmingham and the black country and service after pm and at weekend be rare in my part of the world we see stark evidence of public service run for private profit and pay for in grow inequality elderly resident tell that they can not reach appointment parent struggle to get child to school and worker have to turn down shift nationally bus service in the most deprived area of england have be cut time more than in the least deprived some community have be cut off altogether such as slitting mill just outside rugeley which have no service at all despite once have direct bus all the way to wolverhampton the government bus services no bill be immensely proud to serve on the bill committee and to support it last night will arrest and begin to reverse the long term decline that we have see for far too long whether it be the last bus that never come or the platform that can not be reach my constituent know what regional transport inequality look like welcome the labour government determination to put fairness and accessibility at the heart of transport policy will keep press to ensure that my constituent get the share of investment they deserve to grow our economy we need good connectivity in coastal community such as scarborough and whitby we be strike in the slow lane scarborough with its heritage culture and captivate coastline be popular tourist destination attract million visitor last year the train from scarborough to york be an essential transport link for visitor as well as commuter but with only one service an hour opportunity and growth be be choke off we need twice hourly service this proposal be back by york and north yorkshire mayor david skaith local business my constituent and lord blunkett who list the service increase as one of his rail priority in his report yorkshire plan for rail publish this year scarborough wonderful stephen joseph theatre have support call for twice hourly service state that audience member leave performance early to catch their train rather like its late production noises off this be farce we have business in scarborough and nearby seamer that be look to attract more employee but with such an irregular service these opportunity be simply out of reach for many people we have enough platform and enough demand for more regular rail service the operator transpennine express say that one of the barrier to provide twice hourly service be shortage of driver it insist that it must train its own driver on its own route would be grateful if the minister could address the issue of train driver in his closing remark and say whether he be explore new way to ensure that the local need for driver be meet welcome the news that york and north yorkshire combine authority will receive million in local transport grant capital funding over the next four year however the combine authority which cover huge geographical area be not part of the transport for city region so its settlement be not nearly as large as that of most combined authority will the hon lady give way on that point no be afraid have to carry on unless we equip our first labour rural metro mayor in york and north yorkshire with the economic firepower to deliver well bus and train we not only limit the opportunity for town like scarborough to contribute to economic growth but risk fail to break down barrier to opportunity in coastal community when we talk about regional transport inequality the east midland where be bear and have live most of my life come to mind as one of the clear example of such inequality as my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson have say over the past five year per head transport spend in the east midland have fall to just of the uk average the low of any region or nation as have already be say have we simply receive the english average we would have have billion more for our bus road and railway rail funding in the east midland be particularly unequal at per head in barely of the english average and third of what the west midland receive these be not just abstract figure they affect daily life they mean high car dependency low level of bus usage and sparse and unreliable rail network three quarter of our station be serve by only one train per hour or few this be what chronic under investment look like on the ground for my constituent as have be mention there have recently be positive commitment which welcome include the billion allocate to our east midlands mayor claire ward but we have to be honest with huge sum be spend elsewhere on the trans pennine upgrade east west rail and the low thames crossing to name but few fantastic project the money commit to the east midland will not address the long stand imbalance without purposeful intervention fear that the east midland relative position will simply worsen so what need to change first we need funding parity would like to see transparent path towards bring transport spend in the east midland up to the english average include on rail where the gap be deep secondly we need certainty we need long term multi year pipeline for road rail bus station and active travel investment rather than piecemeal one off project so that local authority and industry can plan properly thirdly would like to see housing growth match by transport capacity my constituency be deliver the housing that this government want to see and it be important that the transport be there as well finally must mention midland main line electrification the economic case be overwhelming it would unlock million worth of benefit and job in contrast keep the scheme under review risk million to million in additional cost my ask today be therefore straightforward please minister look at that scheme again meur ras madam deputy speaker congratulate my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson on secure this important debate to highlight the disparity in the effectiveness and adequacy of transport between different region would like to speak about my constituency of camborne redruth and hayle and to consider how specific issue affect travel in remote coastal area such as cornwall as my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham have mention particularly in relation to home to school transport because of cornwall geography be at the end of long peninsula it be characterise by remote community limited transport infrastructure and high proportion of small settlement which mean that deliver service be inherently more expensive the recently close fair funding review consult on update the system of distribution include assess local authority experience of deliver multiple service such as home to school transport as my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth again highlight the south west rank in the bottom half of regional transport expenditure ranking in yet cornwall face distinct geographical challenge it cover very large area with dispersed population which result in long school journey as many pupil live far from their near school there be also limit public transport option in rural area necessitate dedicated school transport these place base characteristic be compound by pressure on the special educational need and disability system with rise number of pupil require specialist transport yet the funding formula do not fully reflect the complexity and cost of provide the service road in remote coastal and rural area be more vulnerable to weather relate disruption mean transport service require extra contingency planning and resilience funding seasonal pressure exacerbate these challenge too with visitor and seasonal worker increase congestion and wear on infrastructure add to maintenance cost and planning complexity when he get to his foot hope the minister will be able to address some of the particular issue affect remote coastal area such as cornwall and would appreciate further discussion with he on this matter particularly give cornwall distinct devolution complication be quite tempt to stand up this afternoon and just say the word pothole over and over again for three solid minute as the peculiarity of such an approach might really bring home to the minister who know have be do his good on these matter quite how strongly my constituent feel about the state of their road the government do give cheshire east several million pound more in this year budget to deal with road maintenance backlog than in recent year which be very much appreciate by my constituent however the reality be that year of chronic underfunding have leave my road in catastrophic state can not emphasise enough how dark dangerous and worrying rural road be the number of young people who die on the road in my constituency be absolutely horrific similarly can not emphasise enough that we need separate funding for significant safety upgrade as well as dramatic increase to the road maintenance pot as soon as the government be able to do so there be another matter concern road in my constituent that want to draw attention to grit might sound like trivial thing to those live in an urban area but grit in rural area be absolutely critical our road get low level of use and the result be that they freeze and stay frozen for long period of time one impact of my local authority have have so many financial challenge over the past year have be reduction in gritting there be school in my rural area that have no pavement outside they and the road in front of they be completely and utterly ungritted when those child be drop off at school they be put into road alongside car which have not be grit at all headteacher do their good to mitigate the associate risk by not demand that parent bring their child in on time so the lack of safety feature not only put child at risk but undermine their education let contrast that with london where automatic number plate recognition camera help to shut road off completely at specific time of day find it stagger that we have such complete contrast in treatment of course want child in london to be safe this be not about take thing away from london school but it be very much about child in my constituency as well as old people and other have the same access and safety as everyone else briefly give that have only second leave want to touch on northern rail and the complete lack of sunday service in my constituency the strike have be go on for year and we desperately need the issue to be resolve sandbach station rail accessibility include the lack of an accessible lift at the station be huge issue echo point make by colleague about the importance of fund such thing properly lastly there have be reduction in bus in my local area over the past year we must improve on that desperate situation will do my good to speak at high speed madam deputy speaker want to say few word about my hon friend the member for nottingham south lilian greenwood she be an outstanding minister and the department loss be the whips office gain she will be much miss on the transport front bench be grateful too to my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson for secure this debate she and represent constituency in the squeeze midland region home to million people that have historically be deny fair share of funding and political attention as have be note already the east midland receive the low transport funding per head of any region although the west midland hold that unhappy status until recently the rail line between birmingham and nottingham be slow mile for mile than that between manchester and leeds the west midland have the low share of public transport journey of any english region follow by the east midland that fuel congestion road safety problem and pothole birmingham road be special case we have one of the last private finance initiative contract in the country when originally issue local government austerity and the high inflation of the early be not foresee the previous government try to withdraw support for the pfi contract without clear plan which be rule unlawful know that the new minister will be look at that closely and look forward to work with he to get fair deal for birmingham most public transport journey be by bus and half the industry income now come from public funding yet public accountability lag behind this summer national express announce major change to the and route people in allens cross and part of the new frankley estate lose their direct connection to birmingham and some old resident no long have direct bus access to the queen elizabeth hospital be grateful to the hundred of people who sign petition include one that organise have meet national express and transport for west midlands and hope that we can find way forward significant investment have be announce for commuter rail have speak frequently in this house about rebuild king norton station as part of midland rail hub in the interest of time will only say how grateful be that minister listen hope that we can make progress on restore that service frequency finally we must be ambitious birmingham corporation tramways once run service to my constituency the original vision for revitalise metro include loop serve northfield longbridge frankley and rubery that vision be right and hope that we can find funding for feasibility study for south birmingham extension regional transport inequality hinder economic growth and deny opportunity to my constituent be glad that the house have have the chance to debate this issue think this be my stop so will commend the hon gentleman for his timekeepe and the speed with which he include all that that bring we to the front benchers remember that we would like to leave some time for the member who introduce the debate to wind up call the liberal democrat spokesperson be all too conscious at transport question this morning not only to ensure that do not after last night scolding repeat the heresy of you or yours madam deputy speaker but to keep my question brief consequently do not have time to put on the record for the third time in less than year formal welcome on behalf of my party to the new shadow transport secretary therefore notwithstanding the fact that the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden be no long in the chamber formally congratulate he on his elevation as former transport minister the right hon gentleman know all about the transformative effect of transport have only recently hop aboard the overnight shuttle from durham to basildon on that tortuous journey from the north of england to the south east he would have glimpse the huge inequality in transport provision across our country be it train or bus road or air travel where people live or their business be situate have massive effect on their mobility mobility the ability to move from to and all point in between be key to modern economy and cohesive society the statistic paint stark picture of to coin phrase two tier system last year for example transport spending in london be over per head compare with under per head in the east midland new research from transport for the north reveal that over million people in england face high risk of social exclusion specifically because of inadequate transport system that represent increase an extra million people since in the north east well over of resident face high risk of transport relate social exclusion compare with below in london and who be the exclude it will come as no surprise that as transport for the north have highlight it be disproportionately low income household unpaid carer the old and the disabled the very people our transport system should be help the most be the one face its great barrier it be not just the north of england suffer from these inequality minehead in somerset for example be virtually cut off the railway station close in and my hon friend the member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour tell that the no bus appear to run on whim in stratford upon avon stagecoach have stop run bus in the evening and at weekend and there be no direct train service between the home of shakespeare and london undermine the town tourist and cultural economy transport be of course key to our tourist industry that be why in cornwall the new lib dem council have cancel the previous tory administration plan to sell off newquay airport but it now need more help than be currently be offer by the government to make the critical investment the airport so badly need investment in transport be key even in london where transport for london be the envy of the rest of the country more investment be need repeat disruption on the district line be cause by some of the infrastructure be up to year old accord to it sound grim but as my constituent be get tired of hear say we in wimbledon and the rest of london do not know how lucky we be just imagine live in region where service be sparse or non existent bus route be cut station have be close and the few train run be routinely delay be address my remark to the minister for whom have high regard and no little sympathy because the problem with regional transport inequality be clearly not of his making nor his government but of the past tory administration take bus for example where deregulation allow private operator to cream off the profitable route and abandon the rest between and over billion passenger journey be lose in the north west alone bus route be reduce from nearly in to half that number in sadly however the problem still continue my hon friend the member for eastleigh liz jarvis in the south east of england tell that three bus service have be cancel since last summer in the south west and north east of small town be now identify as transport desert or at risk of become so do not doubt the government good intention evidence by the bus services no bill but in some respect thing be get bad the government decision to increase the bus fare cap from to for example will only accelerate the decline in bus usage hit those who be already struggle the most the minister will rightly point to the bus services no bill and its many excellent provision but as with the soon to be publish rail bill no amount of legislation will solve the issue of regional transport inequality without the necessary investment as we see with high speed and more recently the spending review those money be not forthcoming the electrification of the midland main line from london to sheffield have now be cancel while at dawlish the critical work to protect the vital paddington to penzance main line from the sea have be put on hold despite the very real risk to regional connectivity the same be true of our road network where for example the promise widening of the which would have support the creation of new home in the chelmsford area have be cancel as the minister be fond of tell there be no magic money tree which be why the only way to address regional transport inequality be to grow the economy growth that be impede by the very inequality that growth would help to address that be why the pump must be prim with more investment in our transport system and far more ambitious approach to growth which can be achieve not by wish on star or by the pm tie himself in knot with his red line over europe but by boldly re engage with the eu and thereby complete the virtuous circle of an integrate transport system drive by and drive dynamic and grow economy end by thank the hon member for derby north catherine atkinson for secure this important debate and all member for their excellent contribution call the shadow minister join the liberal democrat spokesperson in thank the hon member for derby north catherine atkinson for secure the debate it give we an opportunity to talk about the chasm between the government grand promise and the grim reality for passenger business and community as have be ably demonstrate by many of the contribution from back benchers do not have time to do justice to all those who have make contribution will leave that task to the minister will move quickly on to road and the government record on road which have come in for some criticism today the infrastructure spending review that the conservatives be responsible for in the run up to the last election be the road investment strategy which run from to that be some billion of investment deliver major upgrade unlock infrastructure to enable new home for our constituent improve freeport and airport link and improve safety with refuge area build on smart motorway we now move to with which be labour opportunity to outshine we have it do so absolutely not be mark by the killing of key enhancement which will come to and instead of action we have target here and consultation there but it be very light on delivery we have government of review and policy paper and that speak to wide truth about the government it be lead by lawyer prime minister who value process over political judgment just think about his approach to sack our ambassador to washington the prime minister original defence be that the process be follow there be no political judgment we can see that in the transport policy too what we need be not process we do not need further target here and consultation there we need action we need action on the improvement billion project the scheme have be sign off the housing have be clear and business have be relocate but it be scrap without warn by this government the be core artery for essex and south suffolk what about the regional inequality of that region my hon friend say the magic word essex do he support the transport for london extension of concessions bill that have table tfl run to shenfield reading epping watford cheshunt and amersham way beyond the boundary of greater london the bill would require tfl to enable any local authority that be serve by tfl route or by route to which tfl concessionary scheme apply to opt in to the concessionary fare scheme include the freedom pass for our old age pensioner be aware that my hon friend bill do not make call on the public purse at least on the treasury and it be for local authority to opt into the scheme should they wish to it sound like very exciting project and one that should be develop far mention the in east anglia but there be also the near great yarmouth the conservatives include dualle to north tuddenham which be go on at the moment declare an interest as it be in my constituency as be the dualling of the brundall to blofield stretch of the labour come into power and cancel all further improvement the shadow minister talk about the which run through my constituency would he agree that the million be spend on the improvement of the thickthorn junction in our area will make huge difference compare to the million waste by norfolk county council run by his party on road that have not have an inch of tarmac lay the hon gentleman intervention give the opportunity to raise the proverbial eyebrow at his claim credit for secure million for the thickthorn roundabout when that have be in process for many year before he be elect as for the million he mention think he mean the western link road which would be huge improvement at the moment we have the equivalent of the for norwich but it be miss one section of mile the conservatives be squarely behind finish it be surprised to hear that labour do not support the resident of norwich in similar way will move on to what labour have do it have cancel the further improvement on the particularly at the other end towards peterborough that be just another example of where east anglia have be ignore by labour bus be the most popular form of public transport and the most important one in area of high deprivation they be particularly important for poor member of society the young elderly and disabled the conservatives recognise that we recognise that price matter so the last government introduce the bus fare cap and our manifesto commitment at the last election be to maintain it throughout the course of this parliament because we recognise how popular and useful it be in increase bus ridership when labour come to power it have choice it could back passenger or it could back the union one of its first shameful act in government be to give pay rise to aslef train driver who be already the well pay in europe pay for by increase in bus fare for passenger around the country that speak to wide truth when it come to it labour be the party of the union and not of the people rise on that point will give way do the shadow minister agree with his predecessor the last conservative rail minister huw merriman who say this whilst it legitimate to debate the term of the deal the demonisation of train driver and those onboard and at station who carry out difficult and skilled job for the safety of passenger be completely unfair these people work hard and should be show more respect have no problem with the union make demand after all they be represent the interest of their member what complain about be the government give way to they at the expense of the general public on train we have get the cancel project as well the midland main line electrification have be cancel which have lead to lay off and the loss of expertise it be also cause problem for the procurement of new bi mode train because we no long have any certainty as to whether the line will be electrify at dawlish the conservative government complete phase to of the improvement and reinforcement of the line phase be all that remain what have the government do they have kick it into the long grass as be mention by the hon member for newton abbot martin wrigley for which give he credit back in east anglia the hon member for south norfolk ben goldsborough highlight the need for the ely junction and haughley junction project in cambridgeshire and suffolk to be advanced yet they have be ignore by the government will the shadow minister give way will not because be run out of time have already give way to the hon gentleman what be the big plan it be one of nationalisation for railway we must look at the government motive what do they think it be go to do it be not about unify track and train because that be already in the williams shapps review that be go to happen without nationalisation be it about reduce fare if so it be backfire because nationalise train company fare be rise above inflation be it about increase efficiency one would hope so but through the government nationalisation process they be decapitate the management team that drive efficiency in the individual rail company be it about increase passenger number the inconvenient truth for labour be that under privatisation passenger ridership on the railway double because the company be incentivise to chase ridership that be drive by increase open access route yet the government have oppose every single application for open access since the election be it to save money if so they be not do very good job on south western railway one of the first to be nationalise since the election they waste million on infrastructure overspend with the roll stock leasing company due to government negotiate incompetence the truth be that the government be do it because it be an article of labour faith faith in the big state and also key demand of the union how have it go for they as we have hear aslef have already get pay rise and the rmt be strike now next time when gbr be finish that strike will be national the government be one year in we have hear in the debate of cancel scheme after cancel scheme we have also hear that price have increase and that money have be divert from passenger to union pay that have do nothing for regional inequality save for the industrial action that be spread from london and engulf the rest of the country it

main line and progress the derby junction scheme which will improve safety reduce delay and support house building we be also commit to deliver the newark bypass subject to planning consent recognise the frustration that hon member and their constituent feel about the electrification of the midland main line but we have have to prioritise our funding on scheme that will make the great difference for passenger and economic growth as soon as possible further electrification of the midland main line have be pause but will be keep under review as part of our pipeline for future funding the new train however will increase seat capacity and will mark step change in passenger experience member have advocate passionately for other scheme in their local area while can not address every scheme

there yet but now we have government who have we drive in the right direction on track to unlock the economic potential across the whole country question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider regional transport inequality suicide prevention call lee pitcher who will speak for around minute beg to move that this house have consider suicide prevention before begin want to share for the benefit of anyone watch or anyone in this chamber who may ever need it that help be available crisis mental health support can be access by call nhs and select option or by call the samaritans whose badge proudly wear today on can not thank the backbench business committee enough for grant this debate in the main chamber the committee recognition of just how important it be for this issue to be hear here be in itself hugely symbolic let start with the worker who be on stand by who in the early hour of the morning be call to deal with the death of man from suicide who be find in the tree alone on some open land that worker have deal with the immediate response then reflect and think about the true impact of manage that situation he fail to sleep for the rest of the week and never once sleep well again when on his stand by duty to the family of john he be massive west ham fan who love motörhead and the genius of pink floyd his mum who find he that day experience that thing no parent should ever have to endure their baby who they once cradle leave this world before they that worker on stand by that cousin of john that be we get that call about john as we prepare to go to another family member funeral that chill call that no one ever want to receive john have decide he could no long go on live with his demon and feel that the only way to gain peace be to end his life right now as we speak today there be many other johns out there make similar choice like our john they will be someone son dad brother uncle cousin friend or colleague from that day on we vow as family that the good thing we could do in john memory be to ensure that we help show people different path so that that dread call could never happen to anyone else whether it be by raise fund through marathon maximise our use of social medium to highlight support or for secure this debate we be all do everything we can for john while none of this can bring john back to his gorgeous sister jacqui who be watch this in australia or to my auntie and uncle there will be some comfort that his personal fight may prevent other pain in the future today use the privilege of be elect to this place will use my voice to try to make difference have share my story because want everyone to remember how common unfortunately these situation be so many of we will tragically get that heartbreaking call about family member friend or colleague at some stage in our life be also share this because just by raise the subject in this place we give suicide prevention national platform from which we can strive to share good practice and find new way to take action to make difference and save life compare with other leading cause of death suicide remain poorly understand the stigma that still cling to it stop people reach out and isolate the family leave behind break that stigma require we to talk openly and honestly in place such as this chamber as be sure you agree madam deputy speaker there be not many subject on which simply have debate have the potential to save life but today we have that opportunity and my hope be that hon member will use it as chance to shift perception and push back stigma and perhaps it will be hear by someone who need it on september every year we mark world suicide prevention day it be chance to remember those we have lose to stand with those who be struggle and to commit to do all we can to reduce the number of life lose this year theme set by the samaritans be interrupt suicidal thought and that be what we must do in this chamber interrupt the silence interrupt the stigma and push for change the statistic be stark in people across the uk lose their life to suicide it remain the lead cause of death for man under and for man and woman age to and suicide among teenage girl and young woman have nearly double in recent year in doncaster where live suicide rate be above the national average life be lose between and in the same period in north lincolnshire in which the isle of axholme lie life be lose every life lose be tragedy but what those number do not show be the ripple effect every statistic represent family and network of friend colleague and acquaintance who be all affect suicide may often happen alone but it never happen in isolation however suicide be not inevitable it be preventable before speak about the ask have of the minister and the government let touch on the importance of mental health and building resilience in early life mental health problem often start to develop in our teenage year and even if they do not reach crisis point until much later in life we need to do something which be why we can not leave these conversation until it be too late we need to start talk to child about mental health from an early age this have to be do carefully and in an age appropriate way but just as we teach our child about eat well and stay active to look after their physical health we should be help they to build resilience and wellbee for their mental health whether that be through mindfulness by learn how to manage stress or by know where to turn if they need help just as importantly we need to teach young people again at an appropriate time that seek help with suicidal thought be not weakness and be not something they need to face alone it be medical issue and it need medical intervention and support there should be no more shame in reach out for mental health support than there be in get prescription for insulin or pick up an inhaler if we can make those lesson part of grow up we can give the next generation far strong chance of live healthy hopeful life that be why it be so important that this government be commit to put mental health professional in every school help to build that early resilience and understanding that help be already in place for nearly million pupil and it will be there for every child during this parliament at this stage want to give shout out for with in mind for the amazing work it do in my area will concentrate on three key area where would like the government to take action the first area be mandatory suicide prevention training for first responder and well mental health awareness across frontline service our police fire and ambulance service be amazing and their crew be often the first to respond when someone be in suicidal crisis in the year up to march fire and rescue service be call to more than suicide attempt east midlands ambulance service alone respond to more than incident in and the north east ambulance service respond to more than incident three time the number from just four year before the fact be that training on this matter be just not consistent and we have an opportunity to do more we know that training work evaluation show that with suicide prevention knowledge confidence and attitude improve significantly after training gps who complete training be more likely to identify people at risk equip first responder with the skill to spot the sign start compassionate conversation and make an intervention will save life the second area be well research into demographic gap in suicide death we know that the risk be not evenly share man be three time more likely to die by suicide than woman and man in deprive area be five time more likely to do so too often man be tell to man up or tough it out and they be less likely to seek help confide or access service until it be too late however this be about not just how man be teach to act but how people react to man seek help research show that nine in man who die by suicide have be in touch with statutory service in the year before their death whether it be at through primary care or even through the criminal justice system yet too many opportunity to help be miss if we be serious about tackle the big killer as the government have promise we need clear evidence base programme of research into how suicide risk present in man and how service can respond more effectively without that the mental health strategy risk fail the very group it need to help the most this be not just about gender gap people in the most deprived area be twice as likely to die by suicide autistic people face three time the risk of their peer gay and bisexual adult face twice the risk for tran people the risk of suicide attempt be four and half time high and for tran youth the risk be nearly six time high there be huge difference in death by suicide across ethnic group across region and between different kind of employment and educational background these difference need to be study and understand just as we would for any disease that affect different demographic in different area by study the different demographic affect we can learn about the cause risk factor preventive or protective factor and path to recovery the third area be rapid and ambitious roll out of mental health hub after next year pilot these hub could be transformative local community base and accessible without referral or appointment that be exactly the kind of frictionless support we need to offer when someone be suicidal every barrier be potential barrier too far no wrong door no delay if someone ask for help the system must help they alongside that we must support the voluntary and community organisation that be already save life every single day such as samaritans mind andy man club james place man sheds and local group such as the jackson hope foundation and the shed on the isle in my constituency they provide the human connection that prevent suicide but they be too often leave to rely on their own fundraising if we be serious about prevention government must partner with they not leave they struggle for survival the government have commit in their manifesto to tackle the big killer include suicide and to deliver the suicide prevention strategy urge ministers to go fast and far for some people listen today time be already run short prevention be not just well than cure for suicide it be the only chance that some people will ever get as say the theme for world suicide prevention day be interrupt suicidal thought it be the responsibility of each and every one of we to interrupt with training with research with service that open door in every community suicide be not inevitable it be preventable with the right action we can and we will save life on monday will be carry the baton of hope take part in relay across my constituency alongside many other to raise fund and awareness for suicide prevention that baton be symbol physical icon of mental health it be reminder that hope can be carry share and pass on to the next person our task in this house be to ensure that hope be meet with action so that few family face the grief of lose love one

there be so much more that be go to say but will move on to my ask of the government be proud of the work that the government have carry out so far from expand mental health support team in school to

and congratulate my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett on her powerful speech welcome the conversation that we as country be have about mental health because every community have story where life have be lose and my constituency be no different helena markey go to my school de ferrers and be in the year below still remember her smile which would light up any room on september she pass away after jump into the path of vehicle she be just it shock our school community it shock our local community young life with so much potential and so much to give to the world be take away from we week before helena die she receive her exam feedback and be consider her option for year she become very distressed about the result and would later go on to take her own life helena parent be completely unaware of just how upset she have become have be work with helena incredible parent glen and sharron markey since my election and have be support they on their campaign which aim to change the department for education guidance to school to ensure that they notify parent if pupil become distressed during their result feedback glen and sharron believe that just simple phone call to they about helena distress would have mean that they could have go and pick she up from school and that would have save her life they could have talk she through that situation and get through it together we be seek meeting with the new schools minister to ensure that what happen to helena do not happen to any other young person would be grateful if the minister could use his good office to assist with that the key to mental health support be talk and be open with each other about the challenge that we all face it be about not just the investment that we need in mental health crisis service but front load that into preventive support that be why believe that the government plan for mental health hub and the increase in the number of mental health counsellor be so important locally there be so many people who support other to open up about their mental health include the sexual abuse rape advice centre or sarac burton ymca burton and district mind bac and those like andy man club that be look to set up in burton and uttoxeter pay tribute to all those organisation they save life every single day even if they do not know it we owe it to helena her family and every young person in this country to do well to create culture where no one suffer in silence where family be keep inform and where the right support be there at the right time ask the minister to reaffirm our share commitment to build system that catch young people before they fall because behind every statistic be life family and future if by make change we can prevent just one more family from experience the heartbreak that happen to the markeys then it will be worth it be grateful to my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher for secure the debate and congratulate he on his very touching speech the clear message come from the house today be that suicide be preventable defeat stigma be essential and the more that we can raise this issue in parliament the more we can do to help remove that stigma this government inherit mental health crisis more than million people who be in need of mental health support be not get the care that they so desperately require the suicide rate be now high than it have be at any time in the century the pledge by ministers to ensure that mental health get the same attention and focus as physical health be an important one it be talk about for year when the conservative party be in power but there be little progress genuinely hope that under this government thing will finally change with that in mind will my hon friend the minister update the house on the progress be make to tackle mental health waiting list research from rethink mental illness have show that time as many people have to wait month or more for mental health treatment compare with the wait for treatment for physical health it be necessary to discuss mental health provision in this debate after all the link between suicide and mental illness be well establish do my hon friend agree that we should also look at the impact on people mental health of online gambling which be responsible for between and suicide year figure repeat in our health and social care committee report my constituent jack lose his son arthur to gambling relate suicide age only after only six month it be tragic situation do my hon friend agree that gambling should be see as public health issue that in future it should be regulate not by the department for culture media and sport but by the department of health and social care and that the dhsc should launch public health strategy to tackle gambling as cause of suicide agree with my hon friend that not all suicide be link solely to mental health be about to say that various social issue need to be tackle as well it be it be important that we do not see suicide prevention solely through the prism of mental health indeed many of those who die by suicide have either have no contact with mental health service or show no sign of mental ill health it be also important to point out that not everyone who die by suicide have diagnose mental illness for those at risk of suicide complex range of individual relationship community or societal factor can be at play as the suicide prevention strategy make clear common risk factor that be link to suicide include physical illness financial difficulty and economic adversity gambling alcohol and drug misuse social isolation and loneliness and domestic abuse although address suicide prevention can include mental health the strategy emphasise that it also go well beyond these issue if we see suicide prevention just as mental health issue those people in our community who may not meet the criterion for mental health diagnosis but be still in acute distress can end up be forget perceive suicide just as mental health issue also put the responsibility mainly on mental health service when in reality local authority employer school the criminal justice system and wide society all have role to play when we talk about suicide prevention we should therefore also talk about early intervention in school university place of work and community group it be worth mention the great work do by charity many name have already be mention congratulate the recently open ashford safe haven which be base at william harvey hospital it offer walk in service every evening for people who be in crisis or feel they be head towards crisis few month ago visit the safe haven and meet some of the staff to hear about the support they provide and how they help to create stay well and crisis plan as well as support people to access other service and organisation that may be useful to they it be great resource for people in our community and hope that the east kent hospital trust be successful in its bid for funding for round the clock walk in service work with suicide prevention charity can complement the service offer by the nhs and bridge gap in provision we should also ensure that the health system become more effective in signpost the service that be offer by suicide prevention charity while will always lobby for meaningful change in the mental health system also know that talk about suicide prevention just as another issue for our mental health service risk narrow the conversation and exclude other who might need help hope that today debate have help to make it easy for those watch who might need help now or in the future to get the right help at the right time congratulate my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher on secure this debate will focus my contribution on the suicide risk during the perinatal period which be the period from pregnancy through to the year after child birth have speak in the house before about the tragic death of my wonderful friend sophie who take her own life four year ago leave behind her husband and her three little girl age six three and just week old have be feel the sadness of her death again this week look at the photo of she young now set off to primary school for the first time beam with pride and know sophie would have be so proud too still vividly recall the shock of the moment learn that she have die when the message come through from her husband it be only after we lose she that learn just what risk there be of suicide in this period of life one in four people experience some form of post natal depression or anxiety which be still poorly recognise as an issue generally and it be something campaign on the vast majority go on to recover but for some people it be very serious and for some it be so unbearable that they end their life the lead cause of death for woman in that period from six week to year after the birth of their child be suicide the maternal mental health alliance have delve into the datum and find some more alarming detail in particular the persistent social economic and racial inequality in who die and who survive woman in the most deprived area have much high rate of death black woman be more than twice as likely to die as white woman and woman of asian and mixed ethnic background also face elevated risk with these risk and sophie death in mind want to offer three reflection the first be that we be all vulnerable each and every one of we of the woman who die by suicide nearly half have know mental health problem but the rest do not it be time when the social pressure be really great people expect you to be revel in the joy of the new baby but the reality for many be that there be challenge in care for the baby not enough sleep not enough company feeling of loneliness failure and guilt and the loss of the sense of self the old you that you know before have child which you fear be go forever this can make it very difficult period for many woman include people who have not struggle with their mental health before it be so important that we be all cognisant of this in ourselves and other around we my second reflection be that we all carry responsibility to each other still look back on sophie death and blame myself ask whether could have do more as paul doble fascinating therapist work in my constituency of aylesbury recently put it to the reality be that we can not prevent every suicide but we must never be afraid to try the real question be how we support people well when they be suicidal know that our compassion care and presence may not remove every risk but can make life more bearable and our question may be the one that interrupt their suicidal thought and lead they to different choice again that be something we must all be cognisant of my third point be that the government have to keep take suicide risk and suicide prevention really seriously as know they do hope we will hear more on the suicide prevention strategy from the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend the member for glasgow south west dr ahmed who welcome to his place we know that the care suicidal person receive can make big difference we have some fantastic specialist perinatal mental health service but have hear from so many woman who can not access they suicide risk need to be assess in all the routine maternity care woman receive and support give if necessary the same be true of so many other part of the nhs and other public service where action can make the difference between life and death the role of public health intervention in this for example social and emotional learning programme in school be crucial too conscious of time will end it there but hope that this world suicide prevention day be turning point in save life and tackle this immense challenge in our society thank my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher for secure this very important debate may be etch on my memory for two very different reason first the elation of may and the election of the first labour government in year and then just few week later the death by suicide of good friend this debate be not just personal to but be of great importance for far too many of my constituent accord to department of health and social care statistic cumberland have the second high suicide rate in england over one in five adult in carlisle have be diagnose with depression place we sixth high in england and wales my constituency be home to large rural and farming population and we know that rural isolation be major contributor to poor mental health and suicide risk pay particular tribute to the work of the royal agricultural benevolent organisation which provide tailor mental health support to our farming community also highlight the work of field nurse across the rural north specialist nurse who visit auction mart to support farmer their staff andtheir family with their physical and mental health support group be also make huge difference andy man club which have be

overhaul the mental health act through the mental health bill and to invest in mental health in school with nearly million young people gain access to support this year those be important reform and hope that they will be match by continue investment in the community base service that have touch on on occasion like this feel that our house and this chamber be at their good it be incumbent on we all to unite to ensure that no matter where someone live be it in community that be prosper or one face hardship or in city in village or on farm they be able to access the support that they need when they need it it be an honour to take part in the debate which be so powerfully open by my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher be grateful to colleague for

disproportionate effect that suicide have on those with autism accord to the national autistic society of autistic adult have experience suicidal thought nine time high than for the general population the society also report that as much as of people who die by suicide have either an autism diagnosis or autism trait those figure be shocking and demand action the insight and voice of autistic people and their family which hear at the roundtable and in further conversation have be invaluable in shape my understanding of the scale of the challenge and the need for action recent research from autism action the university of cambridge and bournemouth university the large study of autism and suicide to date provide further insight almost autistic people take part the study identify loneliness hopelessness and feeling of failure as key driver of suicidal thought many report difficulty in get the support they need long waiting time for diagnosis and lack of post diagnostic help our national strategy do recognise autistic people as priority group but there be more to do to ensure that recognition translate into practical action an update suicide prevention strategy should specifically address the need of autistic people and the next autism strategy should explicitly consider suicidality with the two approach work hand in hand rather than separately while there be more to be do nationally to address mental health issue be proud that local organisation in bracknell be already lead the way walks for wellbeing and sandhurst health walks youthline and create hope stepping stones recovery college sandhurst counselling service which be very happy to say be back up and run after difficult year andy man club and the crowthorne and wokingham without man shed and of course

pitcher for secure this debate on what think we can all agree be critical national public health issue it be timely debate give yesterday world suicide prevention day promote by the wonderful samaritans who do so much good work and whose badge be proud to be wear today figure from the house of commons library highlight the previous long term decline in suicide up to the year have see some reversal in recent year with see the high number since it be right therefore that when the government commit in our manifesto last year to renew drive to tackle the big killer suicide be include the recently publish year health plan set out how the government intend to put into practice the aim of transform our mental health system so that support be available when people need it very much welcome the commitment to cross government approach to suicide prevention which mirror the successful strategy that have see in my time in local government have be pleased since my election last year to have be able to work with an excellent charity that have be mention by other gamble with life to highlight the troubling link between gambling and suicide with the office for health improvement and disparities estimate that there be up to gambling relate suicide each year agree with both gambling for life and my hon friend the member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman that the responsibility for gambling should be transfer to the department of health and social care and that there should be investigation of all relate suicide and lesson learn from every case so that we can prevent future death at present coroner do not always correctly identify the link between gambling and suicide and that need to change hope that ministers will give full consideration to both those call local suicide prevention strategy have crucial role to play in my previous life be cabinet member for health on lambeth council we launch our own local suicide prevention strategy with the aim of bring down the number of suicide which see the council target support at the group identify by evidence as the most at risk old man the community and range of other we roll out suicide prevention training to everyone free of charge so that all resident be able to access it but aim the support particularly as other have say at key organisation in touch with at risk group in the borough the training be all about how to have effective potentially lifesave conversation with people in safe way and we see great take up crucially the council also launch borough wide mental health campaign aim at support people on their mental health journey and at provide advice and wellbee information on how to access service at the right time that period see decline in the number of suicide which hope will continue in my constituency pay tribute to the newly constitute dartford safe haven little like the ashford safe haven mention by my hon friend the member for ashford sojan joseph which work closely with gps provide walk in service out of hour with the crisis support that so many need also pay tribute to north kent mind which supplement local mental health service provide vital additional help for those with mental health support need let we all commit to make suicide prevention successful national mission thank the backbench business committee for grant this debate and my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher for secure it and for make his opening remark in such an amazing way we hear the devastating number and the personal experience of the impact that suicide have have on our community and on ourselves these people be important to we and hope by discuss this difficult subject not only can we offer comfort and support but provide the hope that we can put in place improvement to prevent someone else from take their own life want to speak about two friend my childhood friend who lose her dad to suicide when we be just in our teen and one who make the decision to take his own life just couple of month ago it be not until my friend funeral in july that reflect that while those suicide be more than three decade apart the similarity between the two man who make that decision be stark they be both man in their early successful and run their own business they be amazing family man who be well respected in their work and in their social circle yet they still both make that ultimate decision to take their own life leave those leave behind to unpack their grief and sorrow with the override question why in the face of such loss we often search for answer something to help we make sense of the silence and the unanswered question while no single explanation can ever truly account for an individual decision pattern begin to emerge when we look more closely at the broad picture we can look at age and gender and the risk of suicide be high among man age between and it be three time more common among man than woman gap that only continue to grow we can look regionally too between and the east midland have suicide rate of death per people place we above the national average and make we the fifth high of the english region we also need to look nationally and we have to create some hope local authority develop strategy to prevent suicide but the funding for voluntary service have sadly go awry in recent year we need the much more important national debate we can look at the limit of exist mental health support and the reality that nearly third of people who die by suicide be in contact with mental health service in the month lead up to their death those be of course important insight but they be just insight just statistic we have to search for answer to this difficult question although we might never know why someone decide to take their own life what matter be what we do with the information that we do know we know that we have to build resilience for young people in school teach our young people how to promote good mental health and wellbee in themselves we need to equip people with the language to talk about how they feel the confidence to ask for help and the tool to support themselves and each other through the inevitable challenge in their life we can also look to our local organisation such as the leg up project in my constituency its core philosophy be about build resilience and tackle loneliness and isolation the government commitment to transform mental health service with neighbourhood mental health centre be fantastic start but it will mean nothing if we be not give people the tool that they need to communicate to get themselves there in the first place prevention of death by suicide will come from continued conversation grow understanding of the mental health landscape and hear the voice of those whom we have lose and those of we struggle now those voice be the one that truly matter we now come to the front benchers and call the liberal democrat spokesperson dr danny chambers we have three doctor on the front benches thank you madam deputy speaker always say that real doctor treat more than one specie thank the hon member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher for secure the debate and speak so emotively as so many hon member have today know from personal experience of talk about loss due to suicide in this chamber that the pain never go away no matter how long ago it be particularly commend the hon member for north west leicestershire amanda hack for speak about such recent bereavement which be very difficult thing to do other hon member have mention that only one in four people who take their own life be know to clinical mental health service that be why the charity and community organisation be so important recently visit the winchester branch of the samaritans and meet wayne fletcher the director it be so impressive and inspiring to see the number of volunteer involve in make sure that there be hour access for someone who need help in the darkest and loneliest time in the middle of the night and early in the morning someone can pick up the phone and volunteer will be wait to speak to someone it be incredible other hon member have mention the men shed two week ago visit the men shed in alresford its lease be up so we will work with the town council to find it new location the connection the friendship the sense of purpose and the mentorship be vital and it become lifesave community have message from fellow vet in winchester alison moores she say that her year old son sam take his own life early this year she tell at the weekend go with three of his school friend and their mum to sam grave see year old cry at the grave of their good friend be heartbreaking the loss of my son be so horrific can even begin to describe it we have raise over for papyrus but they still need more hope we ve make difference in save another child life we know that charity fundraising be hard than ever in the current economic climate and that all three of the organisation have mention plus other rely on the generosity of the public and the people who be work so hard to fundraise for they would like to ask in the most constructive way possible and with no party political agenda because know all hon member care deeply about this issue and that the minister have genuine commitment to suicide prevention about the government decision to end the voluntary community and social enterprise suicide prevention grant that funding support organisation such as samaritans papyrus and the men sheds which all play vital role in reach people who may never come into contact with mental health service be there any scope through cross party pressure or engagement with treasury colleague to look again at how we can sustain support for those lifesave organisation at time when suicide be at year high finish by pay tribute to archie pond year old constituent of mine who take his own life last year last month meet his father martyn who have be relentlessly fundraise for young minds be always so impressed that someone can turn that sort of heartbreak into something so positive one of my core team be retire clinical psychologist peter wilcock who help so much before the general election and have do so especially since be make the mental health spokesperson put on record my thank to he for his effort and his invaluable expertise on this subject thank the hon member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher he honour john by secure the debate all hon member who have speak have honour respectively the people they hold so dear in the most powerful way possible by turn personal grief into public purpose therefore thank they all for give their time to speak there be tiktok video that go viral it open with young woman energetically and innocently ask be honest who do you call whenever you at your low who that one person the stitched video reply come in with man answer the reply be harrowing and insightful nobody man no one care not single soul nobody no one cause be all alone think speak for lot of people when say do call anyone nobody guy no one give speak for the guy literally no one you all call someone there no one nobody who care no one man no one care not single person would turn to single person on this earth as they will use it against would call anyone what we can call somebody that small insight from seemingly jokey platform hit on what we the house and wide society must look at to try to understand why man feel they be not value why do they feel they can not call someone why do they fear do so will be use against they why do they fear ask for help many hide in plain sight struggle and battle until it be too late after all we know from the samaritans that about two third of suicide victim be not know to mental health service hon member may wonder why be choose to focus my comment on man when the late datum from the office for national statistics show that suicide rate be at their high level since as we have hear man account for three quarter of all suicide in the uk the late paper by the centre for policy research on men and boys put that in stark light it show that more man under die in the uk due to suicide than for any other reason man every day die by suicide in the uk of all suicide be male three time as many man die by suicide every year than die in vehicle accident and by over man in england and wales have die by suicide this century that be enough to fill wembley stadium there be so much to do in this area want to highlight the focus and progress of the previous government through the nhs long term plan an additional million be provide by the former conservative government between and to fund suicide prevention and bereavement service in every local authority my former colleague sajid javid who be touch tragically by the experience of lose his own brother to suicide be instrumental in start the development of the suicide prevention strategy which be publish in key initiative include the development of new nationwide near real time suspect suicide surveillance system that aim to provide early detection and timely action to address change in suicide rate the strategy in its entirety set out over action to make progress across government departments the nhs the voluntary sector and national partner in the previous government also announce million of funding for crisis mental health facility and patient safety in mental health unit in january it be announce that million of funding would be allocate to new mental health ambulance with million go towards new project include scheme provide alternative to that be welcome but the stat show that even with all that focus the trend be worsen despite all that work and prioritisation of funding we have yet to hear anything substantial from this government about what they be do on suicide prevention as we know from one example training can make difference samaritan report from its rail team that for every one life lose it be estimate that six life be save by intervention make thank to the training give to national rail and rail operating staff that be proof that thing can be do just yesterday it be world suicide prevention day and the prime minister be ask twice about the topic in response he say first may also thank those deal with suicide prevention probably everybody in this house know someone who have take their life it touch all of we and we must do everything we can together to prevent suicide official report september vol secondly he say think that suicide prevention matter to everybody in this house will reaffirm our commitment and will work across the house with all member to deal with suicide prevention official report september vol those be positive warm word from the prime minister which we be all pleased to hear however think that we across this house and among the public would be interested in hear the tangible action take by this government after one year in office will the minister provide an update on what direct practical step this government be take on suicide prevention include the implementation of the recommendation in the strategy what point for example disparity in the difference across ethnicity and race in the uk be be address know that the government have be consult on wide range of issue particularly when it come to man health and the man health strategy have be shin light on those issue since be elect in so thank the government for take that important step forward understand that the government be due to publish the mental health strategy and commend they for that indeed note than in an adjournment debate early this year the minister for care state in november my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care bring together lead campaigner expert and the premier league to gather idea and inform our strategy and our year health plan we take suicide prevention extremely seriously because every suicide be tragedy that have devastating and enduring impact on family friend and community official report march vol his majesty opposition welcome that step forward but in look at the year plan note that suicide be mention only three time think that everyone here hop to see it feature heavily in the upcoming man health strategy will the minister provide an update on timescale for the strategy and how it will consider suicide prevention will the government look at the prospect of minister for man and boy if the evidence point in that direction we have minister for women as we believe that woman have different problem across society by that very logic man and boy have different need too if we be to go down the route of segregate policy on sex there appear to be compelling argument to have man minister to work across department that can not be starker if we consider that for every woman who die by suicide in the uk three man die another achievement by the previous government be the launch of the suicide prevention grant fund as we have hear provide million to organisation between august and march in my constituency the charity first step leicester leicestershire and rutland receive and the grant be use to improve specialist counselling work in prison and to build on pilot project it be therefore regret that the suicide prevention grant come to an end in march and have yet to be renew or replace in response to write question in april the minister for care state there be currently no plan to run another grant fund will the minister explain the basis behind the decision early this year not to renew or replace the suicide prevention grant fund and what alternative provision if any be be provide thank the shadow minister for his comment there be no question but that we all want to work together to achieve the good outcome may remind he however that the million voluntary service grant be one off grant and that the last government fail to renew the funding the million that be mention for local authority prevention work thank the hon lady for all the work she do with the appg be look holistically at the different part of what we be try to do in this space have already outline all the funding that the previous government put in and will come on to some of the other problem such as the national insurance rise because she will know that they will have devastating impact at the time the minister also state we will be evaluate the impact of the fund and the service that have be provide by the grant fund organisation learn from this evaluation will help to inform the government mission to reduce the life lose to suicide could the minister provide further detail about that evaluation such as when it will be complete and whether the government would reconsider their decision to end the grant funding if the result show that it have have positive impact in support suicide prevention charity be not exempt from the increase in employer national insurance contribution in the budget that have significantly hamper their financial situation we just have to listen to what the samaritans say in response to the spending review last year the reality be that funding for suicide prevention have dwindle down to next to nothing to deliver our life save work charity be reliant on donation on the generosity of the public and this be even more precarious at time when many people across the country be face economic hardship point that out not to score political point but to draw attention to the fact that the labour government need to set direction and plan to deal with the lead killer of man and woman under the age of in closing want to recognise that yesterday be world suicide prevention day every year people across the world take their own life the theme this year be change the narrative on suicide it call on we all to challenge harmful myth reduce stigma and foster open compassionate conversation about suicide that lead to where start if man do not know their value if they do not know they have someone to confide in and if they do not truly believe that we care we will not break the cycle we will not make difference and ultimately we will not save life that be the challenge lay before society this house and ultimately this government believe we have new minister dr zubir ahmed congratulation on the promotion and welcome to the dispatch box just in case you need to know we have be touch by young male suicide in my constituency of sussex weald so will be listen closely to your response it be an honour to respond on behalf of my hon friend the mental health minister and the government on this uniquely emotive topic that impact every community thank my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher for give we the opportunity to have this debate the day after world suicide prevention day know that the whole house will join in thank he for channel deep amount of personal pain and sorrow into such constructive debate his family and constituent should be rightly proud also want to commend all hon friend and hon member for their contribution many of which have also come from position of personal pain and experience often in our society it be the doctor and nurse who be perceive to be the lifesaver but be confident that every hon member who have take part in the debate be lifesaver and their constituent should be rightly proud of all of they the hon member for winchester dr chambers speak about the mental health fund and would be delighted to set up meeting with he and my colleague the mental health minister to talk far about that my hon friend the member for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier ask for meeting with his constituent helena parent and would also be delighted to arrange that the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans in his usual forensic manner ask number of question that hope will address in my speech but be sure he will be forthcoming if there be any shortcoming in my answer the government stand on manifesto commitment to tackle the big killer and suicide remain the lead cause of death for young people in this country every life lose to suicide be one too many that be why our man health strategy our plan for change and our year health plan have give renew focus on prevention our aim be to get the nhs government departments academia and the private sector to intertwine like never before in call to action let briefly set out the different strand of the work first we will target high risk group include child and young people middle aged man and people know to have history of self harm secondly we will expand the offer of our mental health emergency department as part of our year plan thirdly we will imbibe great sense of responsibility and responsiveness in the digital and media sector too often people in crisis find themselves terrified and vulnerable in place that be least equipped to help they for example traditional department face long wait and often inadequate support that be why we be commit to expand mental health emergency department we be invest up to million to bring the number of mental health emergency department up to while pilot an innovative model of mental health care for people with serious mental health need that will mean that people in their dark moment can access immediate specialist care in safe and dignified space give that only one third of people who die by suicide be in contact with mental health service we be also work to make support easy to find and easy to navigate our shift from hospital to neighbourhood care in the year plan be big part of that as be nhs england recently publish stay safe from suicide guidance which be for all mental health practitioner to follow it remove any uncertainty about the approach that they should take move they away from tick box checklist and put each patient and their individual circumstance at the centre of their care today can update the house that nhs england be launch an learn module as practical resource to support the implementation of the guidance the whole country be horrify by the excellent portrayal of the issue currently affect young man in the television show adolescence it be work of fiction but it shine searing light on many of the struggle that young people face include social isolation ironically in an age of social medium and connectivity that be why this government be take action by equip generation of young people with the tool to manage their mental health by the end of this parliament every school in england will have access to mental health support team but as we safeguard our child in school we can not remain blind to the poisonous environment that child be expose to online as father know that this be something that keep every parent up at night that be why we be promote online safety and ensure responsible medium representation of issue relate to suicide and self harm under the government online safety act all in scope service be now require to protect their user from illegal content include illegal suicide and self harm content beyond that the strong protection in the act be for child who be now also protect from legal but harmful suicide and self harm content we have see too many tragic story of child be bombard with that content often with fatal consequence the onus be now on tech firm to recognise that that material have no place on their platform or in our society ofcom be continue to implement this regime and it have recently publish proposal regard additional step that should be take to ensure that such content be not promote in an algorithmic fashion but we know that legislation be not enough will now turn to the point make by my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme about first responder training first responder play an important part in prevent suicide as they be often the first port of call for someone in distress and experience suicidal ideation we will work closely with first responder include the police and ambulance staff to support suicide prevention effort sometimes the first response to someone experience distress be provide by government frontline service that be why the suicide prevention strategy include the training of frontline staff in some departments the ministry of justice be roll out mandatory suicide awareness training to prison staff and department for work and pensions frontline staff be receive mandatory training the nhs be commit to ensure that all healthcare professional receive the necessary mental health training to meet the need of patient will now turn to the question of neighbourhood mental health service the international evidence base be robust and we be currently test the extent of the benefit of the model here there will be an external evaluation of these pilot to determine their impact particularly in term of patient experience access reduction in pressure on exist service and economic impact we will follow the evidence and make an assessment for future roll out will now turn to the research into gender difference in suicide we agree that research be hugely beneficial for make good quality policy that be why the ambition outline in the suicide prevention strategy for england cover five year and include research on national trend and suicide rate in specific group we will continue to look for way to improve our national real time suspect suicide surveillance system so that we can pick up on these trend and act on they fast we will draw on expert from our advisory group and listen to people with live experience to help we understand why we see some of these pattern and what can be do to address they want to end by thank my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme for bring forward this debate also thank all other colleague

closure of the no limits community café and hub in newton abbot devon that gather additional signature the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to protect exist community support hub and ensure long term resource allocation and recognition of their role in mental health wellbee and inclusion and the petitioner remain etc male chick culling motion make and question propose that this house do now hughes declare an interest early this week host the ban hatch and dispatch event in parliament with the vegetarian society as well as host drop in event the previous week it be important to hear presentation from industry expert about the innovative and effective in ovo testing laboratory in europe which offer vision of what we could have here in the uk will be host further event on november and encourage colleague to attend be keenly await the publication of the animal welfare strategy this autumn and hope that this topic will be discuss in it thank my hon friend for bring this animal cruelty to the attention of the house consider the advance that have be make in determine the sex of chick before they hatch do she agree that there be absolutely no excuse for commercial egg producer to be routinely cull animal on such massive scale could not agree more motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now hughes agree what my hon friend the member for glasgow north east maureen burke say and will go on to say more about that most people will not have hear of hatch and dispatch which be process of cull male chick few hour after they be bear because they be not capable of lay egg and do not grow fat enough to breed for meat it be estimate that billion newly hatch male chick be cull globally every year around million of which be in the uk legally live chick can be kill use maceration exposure to insert gas or cervical dislocation where no other method be available in the century surely it be not acceptable that such cruel practice take place when alternative exist as will go on to describe in july the then government animal welfare committee release report opinion on chick cull alternative which call to ban male chick culling and import from system that still use cull the committee advise that any future welfare labelling scheme should say whether the production system cull male chick or use in ovo technology as well as call for financial support for the introduction of new technology and for wildlife rehabilitation project which be reliant on cull chick for food in ovo technology can determine the sex of chick while it be in the egg mean that only female egg will hatch and avoid the cruel cull research have show that chick embryo can feel pain from around day of egg incubation so most in ovo sex system operate between day eight and of incubation while some method take small fluid sample there be also non invasive technique such as spectroscopy and hormone detection there be also significant progress in many other country male chick culling be ban in germany france and austria while country such as italy have pass ban that will take effect in the future and many other country include the united states and the netherlands among other have adopt in ovo technology voluntarily or through retail lead initiative hope people here will agree that it be time that the uk catch up and introduce ban on this cruel practice almost of egg consume in the uk be produce in the uk that be figure of about billion egg per year out of the billion that be consume in total so about billion egg year be import thank the hon member for give way she be passionate about animal welfare she mention in ovo technology identify the sex of chick similar technology have work well in the dairy industry where semen can be sex before cow be artificially inseminate to ensure we have female cow rather than surplus of male cow that end up get cull at young age that be successful programme in the dairy industry that could be replicate in the poultry industry fully agree with what the hon member say and think that be good example to follow two major hatchery dominate the uk lay hen sector if we be able to introduce in ovo sex technology in just two hatchery we would be able to eradicate the vast majority of male chick cull in the uk commercial egg industry so surely that be worth consider the public be vastly in favour of that as well poll by the vegetarian society in may find that of respondent support ban male chick cull even if it would result in price increase of per egg in westminster over mp and peer from different party sign joint letter to the former minister call for ban on male chick culling what would happen to egg that be deem to be male the immediate answer would be to merge they with other hatchery biproduct use for energy generation fertiliser or animal feed however expert be also investigate the possibility that the egg could be use to feed exotic animal in captivity they could potentially be high value product as by day the chick embryo have nail beak and bone as well as not be sentient yet on personal note as vegan for many year find this whole discussion difficult but it be important to highlight that currently cull chick be be use as animal feed for captive raptor however animal by product from slaughterhouse could be the good alternative as this would be circular and low impact approach that would ultimately reduce the number of animal kill expert recommend that this should be short term solution with long term research focus on cultivate meat cultivate casting and even print whole prey alternative the culling of live male chick be cruel and outdated practice there be strong public support on this issue and wide international precedent as with many other keenly await the animal welfare strategy this autumn and hope that the banning of the culling of male chick will be key aim of the strategy it be important that road map with timeline be introduce to phase out this cruel practice and that male chick culling and import be thing of the past thank my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell for secure this debate she raise this issue in westminster hall debate on animal welfare standard in farming in june and be grateful to she for give we the opportunity to focus on the subject in more detail today fully recognise that there be strong public feeling on the routine culling of male chick as highlight by the breadth of support that the vegetarian society ban hatch dispatch campaign have attract my hon friend have speak passionately on the subject this evening as nation we be rightly proud of the high animal welfare standard that underpin our high quality british produce this government want to build on and maintain our world lead record on animal health and welfare and we be absolutely committed to ensure that animal receive the care respect and protection that they deserve completely understand that the culling of day old chick be process that many include someone not far away from this dispatch box may find incomprehensible and wasteful assure my hon friend that all farm animal be protect by comprehensive and robust animal health and welfare legislation include when they be kill regulation set out strict requirement to protect the welfare of animal at the time of killing which include male chick in the egg production sector as she point out the permit kill method for chick such as gas stunning be base on scientific research and assessment to ensure that the bird be spar any avoidable pain distress or suffering all lay hen hatchery in the uk use argon gas mixture as their stunning method that be much more humane method than other gas such as carbon dioxide which be routinely use in several european country and elsewhere in the world however as have be comment by the animal welfare committee an expert committee advise the uk scottish and welsh governments on animal welfare issue the routine killing of chick be principally an ethical issue rather than welfare problem because it do not lead to direct welfare harm of course that do not mean that we should not work to see if we can move away from it in the future as quickly as be practical and possible be able to do that rely on viable alternative be develop my hon friend talk about some of those in her remark the animal welfare committee review the alternative to cull newly hatch chick and publish its independent opinion on this issue last year in its report the committee recommend that chick culling should be ban as soon as reliable accurate technology be available it also highlight that several consequence would arise from such ban and as such it would be crucial to learn from those country that have already commit to move away from the culling of male chick my hon friend mention that germany france and other european state have ban the culling of male chick but some european state have encounter issue follow ban in some case in country where there be ban in place germany for example male chick be merely transport to other member state prior to be kill which be not the welfare gain one would want to get from such ban any ban on the culling of male chick need to allow for the rearing and processing of those male bird that hatch despite the use of in ovo sex technology another issue flag in the animal welfare committee report be the fact that male chick provide whole food source for exotic animal and raptor congratulate my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell on secure the debate and outline so eloquently the case for this cause which support give that we use many male chick carcase for animal feed pet food and place like bird of prey centre and we import far more than we use do the minister agree that we need to find solution to meet that need if we be as hope to eventually move to in ovo sex in hatchery agree that when supply chain however difficult be establish and we try to move away from it there can be unintended consequence we have to look at the whole series of issue along that chain so that we do not end up in situation that have low welfare outcome than the one we start with assure my hon friend that the department be well aware of that and we will not move in any way if we would end up in bad welfare situation than the one we start with but he make perfectly good point as be about to say another issue flag in the animal welfare committee report be the fact that male chick provide whole food source for exotic animal and we would have to replace that in recent year there have be phenomenal global progress in the development of technology that could help to end routine culling of male chick by identify or determine embryo sex before hatch and it appear that this be go on in the dairy industry as well there be clearly lot of scientific work go on to see what we can do to get away from the current situation in our livestock supply chain several new method and system have appear and many refinement in exist system have continue since the publication of the animal welfare committee report on this subject we welcome the uk egg industry interest in the development of day zero sex technology which enable egg to be sex prior to the start of their incubation such commercial system offer many benefit include economic and sustainability saving by directly free up hatchery space in addition to provide an ethical solution to the culling of chick in germany one alternative be the rearing of male layer chick for meat production also know as brother hen due to their slow growth rate rear brother hen require great input of feed and long rear phase to produce small bird with less desirable body composition make it more challenging to rear they commercially at scale in the uk there be lack of publish research on the welfare of brother hen but animal welfare concern have be link to this practice in particular manage aggression and high mortality within all male flock can be problematic often accentuate by housing inappropriate to the bird behavioural need aside from in ovo sex technology and rearing of brother hen be pleased to hear about an initiative to assess the viability of dual purpose poultry breed in the uk that is breed that can be use for lay and meat clearly they be not as specialist as the different breed currently use for the laying of egg and for meat but since they be dual purpose they do not result in the mass culling of male in the lay industry the initiative be award funding early this year as part of defra farming innovation programme use bird that can serve both as egg layer and meat producer could offer an alternative to chick culling but it be different meat they grow and turn out differently than uk consumer be perhaps use to it be also think that dual breed bring other animal welfare benefit as hen of dual purpose breed have low incidence of keel bone fracture and some breed show less injurious peck behaviour than find in commercial lay hen breed the male of dual breed have well walking ability low level of pododermatitis and well feather cover than fast grow meat chicken breed in addition to the animal health and welfare benefit the project be also look at the sustainability benefit of dual breed dual breed have low protein requirement and german trial find that locally grow bean be suitable alternative to very protein soya if this approach to chicken breeding can be make viable become popular and be accept by uk consumer those three thing all have to work it may deliver sustainability benefit bring value to male layer chick be of key importance and look forward to hear the outcome of this research and whether dual purpose breed might offer more ethical and sustainable approach than our current one this government be elect on mandate to introduce the most ambitious plan in generation to improve animal welfare and that be exactly what we be go to do our farm animal welfare policy be back by robust evidence base and be support and shape by input from our many excellent stakeholder and expert advice group look forward to speak to hon member about this in more detail soon although as say early this be principally an ethical rather than animal welfare issue that do not mean that we should not be try very robustly to address it look forward to see progress in this area over the next period that be incredibly educational question put and agree to house adjourn
