it be delight to welcome you to your new position madam deputy speaker which be sure you will fill with great aplomb as you have do other position that have see you in over the past few year in this house congratulate the hon member for lowestoft jess asato on her maiden speech it be very interesting to hear about her background in the charity sector her tribute to former member who be inspiration to she and who have pass away be very moving know in what high regard tessa jowell be hold particularly by those on the labour benches it be also very nice to hear her tribute to peter aldous he be calm and quiet man in some way but he be also very kind man who really do stand up for his constituent on many of the important issue that she mention he will be miss by those on the conservative benches one of the first thing that do when be new member be try to speak to constituency neighbour from other party those conversation can be incredibly helpful and revealing and can ensure that you work together on local issue that should really transcend party line speak just yesterday with the hon member for north durham luke akehurst who have take an area of my former constituency hope the hon lady do that and take advantage of the all party parliamentary group one of my good baptism be with the hon member for neath and swansea east carolyn harris who be superb on the appg for gambling relate harm we work together cross party with mps from northern ireland the liberal democrats and the snp so urge the hon member for lowestoft to delve into the appgs she give fantastic maiden speech thank you very much for call to speak madam deputy speaker want to touch on couple of point that have be raise already and then touch on few local issue for my constituent as well as make slight mention of couple of national issue the previous government record be clear we start with of our electricity come from renewable source and end with that be good move for the long term interest of the country however as the committee on climate change say and as mention in an intervention there will still be need for oil and gas in the long term in our country there be manufacture base for deliver that which often work symbiotically with our manufacture base for new offshore wind really hope that the government think about and recognise that when it come to our energy security do not want our country at the mercy of foreign power urge they to really think about the impact that not press ahead with new oil and gas in the north sea be have on constituency particularly in the energy heart of our country around aberdeenshire in scotland we will require it so think that be mistake sort of understand politically why they might have go for that but really urge they to think again in the national interest since there have be over billion of investment in our energy sector from the private sector whatever we do it will be private sector lead the relatively small investment figure that the government have be talk about have be reflect on just urge they to ensure that whatever happen be private sector lead and deliver the really good long term job and growth for the country that we have be talk about and have secure over the last few year want to pick up on few thing that the government have say my right hon friend the member for east surrey claire coutinho mention the year but the minister do not cover that could he provide clarity on that issue it be something that constituent up and down the country will think about the minister talk about community own energy company similar to great british energy there have be experience of that there be robin hood energy in nottingham which end up cost taxpayer huge amount of money in the long term be interested to know whether the government be invest in the bit that the private sector will not invest in how can they guarantee the return that the minister be talk about and how can they guarantee that the policy will not cost taxpayer more in the future as former member of the public accounts committee do not want to see when look into this in few year time that taxpayer be leave on the hook when the private sector would not step in on the overall cost of the net zero plan in the run up to the general election the labour party drop its commitment to spend billion year on move towards the target really could do with clarity from the government on the figure that they be look at give that in the month precede the general election shadow ministers talk about it potentially cost hundred of billion of pound to get to that target as mention in an intervention on the liberal democrat front bencher the hon member for bath wera hobhouse on energy infrastructure the impact would be on community such as billericay bearsted and laindon in my constituency where there would be foot pylon right down the centre of an area of unspoilt countryside really would ask the government to reflect on that particularly as germany be move to an underground first approach if the germans can do it do not see why we can not it be in the conservative manifesto
