great deal it be the last labour government response to the make poverty history campaign that show that politic at its good can be an unparalleled force for good and that significant change can happen when people power meet political power that be when first find the labour party get into politic like many to make difference but be drive every day by the simple belief that someone background should not determine their life chance and life choice that be why it feel fitting to give this speech today in debate that be fundamentally about how we make our parliament well and fair while be great supporter of british institution and tradition there be clearly no place in modern parliament for people largely man who can vote on legislation as birthright because their father do as new officer of the all party parliamentary group on financial education for young people and as soon to be member of the upcoming group focus on political and media literacy will work hard and across the divide to help other to feel as confident capable and comfortable as anyone else in these space hope to show that if can stand here today girl from village who have and still have simple belief in
