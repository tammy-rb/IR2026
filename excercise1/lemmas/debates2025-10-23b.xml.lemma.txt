youth experience scheme with the european union it will of course be cap but it will give significant opportunity not just for young brits to travel work and study abroad but to welcome young europeans here at my meet and greet session last week my constituent mick also raise that point about the importance of our young people have more opportunity to work and study abroad include in europe be so pleased by the government announcement of youth mobility scheme with the eu but could ask the minister for an update on those plan and how they will benefit my constituent in aylesbury

the eu my hon friend be powerful advocate for her constituent and the common understanding will of course benefit the business she mention our deal on emission energy trading food and agricultural

mull of kintyre in the family have gather compelling evidence suggest that the ministry of defence be aware that the mk chinook in which they be travel be not airworthy they be petition the government

efficiency gain across the public and private sector such as when someone change their name after marriage or buy property how do the minister see modernisation of the state improve the delivery of

digital id that will bring the state to all citizen and improve access to public service national digital identity system be public good that be long overdue and this government will deliver it the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster have just come to the dispatch box and say that we have do new trade deal with the european union which think be news to both the prime minister and brussels the only thing this government have do so far in term of eu relation be to sell out our fishing industry for the next year with that in mind will the minister actually stand up for british interest in future negotiation with brussels stand up for british interest in every negotiation with brussels will tell the hon gentleman what be not stand up for british interest we negotiate within month of come into government the new common understanding that will be good for job bear down on bill and give we the tool to secure our border the leader of the conservative party oppose it before even read it have be think about the cost of software licensing in the public sector because north west anglia nhs foundation trust be try to move to an electronic patient record and one of the big ongoing cost of that be third party payment for software other trust be in the same position as be many school pay for pupil management software will the procurement minister commit to look into whether we can instead deliver some of that in house and save significant sum case of the kind my hon friend be talk about be the reason we have be consult on public interest test on the specific case he raise if he write to will ensure that the parliamentary secretary cabinet office my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven chris ward provide he with response my constituent phil be in the special category mechanism for the people who be inexplicably exclude from the infected blood compensation scheme in february even though the government expert group say in august last year that they should be compensate on june the paymaster general say he would consider the compensation arrangement may have miss it forgive if have but also ask for list of condition that might be include within that do he have an update for please be certainly look at the issue of the special category mechanism as undertake to do if the hon lady write to can look at the specific list but be also hop with mr speaker permission to update the house on this and other infected blood issue very shortly resident in housing development in my constituency be face number of issue after yet another developer have go bust part of the share communal land have revert back to the ownership of the duchy of cornwall rather than to the resident themselves who have to purchase the land back and cover the duchy legal cost the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster quite rightly have cabinet oversight but who do the duchy of cornwall answer to and what recourse do my constituent now have in this case if the hon member write to with his constituency case will make sure that the duchy of cornwall look at it in due course eastbourne be benefit from some coastal defence scheme funding the flood defence grant in aid but it leave heritage asset behind only resident and business currently qualify which be leave eastbourne historic bandstand at risk of severe flooding will the minister meet and colleague across the department for culture media and sport and the department for environment food and rural affairs to review the loophole that leave our bandstand behind recognise the problem the decision be to use the budget available to protect people home and that have leave other building at comparable risk the relevant defra minister be work with dcms on this issue will ensure that conversation can take place on the infected blood compensation scheme in northern ireland as of february people have start the process with offer make total some million what assessment have be make of the time take from when an application be make to when payment actually arrive through the door the infected blood compensation authority be operationally independent but be accountable to this house it be important that have regular conversation and provide challenge on the kind of timescale the hon gentleman be talk about the infected blood scandal predate modern day devolution and he can rest assure that all four corner of the united kingdom be at the forefront of my mind in respect of the speed of delivery the minister be early ask about the ever grow size of the civil service and the cabinet office under this government and whether we would see those number come down not go up next year instead of answer the question about the future they talk about the past let ask the question again but from different angle when be this government go to take ownership of the fact that they be in government now and these be their problem that they need to resolve be very happy to take ownership of the fact that we be in government and very happy to confirm that the conservatives be in opposition allege spying case role of attorney general office urgent question to ask the solicitor general if she will make statement about the role of the attorney general office in the decision to drop the china spy prosecution thank the right hon gentleman for raise this urgent question follow the deeply disappointing collapse of the prosecution case concern two individual charge under the official secrets act it be bedrock constitutional principle that prosecution in this country be free from political influence this mean that it be prosecutor not politician who decide which case to prosecute it be prosecutor not politician who decide what evidence will be use at criminal trial and it be prosecutor not politician who decide when case should be drop although individual decision be make independently and protect from political influence the crown prosecution service as an organisation be superintend by the attorney general by virtue of the prosecution of offences act the detail of what that mean in practice be set out in the framework agreement between the law officers and the director of public prosecutions sign by the then attorney general under the previous government the framework make it plain that the role of the cps be to take independent decision on individual case refer to it by the police and other criminal investigation authority base on the evidence available and the public interest in pursue prosecution which accord with the code for crown prosecutor there be limited number of offence include those under the official secrets act for which parliament have make statutory provision require the attorney general consent to prosecute in individual case in do so the law officer act in quasi judicial capacity independently of government and apply the same stage test as the code consent be give by my predecessor on april follow that date no law officer intervene in the case at any stage it would have be wholly inappropriate for they to do so once consent be give the law officer play no ongoing role if the prosecutor contemplate drop the case because of evidential reason they be require to inform the attorney general of the decision as soon as it have be take that be what happen in this case the dpp and senior treasury counsel have already confirm that the decision to offer no evidence in this case be make without any political influence and the cabinet secretary director of public prosecutions attorney general and chief secretary to the prime minister will all give write and oral evidence to the joint committee on the national security strategy this and next week the ongoing disinformation around the collapse of this case be now distract from the most important issue that we should all be focus on which be how the government can work across party and with the uk law enforcement community to ensure that chinese espionage and interference be not successful in the uk let cut to the chase it be standard practice for the cps to inform the attorney general if case of political significance that have require attorney general consent in the first place be likely to be drop we be tell that the attorney general be inform that this case be at risk but have not formally be end in august be this correct can the solicitor general provide the exact date of that meeting it would have be the attorney general duty to ask why the case be at risk that do not mean seek to change the independent judgment of the cps on whether to proceed but it could and should have mean ask and ensure that more evidence be provide to the cps at its request it be abundantly clear that the cps be ask for further evidence on the question of whether china pose current threat to national security so the attorney general and the government have decision to make whether to provide the evidence or not even if they think that it be excessive to do so the attorney general must have understand what be require we be tell that he be an eminent lawyer so what do he do the moment he know who do he inform within government and when do he inform the prime minister or his office do he take any step to ensure that the evidence be provide we know that on september the director general of the ag office attend meeting at which the case be discuss at that point the case could still have be salvage at that meeting do the attorney general office push for further evidence to be provide follow that meeting the sunday times have report that the attorney general office be ask to speak to the cps can the sg confirm whether anyone from the ago speak directly or indirectly to the cps the ag know that the case be go to collapse in august he know what be require to save it but unless the solicitor general can provide compelling account today we must all conclude that the ag on behalf of the government choose not to provide it he may not have kill the case but he allow it to die there be example in the recent past of ag have the candour to come to the house and explain that the government and the prosecute authority have choose to drop case that raise the high national security question for diplomatic reason will the sg today have the candour to do exactly the same with this case today we have hear from the shadow justice secretary yet more of the baseless smear that have characterise the conservative party approach to matter of such importance to this house and the whole nation he know that the attorney general will give evidence next week as soon as tuesday to the joint committee on the national security strategy like the shadow justice secretary train and practise in law so he should know the importance of consistency when put case together yet his word today have bring only more confusion to the conservatives chaotic approach first they accuse the government of political interference in this case without evidence when that be disproven they argue that we do not interfere but should have interfere in an independent prosecution so which be it their approach have serve only to distract from their own failing and frankly do disservice to the history and heritage of their party respectfully remind the house that part of the reason we find ourselves in this situation be because the conservatives spend their year in government fight among themselves and not fix glare hole in our national security law the charge in this case be bring under the official secrets act you be suppose to be law officer answer the question order mr jenrick when you get uq you get your time and want you to be hear in silence quite rightly because this be an important issue that affect this house but do not need barrack from the opposition benches want you to help if you wish to catch my eye in the future this be not the good way to do so the charge in this case be bring under the official secrets act outdated legislation draw up even before the dawn of world war one as say the attorney general the chief secretary to the prime minister the deputy national security adviser the cabinet secretary and the director of public prosecutions will all appear before the joint committee on the national security strategy next week and the government have commit to fully engage with committees across both houses as this issue be rightly scrutinise along with proper parliamentary scrutiny another core tenet of our democracy be prosecution service free of political interference that be something that we on this side of the house will always defend give that the conservatives during their year of chaotic power seek to develop an even close relationship with china can urge the government to continue labour approach which be to look at opportunity to work together while not compromise our value and national interest at any time agree with my hon friend position remind the house that the test in this case apply to how china be view under the previous government not this one call the liberal democrat spokesperson throughout these revelation ministers and the prime minister spokesperson have repeatedly claim that the government have no sight of the witness statement and no input the pm himself say that at prime minister question last week but the government legal service own guidance require the attorney general to be consult on the most sensitive legal case involve the government in case as high profile as this where the very integrity of parliament and our national security be at stake do the attorney general the government top legal adviser really not review the witness statement before they be submit on behalf of the government if not please could the solicitor general tell we why not give the very serious national security implication will the sg commit to statutory independent inquiry into why the case collapse and will she please update the house as to when the government will share the full china audit with the intelligence and security committee as set out in my answer to the urgent question the previous law officer give consent to prosecute in april after that happen it be right that there be no further involvement of law officer in case in accordance with the framework that be how thing work it be right that politician do not interfere with prosecution in criminal case and that be what happen in this case once consent to prosecute be grant may just start by say that nobody in this house be dispute the independence of the prosecution or indeed the judicial officer nobody have have any dispute on that point at all the question be different one it be whether an official who be give evidence not on his behalf but on behalf of the government should have have any communication with his own government after the prosecutor say that the evidence be not sufficient one argument be that if the government be not supply enough evidence surely they should supply little bit more but the argument that the government be use be that the official give evidence on the basis of the previous government view between and well that be little odd because the labour party manifesto be not write until and yet he quote it in his evidence there be an incoherence here either he be give evidence on the basis of the previous government view between and in which case the labour party manifesto be irrelevant or he be reflect the view of the government post in which case the quotation of the labour party manifesto be relevant which be it in term of the witness statement to start with the first and by far most substantive witness statement be the one make under the previous government in relation to more recent statement the conservatives starting argument be that the government in some way interfere with the evidence and now they seem to be criticise the fact that we do not interfere with the evidence it be right that the deputy national security adviser give that evidence free from any political interference as have be confirm numerous time in this house already my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick be quite right throughout the whole saga as my right hon friend the member for tonbridge tom tugendhat make clear there have be conflict story about who do what and why it could or could not be do all in the same breath but we know the rule require that the attorney general be consult on matter that be politically sensitive it do not cut across his independence it simply mean that he or she have to be inform at the time we understand from the director of public prosecutions that the attorney general must have be tell that there be insufficient evidence to prosecute if so the attorney general role in this matter independently be to say to the authority in the government you be not provide sufficient evidence this prosecution will collapse unless you do do the attorney general say to the government you be not provide enough evidence to secure prosecution it be over to you to do as you have be ask by the dpp the attorney general will be give his evidence to the committee next week think it be right to say that the case be drop by the cps not on public interest ground but on evidential ground when case be drop on evidential ground the framework set out that the law officer be inform when that have happen and not that there be consultation beforehand this be case that do not continue on evidential ground give the important national security implication of this whole sorry case what assessment have the attorney general office make of the impact that the decision may have on confidence in our ability to prosecute alleged foreign interference this case be prosecute under legislation that be in force when the alleged offence be commit in to the law have now change it take the conservative party many year to tighten up national security legislation it pass with support from labour members and under the legislation as it stand now it be easy to bring prosecution of this nature because the enemy test no long have to be satisfied the attorney general have duty to superintend prosecution agency the government have previously define superintendence as inter alia right for the attorney general to be consult and inform about difficult sensitive and high profile case of which this be clearly one give that the attorney general be responsible by statute for the superintendence of the crown prosecution service and overall intendency of the dpp and additionally have the requirement for consent to prosecute certain category of criminal offence such as those relate to official secret what action do the attorney general take once he have be inform of the potential collapse of the china spy trial as have set out consent to prosecute in this case have to be grant by law officers and that be do under the previous government once consent be grant it be for the cps to prosecute case rightly without political interference this case be discontinue by the cps on evidential ground as oppose to public interest ground be sure that the hon member be aware of the two part test for prosecutor when case be discontinue on evidential ground it be not for the cps to consult with law officer in advance of that say again that the attorney general will first give write evidence this week and then oral evidence on tuesday none of it make sense not the collapse trial chagos or the embassy but as my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis say it all make sense if the government have prioritise strategic relationship with communist china do it not politely remind the right hon gentleman that this case be to be try under the government position in relation to china between and when his party be in government the solicitor general have repeatedly say that prosecutor and not politician should decide whether to prosecute of course that be the case but that be straw man argument the issue here be not political interference in the decision to prosecute but political interference in the evidence that be give to the cps affect its ability to prosecute we have be tell that the attorney general be inform why be he inform if not to allow he to take action to perfect the evidence why do he not the prime minister and the dpp have both confirm that there be no political interference in the evidence give by the deputy national security adviser and rightly so the conservative party can not have it both way first the argument be that we interfere with the evidence and now it seem to be that we do not which be it the sunday times report that follow key meeting on september the attorney general office be ask to speak to the cps do anyone from the attorney general office speak directly or indirectly to the cps after that meeting there be meeting on september in relation to this matter which as understand it take place on the basis that the prosecution would go ahead it be to discuss bilateral relation with china in the context of the ongoing legal case the director of public prosecutions have say that the case be drop because effort over many month to get evidence that china represent threat to national security be not forthcoming from this government when be the attorney general inform that the case be at risk and what do he do in order for this case to succeed it be base on the relationship with china at the time of the offence and how china be view then have already refer to the meeting on september which be on the presumption that the case would continue the attorney general will set out his evidence to the joint committee on the national security strategy next week previously ask the security minister about the lack of inclusion of china on the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme what input or advice have the attorney general or the solicitor general give to the government on that give the ongoing situation will she now reconsider and push for the government to do that under the law as it now stand it would be easy to bring prosecution in case such as these we be deeply disappointed that this prosecution do not go ahead but will get back to he on the specific point that he raise the solicitor general have express several time she and presumably the government disappointment at the fact that this do not go to trial that disappointment would suggest that she and the government wish for an alternative outcome the simple point that and my constituent can not get our head around they have contact about this because they be outraged and concerned be that if the government wish for an alternative outcome why do they not exhaust every single possibility to bolster the case of the cps regardless of interference and there be no question of political interference why do they not exhaust every single opportunity to put the cps in the strong possible position to ensure successful prosecution the government be disappoint that this prosecution do not go ahead if the previous conservative government have tighten our law in relation to national security before we may not have find ourselves in this position it be absolutely right that there be no political interference with the witness evidence it be an important part of our constitution that criminal prosecution be do without political interference when be the attorney general inform that the case be go to collapse the attorney general will be set out his evidence to the joint committee next tuesday to be perfectly honest do not know what the point be in ask this question because we have have two week of statement and urgent question and ministers keep attack straw man and answer question that be not actually be ask it be pathetic on monday the security minister come to the house and be ask several time when the home secretary know that the case be go to collapse and what representation she make to ensure that the case be as strong as possible he do not answer that several time when do the home secretary know what representation do she make and to whom do she make they surely among they be the national security adviser the prime minister and the attorney general do not speak on behalf of the home secretary but be sure that she will be happy to address the hon member point welcome the solicitor general to her new role and wish she every success and happiness in it hopefully it will not be as hard the next time round as the chinese spy prosecution case roll on and on concern on the ground be grow about the state of national security and our intelligence community do she accept the lack of confidence that have arise from the handling of this case what can be do to assure british citizen that their interest and security be the top priority for this government not trade link with china thank the hon member for those kind word this case be bring under the official secrets act there be now new legislation in place which mean it be no long necessary to prove the enemy part of the test in order to bring successful prosecution that will make it easy to bring prosecution of this nature in future it be regretful that the previous government do not bring in this legislation soon have they do so expect we would not have find ourselves in the situation we be in today on point of order mr speaker may ask your advice unusually the attorney general do not sit in the house of commons when submit write parliamentary question to the attorney general they be answer by the solicitor general but the solicitor general refuse to provide answer for the attorney general only answer for herself today understandably the attorney general could not come to the house because he be not member of the house but the solicitor general repeatedly refuse to give answer on behalf of the attorney general she refer to the attorney general write answer and to select committee hearing which be ordinarily hold in private how do the house of commons hold the attorney general to account there be collective responsibility for the government to answer within this house the right hon member be absolutely right to ask the question but be not responsible for the answer that the solicitor general provide this go back to the frustration under the previous administration when the foreign secretary sit in the lords my view be that it be much hard but there be collective responsibility that question will be answer in this house be not go to keep the debate go now fishing and coastal growth fund urgent question to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if she will make statement on the fishing and coastal growth fund we be work closely with our fishing and seafood sector to ensure that they be vibrant profitable and sustainable and that we have healthy and productive marine environment that be why on may the government announce the fishing and coastal growth fund million investment that will support the next generation of fisher and breathe new life into our coastal community through the fund we have recognise the vital contribution that fishing and coastal community make to our economy local community and national heritage design the fund with stakeholder be paramount to its success and we want to work with industry and community to get their view on how to maximise value and target investment for maximum local impact that engagement be just begin we will consider investment in new tech and equipment to modernise the fleet in training and skill to back the next generation and in promote and support the seafood sector so that it can export across the world since the fund be announce wide range of stakeholder have call on the government to learn from previous fishery fund scheme and to devolve the funding instead of the funding be at uk level that be why on october the government in reaffirmation of our commitment to devolution confirm that the fishing and coastal growth fund would be devolve and that devolve government would have full discretion over how to allocate funding that approach enable each devolve government to design and deliver support in response to the specific need of their fishing and coastal community that will ensure that investment be target towards regional need and national view and that it well support coastal town and village it ensure that decision be take close to the community that the devolve government serve so the sector can thrive for generation to come although the government respect the devolution settlement would like to encourage collaboration across all government to maximise the fund impact as each government will have their own insight into how the funding can be use and will learn lesson over the fund lifetime thank the minister for her response would be fail in my duty to my constituent and indeed to people across scotland if do not reflect the anger dismay and sense of betrayal that have greet this set of fund allocation on march ahead of the much vaunted eu reset deal with the uk the prime minister tell the following from the dispatch box recognise the huge and historic importance of the fishing industry in his constituency and other and be determined to make the sector more secure sustainable and economically successful official report march vol but we be once again use as bargaining chip when eu access to scottish water be extend for another year way beyond what the eu negotiating team have hop for boris johnson use those in the fishing industry as poster boy for his reckless brexit campaign and then betray they afterwards and now this government have do exactly the same by reserve more than million for english coastal community over the next year while hand we pocket money despite scotland represent of our fishing capacity despite it land almost of these island catch and despite more than of all specie catch have be land by scottish vessel we have be offer mere of the fund my urgent question have be co sign by colleague from across the house who represent coastal community across scotland include those in orkney and shetland the outer hebrides and wales my welsh colleague be equally dismay at the crumb they have be offer recognise that the minister and her team may need time to get to grip with their brief but her predecessor say he intend to engage fully with devolved government and the scottish government have be ignore again urge the minister to look at this decision there be time before next march to take fresh look at these allocation and to recognise the crucial role that the fishing industry play in our beautiful coastal community around our massive coastline and in our island community across scotland if the minister be in any doubt about the strength of anger on this matter and about why it be so crucial repeat the offer make to she yesterday to come to my constituency and see for herself have be look at the history of seafood support fund the last one be uk seafood fund which be reserve by the then government nationally to be use in strategic way there be many vocal complaint that the fund should have be devolve we have now devolve fund in the way in which fund be always devolve use the barnett formula which give head uplift to devolve government for all other spending also note that the devolution settlement in the comprehensive spending review give the scottish government another billion that they can choose to spend in any way it be always open to they to support the sector which be an important industrial sector for they with some of the money devolve to they in the csr devolution settlement thank the minister for come to the dispatch box and the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan for raise this important issue there be question of fairness in the geographical distribution of the fund and the minister should consider that hope the funding will be review in due course there be another aspect to fairness too there should be fairness across the sector want the funding to be aim at new entrant to fishing community that face big challenge to do with depopulation crew and keep themselves go for example the funding can be use to allocate and buy quota so that local authority can distribute it to new entrant as happen to limited degree in orkney and in the western isles also want the funding to be aim at new opportunity this summer an lb tuna be land in my constituency from the north atlantic and it be to be sell at famous market in tokyo those be the kind of scheme place and fishing and coastal community that the fund should be aim at we should not just funnel the money to the already wealthy quota baron who dominate the industry and the airwave my hon friend have make some interesting observation about creativity which may well be apply to the fund we be try to co design the way the fund will work it be there for the next year so that we can be creative and think about how we support the young generation of people who wish to go into the industry some of the suggestion that he have make be intriguing and will certainly follow they up with he and other call the shadow minister this fund be weak apology from labour government who this year have sell out the uk fishing industry it be mere stick plaster rush one at good that ignore the proportion of fish catch in different part of these isle involve the devolved administrations poorly and ignore evidence base delivery and logic this fund be labour try to buy off the uk fishing fleet due to its disastrous year deal with the eu the deal be three time long than the deal labour seek it prevent britain from set annual fishing quota as other independent coastal state do fishing organisation have call the deal horror show for fisherman will the money be front loaded and spend where it will have the great benefit for industry and coastal community what input will fishing organisation and representative have in ensure that the fund be spend in the right place fishing be not just about the fish catch it be also about the people and marine wildlife involve can the government explain how the fund will support fisher mental health and effort to protect marine wildlife such as by end bycatch there be not enough detail for the industry to plan how will the fund be deliver how be it be target to support the fishing industry and how be the labour government support the next generation of fisherman and woman with the fund this fund be an example of the labour government try to buy off the industry with stick plaster rather than ensure that the good deal for the british fishing industry be the one that they negotiate with the eu the fund be about long term transformation and partnership we want to modernise the fishing sector support coastal regeneration and build resilience in the industry across the uk for that reason we will co design the fund with local community and the industry be not able to answer the hon gentleman question in detail at this precise moment because we seek to co operate with those who will be beneficiary when be in position to make further announcement certainly will as coastal mp be delighted that my constituency be select for million of pride in place funding how will those fund benefit coastal community around the country pride in place funding be new initiative from the ministry of housing communities and local government colleague will know that it be base very much on bottom up approach to improve place my understanding be that allocation will be give and direct by local board with community membership that be an important way of do regeneration it be not do thing to people from on high it mean try to involve and listen to those who live in those place who know what be good hope that we will be able to apply that principle to the use of these fund over time call the liberal democrat spokesperson the liberal democrats of course welcome any further investment in our fishing community but coastal town must have proper say in how the money will be spend the allocation of the funding must reflect the significance of the fishing industry across our isle the proud fisherman in my north cornwall constituency have be wrap up in so much red tape and face extra cost because of the tories botch brexit deal they now want proper management of fish stock and new byelaw to limit large vessel inside the six mile line what step be the government take to reverse that damage and provide our fisherman with great access to their large and close market how will the government use this fund to give great power and resource to coastal community to allow they to invest properly in their local area finally can the minister assure we that the fund will improve water quality to protect our fishing industry in the future on the hon gentleman last point clearly improve water quality be another policy area the coastal growth fund be not about improve water quality it be about build resilience help to modernise the fishing industry through high tech access to training and entry to the industry we must not mix up government support for different issue and try to shove everything into one policy the hon gentleman also ask about the reset for export purpose if we can do it properly the reset with the eu will enable the export of fish and catch with much less red tape than we have end up with post brexit there be big gain to be make from that likewise if we can get the free trade agreement to work properly it will increase the prospect of fishing industry export to other part of the world scottish salmon be renowned around the world for its quality and taste how be the government support the promotion of the scottish salmon industry around the world my hon friend be correct believe that the free trade deal with india take away all tariff on scottish salmon so hopefully there will be lot more of it head that way soon call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee welcome the minister to her new position have to say though if ever there be an illustration of the scale of the challenge face ministers in turn around the department this be it let we not forget that this fund be create because the prime minister roll over for further year the catastrophically bad deal that boris johnson give we for five year if the minister be sincere when she say that the aim of the government be to maximise local investment then use the barnett formula to distribute the funding be ocean go madness by volume and value shetland alone account for of the fish land in this country but scotland as whole will get only of the funding when will the funding formula be review and when will we hear exactly where the money will be spend and what it will be available for the right hon gentleman will have to ask the scottish government about what they be go to do with their devolved part of the fund he might also wish to ask they whether there be any extra money available from the devolve comprehensive spending review process because they get an extra billion to spend this year warmly welcome the government investment in sustainable fishing and shellfish industry which will create job and drive growth in coastal community such as mine will the minister provide timeline for when stakeholder such as the whitby district fishing industry training school and the whitby lobster hatchery will be formally engage in the process of develop and deliver this important fund as have say we be at an early stage in the process of see how we can do this we be committed to try to co design the fund so be happy to talk to my hon friend about how she wish that co operation to be take forward in the fantastic area of scarborough it be near bridlington where be bear which also have little to do with crab call the father of the house in lincolnshire we know all about fishing because grimsby use to be the world great fishing port it beggar belief that we coastal nation import twice as much fish as we export fisherman feel completely betray after year of vassalage to the european union and this late deal we be where we be we have this fund now so want to end on positive note by ask my favourite minister will she ensure that she use the fund to recreate fishing in area such as grimsby which now have miniscule amount of fishing to help they to modernise get more staff and rebuild our industry the father of the house know that flattery will get he everywhere obviously hold he in equally high esteem along with my hon friend the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn be more than happy to work out how we can use this fund to do precisely as he suggest welcome this fund the cornish fishing fleet which have suffer have put together join up proposal for our part of the fund so would be grateful if the minister could look at that the proposal talk about front load the investment multi year project funding science and research and data collection about the number of fish that we catch and the way we catch they and it particularly focus on career skill and infrastructure there be an announcement this week about an environmental lead regulator go into the development at falmouth port which will make massive difference and speed up port infrastructure redevelopment urge the minister and the government as whole to look at do more of that to look at local seafood production and to encourage people to eat local it be rather odd that in this country we have to export more of what we catch because we eat what be catch elsewhere expand the uk population view of what they can eat from the catch might make it easy to revive our fishing industry will be see group of cornish members next week to talk about some of their detailed suggestion about the fund and be interested in all creative idea this fund be set up to act as sweetener to our fishing community after they be completely sell out in the government eu brexit reset in that negotiation year of access to our sea be give away scotland land three quarter of the tonnage of fish in the uk and of the value of uk fishing come into scotland however of this million fund scottish fisherman will get only of the fund do it really make sense to the minister that scotland get of the fund when scottish fisherman bring in so much of the value of fishing if it do not make sense what be she go to do about it as have mention predecessor fund the uk seafood fund be complain about massively because it be ringfence and hold at uk level there be demand for it to be devolve so we have devolve it and use the barnett formula and that be the way the allocation work the scottish government can always spend some of their extra uplift the large uplift of scottish devolution settlement since devolution begin on support the fishing industry should they so wish brixham have the high value catch in england yet it be in torbay which be the most deprived local authority in the south west of england how will local level of deprivation colour the allocation of funding for england part of the fund and its use be certainly about try to create more vibrant and modern fishing industry that be resilient and part of that must be social resilience look forward to any of the view of the hon gentleman constituent on how the fund could well be use but we must remember that it be fishing relate not general it be there to modernise and make more resilient the uk fishing industry when the fishing and coastal growth fund be announce the government say that they have also secure new sanitary and phytosanitary agreement to slash red tape for uk seafood exporter and business can the minister tell the fishing fleet in king lynn brancaster and around the norfolk coast when that deal will actually be implement we be await the eu mandate which the commission tell we will be available by the end of november we be very anxious to then get on to do the sps deal as quickly as possible so that we can tear away all the red tape cause by brexit that have cause so much damage and make it so hard for the uk fishing industry to trade with our close neighbour some of our fishing fleet in wales be small metre boat the seafish economics of the uk fishing fleet report for the last year find that while scotland and england see strong fishing income growth profit in wales fall by nearly despite more active day at sea do the minister agree that funding base on what the sector and the fishing community need in wales would be far more fair and effective than the outdated barnett formula it be important that we try to support all our fishing industry around the uk the idea of devolve the fund be to allow the devolved administrations to do that in their particular area because they have more information and view on how good to support some million of extra support in the fund go directly to wales which can be use and decide upon by the senedd to support its local industry the east neuk fishing fleet in my constituency may not be deliver what shetland do in term of tonnage but it be critical and it face challenge around spatial mass and recruitment associate myself with the remark of my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael in relation to how the fund will be distribute may query the minister in relation to the year span of the plan obviously it be link to the eu agreement but what guarantee can the minister actually give we that the fund will last for those year otherwise what be propose become meagre no parliament can bind its successor but it be not usual for fund announce in this way to be suddenly end at the beginning of the next parliament we certainly want to ensure that we put in place plan that be so useful and effective that no subsequent government would even think of cut the fund it would be half thank the minister very much for her answer to all our inquiry absolutely welcome the fund and thank she for the goal that match the funding however with the northern ireland funding allocation for fisherman be base on the barnett consequential do not feel that the million designate for northern ireland be enough for the goal of investment in technology and equipment for new generation of fisherman as well as the necessary harbour update real concern have be that these money may not be ringfence to ensure that they be not fritter away on the goal and aspiration of devolved ministers rather than go directly to the fleet what guideline be in place to safeguard the use of this fund and to ensure that every penny rebuild our fishing fleet such as those in portavogie ardglass and kilkeel clearly the way that devolution work be that the government in westminster once we have distribute fund via the barnett formula can not ringfence they in any of the devolved administration that would be ridiculous misinterpretation of what devolution mean and be sure that those devolve administration would be the first to complain if we try the hon member thank he for his welcome to need to talk to the northern ireland assembly about what it be go to do we want the fund to be use for the purpose for which it be create but by definition the devolution settlement take the ringfence off so he must have his argument with the assembly thank my hon friend the member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan for secure this urgent question the aggregated coastline of my constituency be great than that of france so the fishing industry play crucial part in its economic wellbeing have barely survive the disaster of brexit this late decision by the uk government be another kick in the tooth to those fishing community we be all agree that this formula be fundamentally unfair so do the secretary of state for scotland come to the minister department at any point and specifically urge she to reverse this decision yes or no follow brexit since leave the eu under the trade and co operation agreement the uk receive an uplift in its fishing quota some of that uplift go to scotland that be worth million on figure so think scotland get reasonable deal remember that the uplift in the quota which create real income be lock in go forward this be very important and well attend urgent question and thank the minister for come to the chamber to answer it one of the argument make to for not grant it be that there will be westminster hall debate next wednesday though on an unrelated subject ban plastic know that argument be not from the minister who again thank think we can see that the urgent question be very important business of the house will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business the business for the week commence october will include monday october remain stage of the victims and courts bill tuesday october opposition day on motion in the name of the official opposition subject to be announce wednesday october remain stage of the sentencing bill thursday october general debate on property service charge follow by general debate on the age community and end of life care the subject for these debate be determine by the backbench business committee friday october the house will not be sit the provisional business for the week commence november include monday november second reading of the public office accountability bill in addition to the tribute that be pay early this week believe will be speak for all member in mourn the death on monday of our former colleague oliver colvile hon member hear hear oliver enter the house with in that glorious parliamentary generation of he be nationally famous for take wicket in india on live television for the lords and commons cricket team and for his memorable call in for hedgehog to become national emblem of the uk as he point out in this chamber hedgehog be prickly in character have voracious appetite and passion for garden and have noisy sex life official report november vol he say that he leave it to the deputy speaker to decide which of those trait he himself possess the leader of the house have rightly put some distance between himself and his predecessor in elect not to engage in political knockabout and be four square behind he on that in that spirit will content myself by simply note some of the news this week the uk have just record net borrowing of more than billion in september the high of any month since the crown prosecution service have be force to abandon the most consequential trial of chinese spy for many year four people have resign from the grooming gang inquiry panel and the lead candidate to be chair have withdraw newspaper have be brief by no that the new cabinet secretary will be remove in the new year after barely month in his post person deport under the government one in one out programme have immediately return by dinghy reportedly cite his terror at be in france the leader of the house may or may not wish to comment on those issue but there be two specific item affect many member of this house that bring to his attention the first be the imminent closure of the fruit and vegetable aid scheme as he will be aware the uk fresh produce sector be worth more than billion and be significant part of the uk farm economy there have be plan in place for some time to grow that sector rapidly over the next three year through public and private investment in equipment technology and infrastructure but the current scheme close at the end of this year without any movement to date on this crucial issue from the department for environment food and rural affairs will the leader of the house therefore ask the secretary of state to pick up this issue as soon as possible push ahead with the plan and make statement to the house so as to avoid risk to the horticulture sector local food production job and national food security the second issue relate to the government new local government fair funding review as the house will know this be fraught area of concern for members across the house and declare particular interest since it appear likely that herefordshire council my own county will face funding gap next year of around million or of its net budget that be gigantic sum which come on top of the withdrawal of the rural service delivery grant which support so many local service it be entirely unclear what the rationale for such cut could be especially for what be relatively poor and sparsely populated part of the country also note and bring to the attention of colleague across the house that the new formula will create serious problem for many local authority up and down this country include london borough the need for reform be clear but the government be still consult barely six month before the new formula be due to be roll out haste be the last thing anyone need in an area of this complexity and delicacy may impress on the leader of the house the need for care and deliberation from the government in how this consultation be carry out and then implement will he in turn express this concern to ministerial colleague and give proper time for these issue to be debate at the length they deserve in this chamber be pleased to see the shadow leader of the house back in his place this week just inform he if he do not already know that last week we discover in his absence that he have highly capable deputy in the hon member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont who may or may not be join we in deliberation later join the shadow leader of the house in pay tribute to oliver colvile who the house will remember fondly as the mp for plymouth sutton and devonport from to our thought be with his family apart from his other achievement not least in seek to save hedgehog my understanding be that he never break his party whip and therefore would have be chief whip dream can assure the house we also remember this week that it be year since the aberfan disaster when people lose their life include child we must never forget today also mark the launch of the royal british legion poppy appeal we remember those who serve and give their life in the service of our country include those who be member of this house also pay tribute on personal level and give my thank to kate wilson who be leave the cabinet office this week her career have span three decade and she support successive government work in parliament on behalf of the office of the leader of the house of commons and the government chief whip office and hope the whole house will join in wish kate the good in her future endeavour also join with you mr speaker in wish england all the very good in their rugby league match on saturday against australia we wish england well turn to the shadow leader of the house point first of all it be true that we need to get the balance right in these question between serious matter and from time to time knockabout have speak to he privately about this and be commit to end some of the knockabout but give the list that he present he be tempt as some of the issue might come up in question later the only thing will say be on my starting point last week on question about the economy any conservative member who ask question on the economy should begin with an apology on the substantive matter that the right hon gentleman raise the food and vegetable aid scheme he be strong advocate for the industry and particularly for his beautiful county of herefordshire where understand it have be great year for apple but not always for other veg and fruit will draw his remark to the attention of the defra minister who be sure will be happy to meet he if he seek meeting and who will also keep the house update on that matter on local government funding will respond by say that the current system of local authority funding have leave some place behind there be no doubt about that it be not fair system the previous government understand this very well in their fair funding review but as with many issue they just do not deliver on it we will make good on our commitment to introduce improvement to align funding with need and that will be the first time that have happen since we will also publish our response to the fair funding review later this autumn which will be follow by the publication of the provisional multi year settlement in the usual way there will be plenty of time to debate that last week the office for national statistics publish its late report on drug relate death in england and wales sadly for the consecutive year drug relate death have increase with harrowing people lose their life to drug in the last year key finding of the report be that almost half the death be relate to opiate and the number of death involve synthetic opioid call nitazene have increase fourfold give the scale of the loss of life that we be see and the stark regional disparity in the figure will the leader of the house please arrange for debate in government time on measure to urgently address this crisis my hon friend raise very important matter as former drug minister know that there be feeling across the house that we need to continue to bear down on the devastation that drug can bring to our local community there be interest across the house and urge my hon friend to ask for debate perhaps in backbench business time so that colleague can share their concern call the liberal democrat spokesperson first associate myself with the comment make about oliver colvile pass and the aberfan disaster wonder if we can have debate about rhetoric collide with reality early this week we have the chancellor after year of tell we that we can make brexit work finally concede that thing be not go so well on that front in the same week our resident patriot people who be so passionate about britain that they seek to import american politic to our shore discover that their late pet project have hit the buffer as well reform department of government efficiency or doge as hear teenage boy call it have succeed only in cut the number of reform councillor in kent from to the late spate of loss have come after reform kent county council leader concede that there be not much waste to cut in local government and that it will probably have to put up council tax just like everybody else as much as enjoy watch populist promise go pop there be serious point to be make about local government be on its knee as real term budget have be cut year after year demand have continue to rise more elderly people require social care there be more child with special need and more family be turn up at the council front door after become homeless for many local authority the vast majority of their budget be now spend on service for these vulnerable people leave little leave for the service that resident expect to see across their community the government fair funding formula be suppose to fix all this but in some place include my london borough of sutton it seem like it be set to make thing bad that be in no small part down to the fact that it utterly fail to take account of the real cost of housing particularly in london and the south east can the government give we assurance that they intend to fix the problem with their current proposal that they be go to listen to the feedback from london councils and the local government association and that they will come back with funding formula that work for local authority must say that request from the lib dems to bridge the gap between rhetoric and reality show how far they have come on brexit the cost of that decision be become clear but would point the hon member to the fact that the government be seek to achieve well deal with the european union as we hear in response to the urgent question not least for fishing community such as my own on local authority spending as say to the shadow leader of the house the current system be break the government be commit to fix it which the previous government do not do we do intend to make good on that commitment and the hon member will have to wait and see what the outcome be however he be right that this be concern not just for member on his side of the chamber but for those on the labour side and the government will bring forward our proposal in good time our intention be to make thing well and we will come back and explain in full how that be go to happen be incredibly proud that five of my constituent kelly buxton maddie buxton demi leigh walsh ollie taylor and the young nine year old blake webster all from evolution

debate on ensure access to sporting opportunity for all young people join my hon friend in wish the very good of luck to all those involve in evolution martial arts think that would make good topic for debate perhaps in westminster hall should he seek to apply for one it would enable the minister concern to talk about the government recent announcement of million for future grassroots facility which in no small part will ensure that facility be there to provide the opportunity from which his constituent be seek to benefit call the chair of the backbench business committee add my tribute to the late oliver colvile first come across he in the final selection in brent north where he be up against sajid javid and grant shapps he have to wait until to finally be elect in the famous cricket match in india when the lords and commons take on an indian select eleven remember two moment one be when he bowl completely bowl an indian state sponsor cricketer however the more important one be

january not only do they do that but we have very expensive and very loud firework that frighten animal and disturb child sleep people who need their sleep before they go to work be also severely inconvenience may we have statement from minister on what action will be take to prevent that from happen and to ensure that enforcement action be take not only on hour but to restrict the very powerful firework that cause such distress thank the hon gentleman for his question and for his work as chair of the backbench business committee we will endeavour to give as much notice as possible of upcoming backbench business day but take particular note of november and will get back to he as soon as possible the government intention be to minimise the negative impact of firework people do enjoy firework but at the same time community can be plague by their misuse we certainly support their considerate use but we need to reduce the risk and disturbance to individual and in particular to animal we have launch firework safety campaign for this firework series and current regulation control their sale availability and use include the maximum noise for consumer firework but the government will keep that under review our crime and policing bill which be currently in the lords will give the police great power to get persistent antisocial offender off our street whatever the

its mind up about the consultation yet there be already timeline for when those care home would be close down should the decision be make they include milbanke in kirkham thornton house just up the road and grove house in adlington in the chorley constituency will the leader of the house use his good office to ask the relevant minister to organise cross party meeting between myself the labour mps affect and you mr speaker so we can hold this reform lead county council to account for the decision it be make the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise this issue on behalf of his constituent and it go much far afield than his constituency we all know the concern about the possible closure of care home will therefore speak to the relevant minister in the hope that we can get the meeting he request will the leader of the house join in congratulate wednesfield in bloom for once again achieve gold in the britain in bloom award from ashmore park to the village our high street

of their home but what the homeowner have actually experience be significant disruption and energy bill that have go up the payment to the installer from the taxpayer be base on estimate of the household energy use before and after there be no fact involve can we have statement from the secretary of state for energy security and net zero on whether these scheme represent value for money for the taxpayer and the homeowner and whether they can be make more efficient in the future the hon lady raise an important question in two part first be these home get the improvement that we want they to have under our ambitious plan secondly be the taxpayer get good value for money will draw this matter to the attention of ministers and ensure that she get full response as it be business question mr speaker figure would come to work in my high visibility jacket over the summer recess my team organise series of roundtable in waltham forest and redbridge with family of child with special educational need and disability key theme highlight to be the need for more inclusive and collaborative approach wherever we can we need to avoid force family into adversarial and often chaotic process for education health and care plan do the leader of the house agree that with the right resource and environment all school should be able to meet all but the most complex of need without isolate child from their peer give that so many family have wait year to receive help can we have debate on this subject agree that every child should have access to the good education possible wherever he or she attend school it be very clear that the send system be break it do not work for parent or child and it do not really work for staff either we have invest an extra billion in send and as my hon friend know we be committed to reform the system we be get on with that because it be really important that the next generation of child do not suffer the trauma that the current and previous generation have suffer we keep the house update on these matter but be sure that if my hon friend wish to speak to minister they would be happy to confirm those thing too application for battery storage site be spring up all over the country include in my constituency and my constituent be certainly very concerned about they this month the uk health security agency write to my local district council raise concern about one such application discuss fire risk toxic gas the potential for particulate matter cause cancer and damage that could occur to the aquifer water supply and the environment among many other concern may we have debate in government time to discuss the risk of these site as do not think they have be consider in sufficient detail planning practice guidance encourage developer and local planning authority to engage with local fire and rescue service so that part of the process clearly need to be follow should the hon lady wish to raise this matter in debate be sure that other will join she in raise their concern and she will get response from minister the government have deliver increase funding to local council for school bus road and social care however the reform administration in kent be in chaos focus on internal dispute rather than deliver for my constituent at the weekend video emerge of the leader of the council shout and swear at other reform councillor who disagree with she as kent county council be responsible for billion of pound of taxpayer money can we have debate on local government accountability and how we can ensure that the people of kent receive the high quality local service they deserve there be theme emerge this morning on the difference between the offer that reform make in order to get into local government and what actually happen in reality as the prime minister say at prime minister question yesterday what people get if they vote reform be total chaos and broken promise official report october vol elect representative have duty to local taxpayer to spend their money wisely my hon friend may wish to seek an adjournment debate to far expose the role of reform in kent county council in newsnight interview prince andrew state that he break off tie with the notorious international paedophile jeffrey epstein after go to visit he for four day in new york we have since learn through email chain that he in fact get in contact with jeffrey epstein subsequently to that and state that he be look forward to play some more follow those revelation and further allegation that be in the public domain have lay motion before this house that call on the government to listen to parliamentarian the public and victim and take legislative action to remove the dukedom from prince andrew that this house call on the government to take legislative step to remove the dukedom grant to prince andrew when will the government introduce that legislation first any discussion of this issue need to begin with the simple important fact that at the heart of this should be remember the victim of jeffrey epstein so we do that the question of title be primarily question for his majesty know that there have be speculation about legislation but the palace have be clear that it recognise that there be other matter that this house need to be get on with and we be guide in this by the palace that do not mean that the house can not find way to debate these matter whether it be the matter of title or of the finance which know be also under question the right hon gentleman have be here long enough to find way to make that happen it be time to end the taboo around the menopause today government announcement that menopause will be include in the plus health check be huge step in the right direction it will mean that woman across my constituency of north warwickshire and bedworth will get the medical support that they need however we must go far so that every woman get the support that she need in her workplace will the leader of the house support debate in government time on how to work across government to ensure that manager department and business give all woman the support that they need in the workplace in order to thrive my hon friend be absolutely right it be time to end the taboo and pay tribute to she for she campaigning on this important issue we be improve menopause support through the employment rights bill which will require employer to produce an action plan show what they be do to support menopausal staff there be westminster hall debate last week to mark world menopause day and be sure that there will be further opportunity for member to discuss these matter in my private member bill receive royal assent become the equipment theft prevention act in order to bring it into force some statutory instrument have to be introduce police force up and down the land as well as police and crime commissioner hail it as major step forward in prevent agricultural equipment theft and indeed power tool theft as be envisage in the original debate on the bill yet last week have letter from the policing minister tell that the content of the act would be hollow out with the requirement for immobiliser on quad bike remove and only forensic marking require for gps unit that be bad let down for rural community up and down the land so can we have at minimum statement or well still debate in government time to explore what this government real approach be to rural crime without the full provision of the act it be free ride for the criminal rise order can we speed up because lot of people want to get in and it be only fair that everybody get chance the government believe that rural crime be huge problem and be determined to act which be why we set up the rural crime strategy and announce new funding for the national rural crime unit we publish the government response to the call for evidence which outline the scope of the secondary legislation need to implement the equipment theft prevention act on october and we aim to introduce the secondary legislation in parliament this year there will be opportunity for the hon gentleman to raise his very valid concern every year thousand gather for safe organise firework display however this time of year also bring dread for many due to antisocial and inconsiderate firework use as we have hear it cause misery and distress for animal and many vulnerable and elderly people welcome the early comment from the leader of the house on this issue but can we have debate on the regulation of firework outside of formal display to minimise their impact on people and animal and to ensure that they be sell and use responsibly my hon friend and constituency neighbour be an excellent advocate for her constituency and thank she for raise this issue as we have already hear it be of concern not just to our constituent but to member across the house council and the police have power to protect the public from misuse and harm but it be up to this house to make the case as to whether those power represent the full extent need would ask my hon friend to apply for debate so that those issue can be explore perhaps in backbench business time last week billington structures one of the uk lead structural steelwork contractor announce proposal to close its yate site with job at risk business of all shape and size be struggle due to the increase in national insurance contribution and rise energy cost will the leader of the house agree to debate in government time on what need to be include in the upcoming autumn budget to avert further job loss order before the leader of the house respond we only have minute to go so question must be short and answer even short the hon lady would not expect to speculate about what be in the budget but there will be adequate time during the debate on it to address the concern she raise while it be obviously necessary to improve the life and dignity of old people do the leader of the house agree that in order to build fairer britain there need to be some rebalancing of attention and resource towards the young generation will he therefore consider debate in government time on what call youth triple lock member have consult young people could then discuss what such measure might include for example free bus travel uplift maintenance loan by inflation or voucher scheme for constructive activity my hon friend raise number of important issue we be determined to get the balance right and to get well future for our young people he may wish to seek an adjournment debate or backbench business debate to raise those concern the birmingham bin strike have now cost taxpayer million resident have have no recycling collection since last christmas and the city have lose million in income due to no garden waste collection the strike be do irrevocable damage to the reputation of the west midland include my constituency can the leader of the house ask the new minister for local government to update the house on this situation and on how the government be go fix it yes can young adult in my constituency be still wait more than five month for driving test it be just not fair they can not get to work they can not have apprenticeship will the leader of the house join in push the department for transport to do something about this very quickly yes will thank my hon friend for raise this matter which have be highlight by number of member have also raise it with the department for transport the government be accelerate consultation into the abuse of the drive test booking system and the reason that we do not have enough place will ensure that the transport secretary have hear his concern directly banking hub give resident and business much need access to cash and banking service and can drive up town centre footfall to support local business will the leader of the house grant debate on the importance of banking hub and do he agree that the beautiful historic and incredible town of yarm would be the perfect location for such hub the government be commit to provide more banking hub and indeed some have open the hon member could ask for backbench business debate because be sure his concern be share by other but let gently say that the beautiful and historic town of whitley bay get its banking hub on friday dementia be the lead cause of death in this country and my constituent tell of not only the mental decline but the physical condition poor mobility infection and increase pain level that sufferer experience do the leader

representation and opportunity our strength be in our unity of purpose when every community can see themselves in the national story and know that national purpose care for they and when every young person know that there be space for their first too then we will truly be the country that we claim to be if the house will indulge when listen to the minister be think about my own parent story especially that of my mother who would carry into this country who would have think that would make history by sit here in the speaker chair but my mother story be far more relevant and her name be farzand begum call the shadow minister and my constituency neighbour mims davies thank you madam deputy speaker be very proud of my constituency neighbour it be wonderful to see you in the chair this

achievement of black britons but on the strength resilience and leadership that have shape our nation this be rightly moment to honour those who stand firm in the face of adversity lead and continue to lead with pride and transform institution community and culture be jealous of the minister visit with lord woolley of woodford when be at the department for work and pensions try hard to coincide with he but covid get in the way so be delighted that the minister be able to achieve that the conservatives agree with the minister and would like to state clearly that black history be british history black britons have shape the nation in which we live in way that we be only begin to recognise and grasp fully recognise that myself as learn more so agree with the minister wholeheartedly and in the spirit of many thursday afternoon debate be sure we all recognise that there have be progress and that there be always more to do from sport to science politic to public service black britons have be weave into the fabric of our society and they have become household name and inspiration they include member of the current team of victorious lionesses as well as those from previous team one of the most wonderful lady who have have the chance to meet be nikita parris be big fan but other include alex scott jess carter and many more they prove that people can be black british and proud which be message that we need to hear right now other inspiration include dame floella benjamin who sit in the other place be show my age and my era when say that she be on my screen when be grow up and the amazing age defy naomi campbell well as idris elba obe sir lewis hamilton and sir steve mcqueen join the minister in wish baroness lawrence of clarendon very happy birthday for tomorrow when we think of athlete we remember jessica ennis hill and katarina johnson thompson hermove east grinstead which be champion by the town mayor be try to get more woman involve in sport we also have the this girl can campaign but hermove be grow focus in my town and across the country we be delighted when dame kelly holmes give it her seal of approval show that she be inspire another generation as the minister rightly say each generation stand on the shoulder of previous pioneer it be right that we celebrate the anniversary of the race relations act which be landmark in our legislative history stand at the opposition dispatch box find it remarkable how many turn point and change happen in this very building how amazing that we as elect representative get to stand on the shoulder of those previous pioneer and work together as we commemorate this milestone during black history month we reflect on how far we have come and reiterate how far we have to go we remember the life and legacy of pioneer such as paul stephenson who lead the bristol bus boycott in and lord herman ouseley the former chair of the commission for racial equality among other their courage and conviction lay the groundwork for progress that we see today some of member of parliament come from ethnic minority background which be progress representation be match by action we be still work on that in the conservative party but we continue to push in that direction we honour the windrush generation just as the minister do whose story be central to black british history the voyage of those on the empire windrush be now rightly see as defining moment that lead to the contribution of caribbean migrant include many who make immense change to our nhs some of nhs staff be black build on the legacy that begin with thousand of caribbean woman answer the call to fill staffing shortage in the and give up their life to help we with our life that give chance to mention the pin that be wear have get so many on today feel like we be pin up sometimes which be the black history month badge that get from amazon who would have think it amazon it really have everything do it recently visit amazon in my constituency and be give badge of the amazon emblem peccy who be little parcel there be display and it have be do some work with staff in my constituency we really see everything in the wonderful job of be an mp and that be wonderful to see as the minister highlight black history in britain do not begin with windrush it stretch back century the first black mp be believe to have be elect in many child rightly know and recognise the immense contribution mary seacole make during the crimean war that speak to our nation long stand and complex history which we all need to understand and learn about this week we celebrate the trafalgar day despite the horrendous and shameful role that britain play in the atlantic slave trade in the century the century see turnabout with the royal navy be use to hunt down slave ship it be estimate that up to africans be liberate from slavery in america as result of those direct action which we should rightly be proud of and all grow to understand be proud too that when the world face an enemy of the utmost racism during the second world war caribbean man and half million africans serve britain to fight back against the tyranny that face they those story be often airbrush from our national memory and not fully understand so challenge those omission be part of black history month and something that we must all do we must also confront the present the racism and abuse in the euro final in be stark reminder of the work that be still need as the minister say there be still too much racist abuse on social medium particularly around sport as sport minister take that head on and work incredibly hard to tackle that abuse on the pitch which have be see too often in sport sport should provide an opportunity to celebrate so know that past and current colleague will continue to work tirelessly on the issue of racism and wide issue our landmark inclusive britain action plan tackle racial disparity and be particularly proud of that initiative from our time in government before we leave office we deliver on of the action in just one year after the plan be announce as minister be proud to work on access to investment social mobility and entrepreneurship for all in government it be vital that this government build on that and lean into it as the minister say it be vital to understand ethnicity pay gap reporting and would be keen that when she can the minister share the response to enable scrutiny and understanding of any potential legislation as members of parliament we must ensure that black history month remain space for reflection education and importantly celebration and never division it must not become political football as the leader of the opposition have say and as have reiterate from the dispatch box today teach black history as british history be vital include highlight the contribution of figure such as lord ribeiro pioneer in keyhole surgery and lionel turpin world war one veteran whose story deserve further recognition look forward to celebrate with other the outstanding contribution of those in our constituency and far afield of whom we be so proud and hear contribution from member across the house agree with the minister this be positive story that we can all continue to write we can celebrate unity we can reject tokenism and we can boost real opportunity and outcome so that social mobility be truly here for all it give huge pleasure to call the mother of the house in this black history month be sorry to have to say that any objective assessment of the current state of racial justice in this country would not be wholly positive one representation be the great success story we have to acknowledge the progress that be register we have black female leader of the opposition pakistani heritage home secretary black caribbean heritage lord chancellor and at least black and minority member of parliament when enter the house in there be no black mp whatsoever and for year be the only black female mp sadly increase representation have not be accompany by the improvement in policy and practice that some of we would have like to see many in this house have wax lyrical about the contribution make by the windrush generation of migrant from the caribbean and share that admiration for their bravery and their accomplishment my mother be one of that generation of west indian woman who come to this country and help to build our nhs however point out to the house that at this point the majority of windrush migrant have not have their compensation if the minister be not aware of that urge she to look into it and ensure that these man and woman get their compensation before they pass away although we can wax lyrical about the windrush generation today all too often in the current political debate migrant be speak about as if they make no contribution at all we say you can only come if you be highly pay you can not automatically bring your family we will charge you thousand of pound even though we need you you may have no right as citizen or worker we may even expel you from this country where we have previously grant you and your family the legal right to stay that be not contribute to the cherishing of our migrant class it be create class of third class gastarbeiter among all these other thing it be be suggest by those on both side of the house that you may have to train british worker for your job be old enough to remember when employer be responsible for in work training sadly this policy be the logical conclusion of brexit and of put the interest of business way before the interest of people we should remember that all this debate on migration be largely aim at people with black or brown skin do not hear the same anxiety and concern about migration from hong kong or ukraine thank the right hon lady for the point she be make do she share my concern that much as in the us where rhetoric have shift through sudden strategy away from explicit conversation about race to cod reference about race we should be concern by the change in rhetoric we no long see racial term be deploy and instead talk about thing such as cultural coherence do agree we have to be very careful about talk about progress when as my colleague say lot of the debate on race be pursue by use code but the issue still remain the colour of our skin the hue and cry about immigration today do not apply to migrant from hong kong or ukraine be not in favour of that but the target and constant demonisation of migrant clearly highlight theme sadly the theme be racism matter be hardly any well for the long establish black and asian british community in this country sadly we have have successive government who attempt to deny the existence of racism at all one issue that feel very strongly about be educational underachievement even after poverty be account for mixed white and black caribbean child and black caribbean child have among the low level of educational achievement among other thing black child see three time the amount of exclusion as white child they be go into university in great number but the proportion be low than in the population as whole the level of exclusion for child both black and white have alarming consequence for their life chance former director general of the prison service martin narey say that on the day child be exclude from school they might as well be give date and time to turn up in prison if we wish seriously to address the life chance of this generation of black and minority ethnic child we really have to address issue in relation to education to my knowledge none of the four past secretaries of state for education or even the current secretary of state for education have ever mention black child and education they prefer instead to speak solely of the disadvantage of white working class pupil will give another example of this rampant colour blindness when it come to education the children wellbeing and schools bill which be currently go through parliament make no mention of race this year child safeguard practice review say that there be significant silence when it come to talk about race and racism in child safeguarding have work for many year on issue in relation to black child in education and plead with ministers to start to address this issue we be talk about million of child who be be fail by the system what be true of education be true for black and asian people throughout their life and across all important area such as job pay housing healthcare and mental health as well as in all aspect of the criminal justice system remind the house that black people face high police stop and search rate high rate of arrest and high rate of conviction and be more likely to receive custodial sentence for long period there be two tier justice system in this country and the victim be black people and increasingly muslim man on top of all that those suffer these indignity have to listen to daily diet of claim that they be all drain on public service without migrant many of our public service would not be as strong as they be they have to hear that they get preference in housing which be sick joke as anybody who deal with housing casework in ethnic minority community will know they have to hear that they be all sexual predator and paedophile which be the most monstrous lie straight from the political playbook finally they face the indignity of be tell that those who want to take to the street try to burn asylum seeker out of their accommodation and randomly attack muslims have legitimate concern it be one thing to wax sentimental about the bravery and accomplishment of an early generation but they be without exception migrant be confident that they would want debate that look not just back but forward to fair and more just society in relation to race and migration be aware that many member of this house be not pay attention to this debate but hopefully some civil servant will read it in hansard my parent come to this country in the they do not come to be drain on the public sector or to harm society in any way they come to help rebuild britain after the second world war they come to contribute and yes they come to make well life for their child have to pay they credit have to honour they and that whole generation so ask the minister and the house that we move beyond the sort of debate we be have on migration and that we address issue in relation to race include education and crime we have to look at those issue otherwise everything we be say in today debate be purely lip service call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be an honour and privilege although also slightly daunting to follow the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott who speak so powerfully on this subject this year theme for black history month standing firm in power and pride speak to long and ongoing history of courage resilience and leadership of drive change in the face of injustice and to the pride purpose and strength find in black community around the world we owe an enormous debt to the black british community from the windrush generation foundational role in build the nhs to the countless trailblazer who push boundary in politic the art science and activism their legacy be weave into the fabric of this country however the work be far from do too many people still face daily injustice from racism and hate speech to unequal opportunity and barrier that prevent full participation in society prejudice continue to harm life community and trust we must acknowledge that reality and act to change it be proud that the liberal democrats be commit to stand firm in this fight we reject racism in all its form and be determined to drive meaningful change but very sadly we see again last summer that racism be still far too prevalent in our society it creep into everyday life especially for people of colour include my constituent who tell at surgery last week that his wife no long feel welcome he tell that he fear for the future of his mixed race child and desperately want more politician to stand up and stand firm against prejudice and hate to call it out for what it be it be vital that those of we with platform do so want to be clear racism be abhorrent it be not representative of my wonderful diverse community in chelmsford or by and large our wonderful country as whole and it must be call out like the rest of the uk chelmsford have proud history of be welcome home for everyone and for the avoidance of any doubt be proud to say that we be well for it recognise this my party and be clear that we must address past injustice include implement the windrush lesson learn review and end the conservatives hostile environment policy let turn to an issue that be very close to my heart maternity service think everyone across the house know that maternity service in general be in dire strait indeed although applaud the incredible hard work of midwife and nhs staff who be battle system that be so obviously not fit for purpose the problem be so systemic that casual observer might be forgive for think that woman have only be give birth for few year and countless other have speak on this matter on many occasion it be crucial that the government implement the immediate and essential action in the ockenden review and reverse their decision to end the ringfencing of million for vital improvement to maternity care mention this specifically today because liberal democrats be clear that we must urgently address the appalling disproportionately high maternal mortality rate for black woman and eliminate racial disparity in maternal health this must happen right now it surely can not be right that we continue to accept these inequality today on the promise that there will be more parity in the future look to our friend in other country recently return from british group inter parliamentary union delegation to senegal in west africa it be wonderful to return to country where have spend year as student it be especially heartening to see the progress that senegal have make in the intervene quarter of century and the pride with which its elect official talk of the strength of their democracy in region beset by violent conflict they be keen to strengthen tie with other country around the world especially the uk like we they be ambitious when it come to increase trade work together for the mutual benefit and growth of both of our economy and to tackle the huge inequality that persist it be clear to that work together with our friend across the world be what truly help keep we all safe indeed wear pin today as symbol of the new uk senegal friendship group that we have form to far that aim close to home pay tribute to some of my own constituency local organisation which affirm this year black history month theme of standing firm in power and pride day in and day out the over black men forum not for profit group that have be establish in chelmsford and across essex for some year and be chair by my constituent enitan kane do excellent work improve the health and community voice of black man over the age of and aim to reduce future dependency on the nhs among old black man work with uk government departments the nhs local council and sport organisation now have project across much of the south and east of england provide critical support for community lead programme that improve this marginalised group health that tackle inequality and that challenge prejudice more recently have launch an oral history project its title soro soke be from yoruba phrase translate to speak up as it say it be highlight the untold story memory and experience of old black man in essex encourage they to speak out raise their voice and demand change create such project where black people be give space to remember and celebrate their cultural heritage community and local story be so important as point out this be true for number of reason from essex bear black british youth learn about the experience of their elder to celebrate the joyfulness of our diverse community in essex and create an inclusive and accurate history of our british isles more broadly we must all preserve history teach young generation about how far britain have come and draw inspiration knowledge and courage from such story to continue the work of challenge discrimination and improve the life of the black community on that note black history month also present wonderful opportunity to build community which be one of the great tool we have against division and hatred in my constituency the new generation development agency be run some brilliant community event support by chelmsford city council and the local business improvement district chelmsford for you whether it be ngda chattie pattie drop in session or provide an open space for people to share their view and experience of race equality these event provide space for the recognition of local black community voice and teach other how to be well ally they help we all to well empathise and strengthen our relationship with our neighbour they reinforce that human really be not that different from one another and we should all be sceptical of those who claim otherwise we all have dream we all experience loss and love and we all have one life this black history month as we honour the pioneer the local activist and the next generation liberal democrats be clear we stand with you we will stand firm in your power and pride and we will continue work for more just equal and inclusive united kingdom call dawn butler thank you

government time something that have call for many time before forget want to congratulate brent council on its excellent black history month event yesterday also thank the shadow minister the hon member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies for her speech her word be always really quite move the only thing be that when we look behind the shadow minister and see none of her colleague it make we think that she be the only one who think like that in her party however we be glad that she do and we chair the all party parliamentary group on woman in parliament together and we do that very well be pleased that we have at least one good voice in her party october be an exhausting month for lot of we and that be not just because it be diwali and yesterday be hindu new year and we celebrate bandi chhor divas too be proud yesterday to wear my sari in the chamber and wrap it myself do odd squat try to get in to ask question in prime minister question be not call and my sari stay intact so be proud of myself october be also breast cancer awareness month although have avoid lot of that this year as it be trigger but we can not avoid talk about black history month see powerful affirmation on jools tv that go love myself love my skin love my hair my melanin think that be so amazing it be for kid but adult can take lot from that too since last year black history month we form the parliamentary black caucus the found member include josh babarinde the mother of the house diane abbott order we do not read out the name of member their constituency will suffice thank you madam deputy speaker should know well will have to google all their constituency anyway we have some amazing found member of the black caucus and that will go from strength to strength among all the positivity be tired when we see people march in london lead by far right racist it be absolutely exhausting it be trigger too and not just for but for my parent generation and for everybody who have ever suffer racism it be true that not everybody on the march be racist but there definitely be hell of lot of racist on that march when people say want to get my country back wonder back from whom there be south african call the shot the racism that have increase and escalate since march be not even new it be quite old and it be from the apartheid era and slavery will read the house just few of the racist message that have be send to one say you not english and you do belong in the country deport yourself say there be no our you african monkey rojamwej say pipe down monkey say fuck off you ape another one say you be go home you know it we know it it just get bad and bad and it be not new they have not even upgrade their racism it be just old pathetic and annoying but it be scary young lady who come to work for year ago say that she have never see the word nigger so often in her life and she do not expect that the mother of the house receive more abuse than every single mp in this house sometimes wonder about this disregard or disrespect when come into parliament in there be only one black woman mp the mother of the house the mother of the house have suffer offensive and horrendous abuse what do we do how do we stop it how do we end it let we start with the flag the flag be for everybody who be british right those people who have try to weaponise it not try to they have have always weaponise it my brother be chase down the road by skinhead racist thug wrap in the flag to kick their head in and have always say that if we be go to reclaim the flag we have to reclaim it with narrative and with context we can not just put the flag on everything and think it will be okay would like to see couple of thing would like the government to work with the royal family to change the word empire to excellence mention that many year ago but now be the time the royal family be look to modernise and it would be great way to modernise because at the end of the day we be recognise people who be excellent in this country if we be to unite instead of fight what would change that be what lot of people be scared about the people who be try to get other people to hate be monetise that hate as we have see with lot of people money do not make you happy the truth be that if someone get their joy and energy from hat other people or from racism there be something misalign in how their brain work racism and hate make most of we tired it be absolutely exhausting but say to the racist that they have not break the mother of the house and they will not break from time to time might get tired but will continue to stand firm in power and alongside will be my ally they will be black white brown and everyone in between because there be more of we than there be of they if people do not believe there be clip of an incident that happen in brent just recently with white woman call miranda she run the tiny pod podcast and she witness young black man be pull out of his car by police officer and his head bang on the floor blood be dripping from his head and she record the whole thing she be extremely vocal in her allyship and advocacy to ensure that no other harm be do to this young black man the police say to she to move away and she say be not move away be stay right here in the end the young black guy say no want she with he say that not because she be white woman but because she be protect he as say there be more of we than there be of they in wembley arena next year stand up to racism hope not hate and other organisation be go to hold love music hate racism concert it will be one of the big in the country and it will be powerful event be try to get adele to come back if anybody know she let know we will have the big name in the music industry and we will show how great britain be through our diversity and our love of music and not racism want to end with some word from john lewis the civil right activist he say do not get lose in sea of despair be hopeful be optimistic we use to say that ours be not the struggle of one day one week or one year ours be struggle of lifetime or even many lifetime and every one of we from every generation must do our part and if we believe in the change we seek then it be easy to commit to do all we can never ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble necessary trouble because the responsibility be ours alone to build well society and more peaceful world our power lie not in money medium or control our power lie in our number and in our courage and our collective fight for justice it be against they those who try to divide we but when we stand united we will win with hope and optimism hope adele get that message it be quite scary to follow the hon member for brent east dawn butler and the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott who be both formidable advocate against injustice have do several debate with the hon member for brent east and have so much respect for how she speak to the chamber she be talk about that tiredness that people be feel just now from constantly have to fight for every single thing and constantly have to argue against the injustice be serve on her constituent and mine as well as those of significant number of member across this house it be absolutely tiring but if she or the mother of the house ever want cup of tea bit of allyship or as we say in aberdeen bosie cuddle they should give we shout we be happy to oblige and to be unite together the mother of the house highlight the cognitive dissonance that some politician seem to have they stand up and talk about black history month while simultaneously refuse to discourage people who be protest against migrant that be really important we need to remember that we can not talk about the injustice that so many people face just once year in this chamber we need to be fight every single day every day that we have energy we should be use it to ensure that there be an anti racist narrative across society represent aberdeen north one of the more diverse constituency in scotland will focus on the city of aberdeen because the census result be break down by city rather than constituency so it be much easy to do that about of people in aberdeen come from bme background which be not that high but over of people in aberdeen be not bear in the united kingdom which be pretty high for scotland some of people in aberdeen be bear in nigeria there be nigerians people who be bear in nigeria not the descendant of immigrant live in aberdeen we have significant number of people who be work every day who be contribute and who be make difference will mention some individual from both the past and present who have make difference in aberdeen and scotland however note that there be so many people whose name we will never mention who be work quietly as carer or in our nhs and do job that be really difficult have be carer and it be really hard physical job that so many people do not want to do to those who be make people live well and do miracle every single day and whose name do not mention thank you for your contribution it be massively appreciated will first talk about some figure from the past there be wonderful part of the university of aberdeen website that talk about the history of black aberdonians and people who graduate from the university christopher james davis who be from barbados graduate in we think he be the first black graduate in medicine and then go to volunteer as doctor in sedan during the franco prussian war sadly he die from smallpox in the same year that he graduate nathaniel thomas king graduate from aberdeen in he move back to nigeria and be one of the trailblazer in improve sanitation in lagos again he be another medicine graduate from aberdeen edward tull warnock be dentist in aberdeen and glasgow his father be bear in barbados although edward be bear in folkestone his brother be probably the first black commission officer in the british army as say edward himself be dentist and he be not call up to the war because of that we need dentist during that time particularly because so many people who volunteer or who be call up be reject on the basis of the quality of their tooth and how likely they be to be ill as result so dentist be often an exempted occupation edward practise as dentist for significant number of year latterly in glasgow again he be real black trailblazer potentially the first black register dentist in scotland in some of these case be say word such as potentially and can not talk about early woman graduate of aberdeen university because the register just be not there the roll be there but there be not enough information and the research have not be do the university be look to rectify that in the future but again there be story that will maybe never be tell because we just do not have the information want to highlight some of the people in my constituency and in aberdeen more widely who be make difference and whose story might not otherwise be hear bertha yakubu mbe come to aberdeen in and really struggle with isolation bertha and the african women group in aberdeen write book call african women speak one of the most powerful book have ever read it be about their experience of come to aberdeen and scotland how different it be from the country they be bear in how different the experience be and how difficult they find it to integrate to find fellow feeling and to find love and support in the community in aberdeen it really be brilliant book and urge member to get hold of it bertha now do huge amount of work support woman who be suffer from domestic violence by provide they with kinship love and support and by just be there for they that be sometimes what people need to gain the courage to flee want to talk about ify anyaegbu who be in charge of faceyouth charity that focus on mental health it focus on young people and on reduce the disadvantage that they feel in aberdeen have meet she on number of occasion and she be an absolute force of nature she will do everything that she can to try to reduce disadvantage in aberdeen jane akadiri be the founder of touch of love an empower and uplift christian community in the city it do huge amount of good particularly with disadvantaged group and people on the low income florence igboayaka the founder of the period place have write book call the period comic which be excellent if young people age between eight and want to learn about what period be like the comic be fabulous place to start and thoroughly recommend it she have also create line of period product for woman with heavy period flow which understand lot of african woman have across the uk significant number of woman from all heritage be not serve well by the period product currently on the market she also start in aberdeen the walk to give she voice which be focus on ensure that woman feel safe and can walk in their community and talk about the thing that matter to they we should be able to talk about period and the menopause and to get the support that we need those be some incredibly inspiring woman and my city would not be the place it be today without all the work that they do in our community the hon lady may not know that be pilot in the royal air force use to do lot of work advocate for young black people enter stem science technology engineering and mathematic industry so have the great privilege of visit aberdeen on number of occasion unfortunately will not be able to visit next week when the association for black and minority ethnic engineers hold its annual conference in the hon lady constituency the association be create by dr nike folayan mbe and be support ably by folayo osekita who be representative of leonardo will the hon lady join in recognise the excellent work that they do create new history for her town absolutely agree have meet the association for black and minority ethnic engineers unfortunately do not realise it be have its conference next week but thank the hon member for let know it be fabulous organisation there continue to be very tough glass ceiling in engineering we be get huge number of more diverse candidate and graduate come through in engineering but at the high level of senior management for example in the energy industry we be struggle to make that breakthrough and to have enough black and minority ethnic individual so support his comment support the association for black and minority ethnic engineers and will do everything can to assist it in break that glass ceiling there be also glass ceiling for female engineer there be intersectionality here it be particularly difficult for black female engineer to get to the high senior management position will keep do everything can to support that organisation and other to build on what the mother of the house say and what the hon member for brent east say about the protest the societal view be express right now be horrific however there have be an undercurrent for very long time and this be stuff that people have be think part of what drive some people to vote for brexit be view such as there too much immigration do want all these people here be sure all labour members have read the ragged trousered philanthropists they will know that it talk about the conservatives of the time put forward the racist narrative that all your problem be cause by the immigrant we just need to get rid of they this have be narrative for year and we still need to counter it perhaps more so today than ever and certainly more than we have need to at any other point in my adult life we need to do everything we can to stop these racist be allow to say anything they want agree with the hon member that some of this negativity around race and asylum have always be there do she agree that the rise of reform have embolden people who always think like that to speak publicly in that way do she also agree that none of the party in this house should be chase after reform that be brick wall for progressive party could not agree more people have have these racist thought and have keep quiet about they but they be now embolden to say they out loud because of people like the reform mps and because of the racist narrative be bring forward no one should be look to chase policy such as mass deportation none of we should be put forward those policy we should recognise and celebrate the impact of people who have choose to live in our country want to tackle one of the narrative put forward by some of the racist in my constituency they have say that the saltire be christian symbol and be only for white christians that be not true the saltire be for anybody who be bear in scotland or choose to come to our country to live to contribute to work life and to be part of our wonderful vibrant community it be for every single one of we it be not just for christians and not just for white people it be for everyone we can all everybody live in scotland everybody bear in scotland and frankly everybody who want to celebrate and love the saltire and claim it for our own know be take quite bit of time but want to talk about few more issue particularly some government policy really appreciate the work be do on remove the pay gap include the ethnicity and gender pay gap it be look at what more can be do and particularly at intersectionality and case where people be multiply disadvantaged all of we have responsibility to check our privilege we have responsibility to think about the fact that we have our privilege we get high salary as members of parliament and we may be educate white and middle class while other people face multiple detriment and multiple form of judgment and prejudice they be find it hard and hard to make it through they be so tired because of the constant drip drip or sometimes gush of negativity against particular immigrant few thing in the immigration system disadvantage people who be not white there be still significant issue with the refusal of visitor visa for people from country where people be not white there be significant refusal rate for visitor visa for people from nigeria still struggle to fathom why some constituent should be less able to have their mum come over to see they graduate than other who be bear in another country but be white it feel like there be racial element to that any work that can be do to ensure that the visitor visa system be fair and to make it more likely that people can get their relative over to visit would be incredibly worthwhile the no recourse to public fund system have now open up and apply to far more white people than it use to disagree entirely with no recourse to public under the system there be family who be struggle to feed their child there be family who be not support throughout covid what particularly bother be that they include family with young child do not think we should have the no recourse to public fund system but if we be go to continue to do so do not think it should ever apply to family in which anybody be under five or under child should never go hungry because family have no recourse to public fund particularly if family member have live and work here sometimes their have no recourse to public fund be no fault of theirs home office mix up have put they in that situation and they have be ban from work for period that be horrific and no recourse to public fund need to go on the change in residency requirement for leave to remain so many of my constituent have contact say buy house in aberdeen because be under the impression that would get indefinite leave to remain after five year stay the government have now change that to year do know if they or the next government whoever they may be will ever allow the right to stay but will have to continue to pay health surcharge every year in the meantime those people may have choose to live in aberdeen in order to work in our nhs and to make our community well do not think we should have any change at all in the residency requirement but any move to make change retrospective would be incredibly unfair there would need to be an equality impact assessment to show what percentage of people disadvantage by the policy be from black and minority ethnic background be willing to bet that the figure would be incredibly high and it be therefore policy that no progressive government should pursue however want to be positive want to talk about the incredible work that my constituent have do but could not do so without recognise that it be scary time hope that voice from across the house today and the voice of my constituent uplift and champion their friend and colleague and those who work in charity can at least bring ray of sunshine right now we can not fix everything overnight as the hon member for brent east say this be very long term project but we will get there we will keep cause little bit of trouble good trouble where we need to and we will do everything we can to ensure equality recognise that we have more in common and make the difference that really be need be always very pleased to speak in this house during black history month say that not out of ceremony but out of conviction believe that it matter for black britons watch today to see this parliament take time to reflect on our history our struggle and our contribution it matter that our story be not confine to footnote or commemorative month but recognise as part of the very fabric of british history each october believe this debate should be on the order paper as matter of course yet too often it have be absent or dependent on the will of few determined member let thank all those involve in ensure that this debate take place during government time many of my colleague will rightly use this opportunity to honour the giant of black british history the leader thinker and ordinary people who achieve extraordinary thing often in the face of unimaginable obstacle pay tribute to they all but today want to use my time differently want to speak frankly about why decade after the civil right movement and year after black life matter bring million to the street we still have not tackle racism in this country and beyond want to say plainly that we have not tackle racism because we have not fully commit to repair the inequality we have part in create we have not commit to reparatory justice in after the murder of george floyd more than people sign petition call on the government to include britain role in colonialism and enslavement in the national curriculum it become one of the most sign petition ever submit to parliament and that moment feel like turning point sit in the debate that follow remember the sense of hope that at last we would be honest about our past honest about the empire that build britain wealth and honest about the life it destroy because hundred of thousand of british people want it yet five year on and year after black history month be found in the uk very little have change britain colonial past be still treat as an optional topic not foundational one black british history be still squeeze into one month and often teach only by those teacher who go above and beyond use their own time and resource many young people grow up learn in history lot about our monarchy but not about our empire the history of our monarchy be important it speak of how our country come to be some might be surprised to hear that be fan of the odd period drama those story be very interesting but it have to be wrong that some never hear about queen nanny of the maroons mary prince olaudah equiano the bristol bus boycott or even the role of the british state in the enslavement of million that speak to the fact that our country do not want to engage with these issue young people be teach about industrial innovation but not about who pay the human cost for that progress that cherry picking of what to teach point to something more worrying because we also miss out on learn about other working class struggle such as the miner strike and the suffragette those story that educate we on the power we hold as citizen and the thing people have do to challenge injustice we can not say that this nation be face its history when it still refuse to teach it fully we have talk lot about patriotism recently let be clear do not believe that patriotism be about pretend that our history be glorious and benign patriotism be about be honest enough to confront the truth because only nation unafraid of the truth can hope to build just future believe that in order to stand firm in pride and power as the theme of this black history month ask we must address these issue because where be the pride in not recognise you be wrong and where be the power in not tackle global injustice that have fail to be repair last night have the honour of deliver the national union of journalists claudia jones memorial lecture claudia jones the journalist activist and mother of the notting hill carnival teach we something very powerful she teach we that the struggle against racism can never be separate from the struggle against imperialism she write imperialism be the root cause of racism it be the ideology which uphold colonial rule and exploitation that be not just historical observation it be diagnosis of the present when far right politic rise across europe when migrant be scapegoate and when global inequality widen claudia jones word feel prophetic she understand that racism at its root be not about personal prejudice or isolate ignorance too often we try to reduce it to the few bad apple argument racism be structural it be the operate system of an economic and political order build through empire that exist today it be the logic that justify and still justify steal land steal labour and steal wealth it be the logic that say that some people be disposable so that other might prosper racism do not appear by accident it have no factual basis racism be engineer that be why say that we can not dismantle racism without repair if racism be build into the economic foundation of this country in land in labour and in capital then the remedy must also be material we can not tackle problem without get to its root it be not enough for we to express deep regret and other platitude it be not enough for we to change few name and statue and call it progress we must repair the harm structurally economically culturally and politically that be the very heart of the global movement for reparation this year the all party parliamentary group for afrikan reparation which chair host the third annual uk reparation conference we see hundred of activist scholar lawyer and community leader come together from across the world and the message be clear the demand for repair be no long fringe issue it be moral and political necessity and yet in britain we still refuse to apologise for our role in enslavement and colonialism we refuse to return steal artefact we even refuse to return human remain deny dignity even in death we refuse to engage meaningfully with reparatory justice even last year when the commonwealth nation call for mere discussion on reparatory justice we say no what do that sound like give the history of the commonwealth our country have not apologise it have not repair and it have not make amend but the tide be turn and young people be ask the right question institution be begin to confront their own archive the debate can no long be bury or delay we have to be clear that reparation be not only about money how could they possibly be if people think the call for reparation be call for cash they have not be listen how can it be what amount of money could ever really compensate for what happen which be one of the great crime in human history enslavement traffic genocide ecocide widespread theft and everything in between reparation be about truth restitution and transform relationship between nation between community and between the past and the present reparation be about acknowledge that britain become one of the rich nation on earth not just through industry and ingenuity but through the extraction of human life and labour from africa the caribbean asia and beyond when enslavement be abolish it be not the formerly enslave who receive compensation it be the enslaver they be pay the modern equivalent of billion of pound for the loss of human property british taxpayer include black britons finish pay off that debt in that be not distant history it be the present it be certainly the present in my taxpaye history meanwhile the descendant of those who endure generation of force labour receive nothing to this day not even an apology their name be often erase from the story of their own liberation freedom have be parade as gift when talk about reparation the descendant of enslave and colonise people be often tell that should be grateful that britain abolish the slave trade be proud of the role that this country my country play in the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade but that alone can not be absolution be sorry but can not see how just because an arsonist feel guilty we would absolve they for start the fire in the first place the injustice speak of do not end with that emancipation it continue through colonial rule through the berlin conference that carve up africa without single african present through artificial border and economic dependency and through the extraction of resource that continue to this day it mean that at the un in african nation still have to get up and ask to be include in the un security council despite the fact that african and caribbean nation make up the majority of the country in the world when people ask why reparation ask in return why do we ever think that freedom without repair be enough or that it be freedom at all in this parliament be proud to be part of the legacy of the late great bernie grant who stand in this very chamber and call for reparation when few dare to without truth there can be no justice without justice there can be no healing that be why the all party parliamentary group believe we need commission for truth and reparatory justice the commission would not simply investigate the past it would examine how legacy of that past be alive in the present in the racial wealth gap health inequality educational disparity and the policing of black community none of these pattern be accidental they be build and because they be build they can and must be dismantle but that will happen only if we have the political courage to do so to do it we have to move away from this lazy reductionist style of politic which often talk about what we can not do instead of talk about what we can do every major institution in this country bank university the monarchy museum carry trace of wealth extract through colonialism and enslavement the evidence be in the bank ledger and shipping record and in the foundation of building across this city that history do not belong in footnote it belong in how we shape our policy today no individual group need permission to demand justice the call for reparation be ground in international law in human right and in the moral truth that those who profit from crime against humanity have duty to repair they this be not about guilt or unpick the past as have be accuse of do previously it be about responsibility it be about not division but healing however healing can not begin when the truth have not be tell that be why the teaching of black history as british history be in itself reparatory if we be serious about tackle racism we have to be serious about this repair racism be about not just word or attitude but material condition who own wealth who hold power and who have access to housing healthcare safety and dignity racism persist because the harm have never be repair the call for reparation have survive century because it speak to something beyond politic it speak to the human need for recognition justice and dignity and to the possibility of renewal not just for the nation that be wrong but for britain itself because black britons be part of that story could be the rich person in this country and rise to the high office in this land but understand that will never escape racism by its very nature until there be justice for every single person who look like nothing will change in that regard now the world be change and our place in it be precarious if we do not change our attitude which still feel root in empire want our country my country to be look on with respect and admiration not because it never get anything wrong but because we have the courage to put what we get wrong right hon member may be wonder about my jacket today and the truth frankly be that be tired of be upstage by the thread of my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler however this jacket be also symbol of my identity get it when go to zambia in july in my role as trade envoy to southern africa the fabric be what we call chitenge and it be the same kind of material that my mother and indeed her mother joesphine hambelele nakun tunga wrap in at birth that visit be important to because be proud of my heritage but my home be here in london that be my identity be british zambian that be my story last friday visit centrepoint in my constituency and have great conversation about opportunity for young people one conversation with young woman have stick in my mind because of what she say which be be black british that be who be and want you to know both of those thing why be that such an important thing to say for it be about what we be proud of it be about freedom democracy and the rule of law we must remember that those idea be first write into the story of this nation on the field of runnymede in magna carta lay down the truth that still bind we that no one not even the most powerful be above the law those be the foundation on which our democracy be build the freedom from which so many nation such as the united states derive their own and the freedom that underpin the very concept of free world they be the principle of democracy for which our country fight in the face of fascism and nazi germany in this nation fine hour our great generation yet stand quietly above those meadow look down on the birthplace of liberty be another monument the commonwealth air forces memorial which bear the name of more than man and woman who have no know grave above the place where freedom be first sign into existence stand memorial recording the name of those who give their life to defend it when lead the royal air force ethnic minority network we use to visit the memorial every year we would walk among those name black brown christian muslim sikh hindu from across the commonwealth remember the people who come not as visitor but as defender of britain stand shoulder to shoulder against fascism and tyranny among they be noor inayat khan british indian woman raise in london who train as wireless operator in the royal air force and work for the special operations executive she be capture torture and execute in dachau for refuse to betray her comrade her final word be the cry of liberté or freedom the same freedom sign into be below her memorial on the field of runnymede her life and her death complete that circle from the parchment that promise liberty to all people to the courage she display in preserve it though his name be not carve on the wall of runnymede flight lieutenant johnny smythe stand in that same lineage of service sacrifice and selflessness sierra leonean who fly with the royal air force he be shoot down and hold in prisoner of war camp yet when he return to britain he choose not to turn away but to help to rebuild it work in the colonial office it be smythe who conceive the idea of recall troopship the empire windrush troopship fill with our veteran who have fight for our freedom who we know as the pilots of the caribbean back to our shore full of servicemen and nurse that act give birth to new chapter of our shared history so when hon member hear the word you call and we come let we remember that it be not the voice of white official but the voice of sierra leonean man black british man and raf officer who have already fight for his country freedom that be how deeply black history run within not beside british history this be how we counter division and exploitation this be how we undo the false narrative and understanding of our history and our british identity that cause the windrush scandal and that be enable our enemy the enemy of freedom equality and british value to mobilise today because we be now see those thing regularly online on our street and in part of our medium frankly that we would have never see few short year ago we be see vicious hate speech and open racism racist be speak out with not only impunity but the sense that they speak for the spirit of the moment and we must be clear that they do not that be what we be fight against but what be we fight for think we can see positive narrative emerge in our community want to give an example from south woodford where the community come together after sequence of event that cause real fear in our community and across leyton and wanstead after the racism and extremist violence we see during tommy robinson march last month the appalling antisemitic attack in manchester the firebombing of the mosque in peacehaven and the calculated vandalism design to intimidate include the flag raise on the viaduct across from the south woodford islamic centre we be bring together by councillor joe hehir dr fahim from the islamic centre rabbi richard jacobi from east london and essex liberal synagogue and reverend dr elizabeth lowson from st mary parish church woodford dr fahim unite we with his word but they be also the word of the broad community and the leadership of south woodford society include pearl louise rena and her excellent tea must say elaine atkins mbe and andy pike their simple message be love south woodford hate racism here be what think we can do next we will raise our flag we will celebrate our synagogue our mosque our church and our community in south woodford we will gather together as community and talk about our history under our flag we will do that across the constituency and celebrate with pride all the people in our community regardless of where they come from we will celebrate with other migrant like and our beloved okan aslan who next week will also identify as be british if we be serious about tackle hatred and stand up to those who would tell we that this be not our land then we must ensure that these story be not confine to single month or to those who already know they like the story of noor inayat khan and johnny smythe and the people like who have come after they must be own by and teach to and by we all when every child in this country know that our history be all of our history we will not defeat the far right we will remove the ignorance that fuel and create it ultimately we need to do that otherwise we can not defeat it we be not yet in the same place that noor inayat khan and johnny smythe be we need to defeat the want ignorance and fear from which hate be draw we need to prevent malign actor from exploit anger and alienation and the evil that create they black history black british history be our great weapon in do so my remark will be influence by my membership of the health and social care committee and by the fact that be the vice chair of the all party parliamentary group on black health also like my hon friend the member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey have the pleasure of be trade envoy for morocco and francophone west africa we share great interest in that continent will focus my remark on health when we talk about health and black people very often we talk about the huge improvement in recognition of one outstanding person mary seacole who be now just talk about as nurse who do wonderful thing in the crimea she have reach the august stage of not just be refer to as the black florence nightingale she be now refer to in her own right but it take an immensely long time for that to happen the hon member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies and for aberdeen north kirsty blackman refer to the contribution make by the windrush generation the history of the national health service and of our country black community be intertwine the people who come on windrush and other boat and the successor to they be now retire and be serve by the national health service but the people who come after they be still the bedrock of the national health service they provide the majority of the care that we all expect to receive but we know that their contribution have not always be well reward there be still huge issue today regard how well the national health service serve people of colour how well it serve black people that be bring home to quite starkly by one of the most challenging thing that have confront any of we in our recent history the covid pandemic as cabinet member for health and social care in london council at the time would see the vaccination figure every week among people of different socioeconomic background consistently people from an african caribbean background would be the least likely to be vaccinate they would be the most reluctant lot of people be say thing like oh this be just because they be prey to misinformation or have irrational fear all we need to do be put they in front of people of religion or footballer and it will change everyone mind find that slightly odd so talk lot to people to try to understand why it be happen should say that go to london comprehensive school with people who be black white and from all sort of background have always be aware of racism but think that thing have get lot well from talk to black people about covid and their feeling about the nhs realise that thing be really not as good as have like to pretend to myself the situation be not drive by need to educate people or make they aware the problem be that there be lack of trust in the nhs and it do not come from nowhere if people consistently get less good access to care less good treatment and less good outcome it be not surprising that when they be tell trust we we the nhs they say well you have always obviously have my good interest at heart so forgive certain amount of reluctance to do so we have very serious problem in our country of people get less good healthcare simply because their skin colour be different which be completely absurd it sound very childish of to put it in that way as it be so ridiculous and what see during that time on the council make think how do we address it how do we create the trust that we need everybody in this country to have equally in the nhs our select committee be try to grapple with those question in different way the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman mention the issue of black maternal health she be right that maternal health service be huge problem the health and social care committee recently undertake an inquiry into how to improve black maternal health service will talk little bit about it because think what we come out with provide bit of road map for transform the nhs treatment of black people across the board and for improve service across the board we start by confront the shocking fact that black woman be time more likely than white woman to die during pregnancy or childbirth or in the post natal period as slight aside the figure use to be even bad it use to be almost five time it have only get well because everything have get bad for white people as well there be huge problem in maternity service in this country generally but the disparity still remain black woman be time more likely to die than white woman in in one of the rich country in the world we hear repeatedly that the disparity be not the result of social factor biology or other thing it be simply racism it be not direct not overt not think through but racism be one of the core driver of the disparity the statistic that black woman be time more likely to die than white woman be not just statistic because behind every number be woman who do not come home to her family child leave to grow up without their mother and partner parent or friend leave devastate by death that be preventable we be encourage to be optimistic so want to be optimistic against that stark background think thing can improve if we want they to improve the committee make number of recommendation on maternity care they be specific but as say think they have some universal application will share they and suggest how each can apply to the nhs more broadly to tackle racism so that everyone get equal care no matter who they be first we hear some really strange thing for example we hear evidence about black woman be tell by both black and white doctor oh well you black you can cope with more pain ca you it be incredible that people be still have that say to they other problem include symptom not necessarily be identify thing like skin rash and pre eclampsia discolouration because doctor and nurse be not properly train to understand the difference in skin colour and how to recognise these problem in black people as oppose to white people the committee simply think that it would be useful if we have mandatory anti racism training that be not train against be racist it be training in cultural competency understand difference they could be colour difference or cultural difference and respect all patient not just some surely it be the job and the fundamental duty of anyone in public service to be there for everybody not just some people we would like the training to be not just mandatory but inform by live experience not by assumption at the time some people say to let just get people in front of churchman and churchwoman and then they take the covid vaccine it must not be those sort of assumption we must actually listen to people and understand their live experience in order to tackle unconscious bias and racist assumption the good news be that there be model for this that work last night be at really interesting presentation by the caribbean african health network on something call the black health improvement programme it be commission by the greater manchester health and social care partnership to address the health inequality that be expose by the covid pandemic and it be now operate in greater manchester and enfield it offer gps culturally appropriate education and training inform directly by talk to the community it cover institutional racism health inequality and live experience and it be ground in reality we need to look at that and learn from it we must scale up such programme for use across the whole nhs the hon member speak very powerfully and knowledgeably in particular about maternity service note with interest the maternity service review be kick off by the government at the moment do the hon member agree that many of the change he be suggest could be implement right now and that we do not need to wait for the outcome of that review before we get start the hon member make very good point will run through few more proposal from the maternity report but they will not surprise member they be not radical or new what would really be radical and new would be if one of these report think have read at least six report about black people get less good treatment from the nhs have their recommendation implement that would be radical we on the health and social care committee be look forward to the government response to the report and be hop to see the recommendation implement if they be implement for maternity care we hope that they can be apply more broadly the maternity service development fund have sadly be slash from million to million the money have be give to integrate care board to parcel out but they be all face admin cut so maternity service will have to compete with every other local priority we need dedicated ringfenced budget and we need budget for area where there be specific racial health inequality such as condition that affect some people more than other because they be black be think of fibroid for instance and sickle cell awareness which will come to in minute turn to another thing that be essential in the nhs the health and social care committee be glad to have the new chair of the nhs dr penny dash in front of we be interview before her appointment she say that one thing that be really important to she be datum datum datum and agree however the extraordinary thing be that ethnicity data collection in the nhs be not very good but it be not impossible to do there be some work do on assess disparity in maternal morbidity outcome it be almost complete in march under the previous government but when the committee ask ministers in june how it be go we be tell that it be good news and that it be still be develop and be expect within less than three year that mean it will have take potentially six year to complete something that be mean to be almost finish this be very slow and unacceptable progress be pleased to hear the hon member highlight some good practice as parent you get slightly obsessive about your child health and tend to google what be go on with they the nhs website have improve monumentally over the year for instance when it come to rash it say rashes will present differently on black and brown skin and it show picture of how that might look be glad that the hon member highlight good practice do he think it be possible to lift and shift the good practice we see such as on the nhs uk website and with the greater manchester example he mention and do that across the board absolutely think the hon member and be advocate the same thing have to say quick plug here that the nhs app be quite good if anyone do not have it would sign up and get it if people do not get it and give feedback we can not make it any well be quite impressed by the app be shocked to see how many time have be to the doctor in recent year but all the information be there one way to achieve what the hon member for aberdeen north and want to achieve be by collect well datum on what be go on we need mandatory data collection we need to look at death near miss and complication we need to report disparity and take action when they be reveal we also need people to be accountable for take action we could look at whole range of area to see the disparity and difference that exist in treatment and outcome between black and white people we could look at cancer diagnosis timing and survival and mental health sectioning and treatment which be huge issue we could look at pain management analgesic prescribing referral rate to specialist treatment escalation decision patient satisfaction and how we measure that and complaint pattern we need datum on all these area so that we can address the issue and take action then we need to look at the workforce the government be come out with workforce plan later this year which be hugely need there be shortage in the force in some part of the nhs in particular maternity service but the workforce issue be not just about number it be about have staff who understand and respect patient and this come back to the cultural issue it be difficult enough for woman be patronise as patient but it be even more difficult for black woman sadly my experience as consultant in rural part of england be that shockingly some patient be still reluctant to see black doctor and nurse although my hon friend be talk about the experience of patient think we also must consider the attitude of patient towards our staff and the way in which staff be treat by some patient my hon friend make strong point and could not agree more there be some datum out there hospital trust collect datum each year on how their staff be feel about whole range of thing look at my local hospital trust datum and one question it ask be do you feel that you have suffer more discrimination this year from patient and from colleague and manager have not look for couple of year but sadly the last time look it be get slowly bad this be definitely an issue if people be foolish enough to think that somebody skin colour be go to affect their ability to do their job properly it make it more difficult for staff to provide care to the whole population black nhs staff need to have safe work environment they encounter racism and they should not it be interesting that you talk about doctor order the hon member mean he not you be most grateful for the correction madam deputy speaker it be interesting that my hon friend talk about doctor because honestly there be not that many people in leadership position in the nhs who be black and that be another issue that need to be address have use the word we all have in way that be perhaps not easy to do everywhere have to say when first start become aware of the huge difference there be in how people be likely to experience health service depend on whether they be black or white do not feel at all comfortable use the word racism sometimes when people say structural racism when talk about racism people will say be not racist but that be not what be be talk about so it be very difficult to enter this conversation remember when be on the council be once on big zoom call with people to discuss the inequality work we be do black woman talk lot about micro aggression and ask she when you be talk about micro aggression be you talk about racism she answer yes yes but you can say that can so think it be incumbent on people like white middle class gentleman of certain age to be ally as many hon friend and hon member here be be and to stand up and talk about these thing and name they for what they be we can effect change we can do the radical thing of implement the change that be need but to do that we need to have leadership that want to actually effect the change we have find sadly that black woman face poor outcome be shape by systemic failing in leadership and accountability as well as in training and data collection we need senior leader to be hold accountable for racial health inequality that mean that they need to be aware of they which mean they need the datum we need care quality commission inspection to specifically assess equity in care delivery trust board should be specifically responsible for monitor and address disparity and performance metric should include equity indicator that all sound terribly onerous but it be not it can become part of the normal way of do thing it just have to be introduce at some point as say these be not radical suggestion but to do they would be radical indeed the really radical thing to do this come out of the committee be just to listen properly to the woman need maternity service see terrible programme during covid where woman be talk about her daughter who be and have go to see her doctor she be talk about be in immense pain the doctor say well black woman have differently shape cervix so that be probably why she die in childbirth that sort of thing happen all the time we just do not talk about it all the time it have to stop we need to listen to black patient black patient talk to we say have pain report pain and report symptom just be believe their concern be dismiss that pattern appear not just in maternal health service but right across healthcare my hon friend be make powerful speech it be important to highlight the simple thing like listen to people but we must also get over our inherent reluctance to speak about health inequity when we be speak to each other prostate cancer for example affect one in four black man whereas it impact one in eight white man partly because we do not discuss the fact that it be more prevalent in black man and we need to conduct diagnosis much early do he agree that if you be black man or you have history of prostate cancer in your family you should go and get prostate prostate specific antigen test as early as possible as early as will not make reference to my own age or the fact that have have test myself be grateful to my hon friend my youthful friend for that comment could not agree more when become aware of this problem back when be councillor we institute programme to build trust within the black and minority ethnic community in the nhs as result we have hundred of conversation in the community with people from the nhs and with people of colour one black gentleman who think be little old than he be probably not far from my own age go and have prostate test as result and it be find that he have prostate cancer if he have not have the test who know what the situation would be these day therefore fully support my hon friend call for everybody to have prostate cancer test have have one myself and fortunately like he think thing be all right when we get feedback from patient we need formal mechanism for register that it should not be do in the typical ad hoc amateur way and we need to co produce the change with the people we be actually mean to be there for also when people complain about discriminatory treatment we need to consider that seriously and the nhs need to respond in much more open hearted open handed and open minded way than be tell it often do the committee do the inquiry and come up with specific recommendation that affect black maternal health but think they spread right across the piece of black people not get as good healthcare as they should and as white people do end on specific example of something quite close to my heart because of friend sickle cell disease as we be talk about black history would like to pay tribute to dame elizabeth anionwu wonderful woman and the uk first sickle cell nurse she have do so much to educate and other people and improve service in this country people may not know much about sickle cell if they be not black it cause intense pain and organ damage crudely cell get shape like sickle and it can cause stroke it can even cause early death it be often overlook mainly because it affect black and minority ethnic people imperial college healthcare nhs trust be currently run wonderful programme that serve my constituent in chelsea and fulham it be one of only seven centre in the country pilot what be call renal haematology triage unit which be one of those sexy nhs title but it just mean if person suddenly get crisis and need to be see swiftly they do not have to wait for hour and hour in accident and emergency they can get swift pain relief that be vital for make sure that the problem do not get seriously dangerous seriously quickly go to visit it and talk to patient and staff it be terrific centre that have make huge difference to people life as they be able to go to work and look after their child more easily it be inspirational but sadly it be pilot in the normal world we do pilot we see if it work and if it do we try to find the funding long term often in the nhs it mean we have get bit of money leave over what can we do or it mean let do project for few year and call it pilot we need to keep the funding for those seven project across the country which be offer urgent swift pain relief for people with sickle cell after april that be one thing that be work on at the moment we have to show everybody that they matter equally we have to build trust so let we build trust let we acknowledge the harm that have be do and let we do the work on training comprehensive datum and workforce issue let we name racism and tackle it head on let we listen to black patient and ensure that service for condition such as sickle cell be as important to everybody as they be to just few we can not change history we can recognise it as my hon friend the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy who have just leave the chamber say but we can change the future we have the evidence and the recommendation we know what need to be do have not say anything new or anything that will have shock the house the only thing that be shocking be that there be often so little willpower to make the obvious and necessary change that be need will keep fight for that to happen and hope that everyone in the chamber will fight alongside it be an honour to speak in the debate be proud to be the son of an irish immigrant my dad richard come over to the uk with his family when he be young boy they be look for safe accommodation and pay work remember he sit down when be young boy and tell that his family when in search of those thing would often come across two notice no irish and no blacks to learn that at such young age and to understand that prejudice be so build into our society fire in desire to fight racism it also continue to shock because that be not the distant past but very recent indeed this black history month we celebrate the black man and black woman who shape britain history bournemouth too but we must also remember what many of they be force to endure be proud to represent bournemouth east bournemouth be young upstart we can compare it with christchurch which be year old and poole which be year old that be really build from scratch only about year ago it be make by people who come from london and the home county it be and have always be melting pot and it be proud of that it be beautiful place to live work and be and be proud that it be such an inclusive place because bournemouth be such young town black history be build into what bournemouth have be think of thomas lewis johnson who be bear into slavery in virginia in and experience slavery full brutality physical punishment harsh labour the denial of basic human right and the mental trauma that will have go with all that but eventually he find his freedom he become minister and travel the world preach hope and equality in the he make boscombe in bournemouth his home and he name his house liberia in tribute to african independence he become british citizen in and support by local community who recognise his courage be able to do such thing as write his autobiography twenty eight years slave in bournemouth it tell story of faith resilience and humanity in it he write though my body be confine my spirit remain free and it be faith that guide through the dark hour be also think about lilian bader who break barrier of her own decade later when racial discrimination keep people of caribbean heritage out of the armed force she refuse to accept it in she become the first black woman to serve in the royal air force training as an instrument repairer and rise to act corporal after the war she earn degree become teacher and settle in bournemouth with her family and that legacy of service continue through her son she say father serve in the first world war his three child serve in the second world war marry coloured man who be in the second world war as be his brother who be decorate for bravery in burma their father also serve in the first world war our son be helicopter pilot he serve in northern ireland so all in all think we ve give back more to this country than we ve receive that legacy of service and that history that black history be british history and it be bournemouth history their contribution call we to keep on build town and country where everyone contribution be see value and celebrate want to pick up on point make by my hon friend the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy it be absurd that we cram black history into month and that we do not have requirement for it to be teach in our curriculum we rely on teacher who be already frazzle by their heavy workload and who have be look for light at the end of the tunnel for so many year to do the research and to find the resource and time to teach black history as well as other history such as that of the civil right campaign that lead to the disability discrimination act the history of gender equality and history we need to entrench the struggle of our country in the teaching of our curriculum so that the child we raise know fully as citizen what our country have be through and what its story will be that be particularly true because unfortunately those contribution be be erase nobody in bournemouth should feel uncomfortable unsafe or undervalue yet know all too well just how many black and asian member of my community have feel target and exclude be think of recent surgery appointment young black medical professional come and talk about his desire to live in britain all his life he say he would finish his shift and on leave the hospital he would have to look over his shoulder because he be concerned about be attack hear the same story from an employee at bournemouth university also think of an email that receive recently from the mum of lovely young lad know in bournemouth call dan the message say lot of we out here silently vibrate on an axis of vigilance anxiety powerlessness anger wonder when the violence will touch we and our loved one that woman describe herself as london exile she move to bournemouth for well life and more tolerant society and now in this day and age she be worried about her young boy have to experience the violence that she flee when she leave london she say that in london she see the british national party rampage in the street where she live and she worry that be come to bournemouth it should be no surprise and no shock that as their member of parliament will say that black life matter before it be political movement or social organisation it be statement of fact and it remain one black life be important yet some in their action and word seek to cast doubt on that truth my hon friend be make powerful speech he have mention people who have come to this country and contribute greatly as he and other members have say the problem we face be one that we do not think we would see in this day and age only last week post photograph of myself out door knock and speak to constituent and somebody post another foreigner represent wolverhampton grow up be racially attack include physically because wear turban and because of the colour of my skin but even so the comment shock because do not expect to hear it in present time when be think of how would respond to that person wonder whether should point out that of nhs worker be not bear in this country as be formulate response somebody respond well why do you stand at the next general election think that that be really good way of counter the comment do my hon friend agree that we have to face these issue and that we need ally people who be not black to take part in black history month that be how we will tackle the racism that people like still feel anybody in public service will feel vulnerable so we need as many people as possible to take part in this movement and in the celebration of black history month find my hon friend word very move and appreciate his testimony that will have be hard to share in the chamber but it be so important that he do and be sorry that he be go through those experience agree with he entirely sometimes hesitate to contribute to these debate because do not want to take time from colleague who have first hand direct experience of what it be like as black person but my hon friend have pick up on really important point allyship at this time be crucial will do everything can to stand up for both my hon friend and the black people represent and know that colleague in this chamber will do exactly the same we must stand against racism on that point it concern deeply that we have have summer of such discontent which promise to be long period of unfortunate hatred fly the flag should unite we not divide we one of my early memory be see linford christie drape the union flag around himself after win the olympic gold in it be wonderful moment yet at present there be people whose intention in fly the national flag be to exclude when the intention behind fly the flag be to cheer on our national sport team it bring pride and belong it create the joy and happiness that our country strive for but when the intention be so deliberately to intimidate and so consciously to exclude some people in my town of bournemouth and across our country it can only ever fuel the rise tide of racism that know we all in this chamber and across our country wish to reject it make no sense to indeed it feel not just wrong and unfair but illogical that in some case the flag be fly in celebration of black and asian footballer and in other situation it be fly to make their community feel unwelcome we should stop that we should come together we should unite as one country let we not merely honour black history month in word and speech perhaps with the announcement of statue and with further debate next year and the year after in which we commit to do thing let we take action let we build future in which equality be our share legacy say that particularly to my constituent in bournemouth because we have be rock by summer of discontent with frequent protest which seem to have coincide with many year of feeling lost and hopeless bournemouth be young town but over the course of its history it settle into who it be it be seaside town and people know what our industry and our sector be about in recent year with austerity and the loss of key employer the town have lose its way bit it be look to tell different story it be look to tell story of inclusion hope and happiness just as black history have always be key to bournemouth history the contribution of black boy girl man and woman will be key to bournemouth as it find its new story we will move forward together unite against racism and determine to build an equal fair and just society under one flag congratulate my hon friend the minister for equalities and the mother of the house my right hon friend the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott on their excellent speech as well as my hon friend the members for brent east dawn butler for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy for leyton and wanstead mr bailey and many other rather like my hon friend the member for bournemouth east tom hayes sometimes wonder about the appropriateness of speak in debate like this but be delighted that our comment be be accept in the spirit of allyship which be absolutely how they be intend want to celebrate this year black history month it be very relevant in my constituency of watford where there be an active and engage black community particularly pay tribute to the watford african caribbean association which be found by sam lusack randolph henry and althea mclean in make it one of the old such association in the country in fact there be lovely quote from althea on the waca website which will read because it be quite inspirational let we resolve to keep go regardless of the many challenge each one of we can do something and together we can achieve the association be now lead by clive saunders and it do amazing work for the community in the constituency include provide activity for the lot of support around sickle cell which my hon friend the member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman speak about and community help advice and engagement during covid it do great work as well we know that black and minority ethnic people be disproportionately impact by covid clive be typical representative of an excellent community organisation in that he be always delighted to see but he be jolly well go to hold to account when he do and we love he dearly for that should also like to pay tribute to the chair of watford borough council favour ezeifedi who be fellow councillor of mine for many year she have overcome adversity and persevere to achieve many great thing locally and do tremendous work to support young people especially through her church this year be the anniversary of nigerian independence and recently have the pleasure of attend one of several celebration hold in my constituency the generosity of the event organiser be remarkable and be really surprised to find one of my caseworker there with her father have not expect she to be present but she and her father have take their car to the garage opposite the venue for repair and while they be hang around the organiser ask whether they would like to join they in their celebration that be tremendous an for diary management for my caseworker would also like to put on the record my support for one vision in my constituency which be lead by enoch kanagaraj it have just win national award for its incredible health work with faith community it have deep link in the community as be touch on by my hon friend the member for chelsea and fulham many people be intimidate by go to an nhs setting to receive testing and treatment and so on but often they will go to their church one vision have do tremendous work in bring health and faith together to enable people to be test for diabetes for example also thank eva mbiru community activist who host spice in watford which support woman in the constituency we must also celebrate the legend that be luther blissett from watford football club have already give so much to watford over the year he and his partner lauren do incredible work to support the veteran community in my constituency it be pleasure to respond to the debate on behalf of my party thank hon member for their powerful important and wide range contribution it be clear that we share commitment across the house to recognise the achievement of black britons and to address the challenge that remain the commission on race and ethnic disparities conclude that britain be model as multi ethnic society with share national value and beacon to the rest of europe and the world that be not to ignore some of the issue that have be raise in the chamber but to acknowledge rightly our progress and potential if any country can continue to advance equality of opportunity for black people it be this one as have be mention the leader of the opposition be the first black woman to lead major political party in the uk as we have agree today black british history be powerful weapon to challenge racism tackle underachievement tackle inequality in health education and justice and ensure the economic opportunity that we want and desire for all our constituent that be draw out by member across the chamber turn to the contribution it be pleasure to be in this the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott because remember watch she on the telly on this week that be my favourite show and very much enjoy watch she it be pertinent and valuable that she draw out the importance of migrant who support our public service and the disparity and disadvantage in educational outcome that remain for too many black child the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman rightly raise the maternal health disparity to respond to the concern she raise that relate to my party tenure we do launch maternity disparity taskforce in february to explore inequality in maternity care in order vitally to improve outcome for woman it focus on disparity face by woman from ethnic minority and those live in deprive area who see lack of parity with other we launch million fund to tackle health inequality in maternity care as part of our woman health priority of to build consortium to deliver research which have be raise today and capacity over the next five year hope the minister will undertake to hold to account other department to ensure that that be build on be sure that she will take that opportunity after the debate especially as it have be mention by member across the chamber the hon member for brent east dawn butler who mention the fact that we co chair the all party parliamentary group on woman in parliament speak bravely and movingly again about the direct racism that she receive that be abhorrent unacceptable unwarranted and unbelievable in this day and age love the love myself affirmation think might start tell myself that in the mirror every morning maybe we should all do so if we need to get away from the kind of rot we get on social medium absolutely agree with the point she make about one particular party that be try to take people back to some kind of past and be offer mirage it need to pick side capitalist socialist or populist but it be not direction that want to go in the hon member also mention that there be no joy or energy in racism it be pure negativity she might know that love my music so be happy that dj love spoon might be able to make an appearance at her event the quote that she read about make some noise be exactly right the hon member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey be not in his place at the moment ahem oh sorry he have move how could miss he in that jacket talk about make some noise the hon member jacket have make splash in the chamber today he rightly speak about pride in be black and british and that be brilliant to hear the hon member and other speak about prostate cancer rate for black man the prostate cancer support organisation recently hold an event in my patch with the east grinstead and district lions club just last saturday more than man come to the meridian hall for the seventh annual event to get check sometimes it be in those less formal place that people can have conversation that tackle stigma and concern around health as we have hear from other member sometimes it be people like brian and his team start those conversation that give people the confidence to go to the nhs and other more formal structure that give the opportunity to gently but think rightly challenge the man and woman health strategy this be not just about waiting list it be about real intervention and change for people the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman mention the scottish word for cuddle the welsh word cwtsh be quite new one for she speak about everyday miracle think there be danger in all this negativity that we miss those everyday miracle in our constituency that be not to mention the miraculousness of dentistry over the decade over history and how vital those people have be to we the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman rightly spend much of his time reflect on the value of our select committees and of address the outcome for black people in the nhs urge he to work with his party on the issue of birth and woman health the government rightly say that they be commit to the woman health strategy again implore minister to remain committed to work together on that because we know what difference it can make the hon gentleman speak about be radical he say that be radical be about implementation they say that the first iteration of policy be operation so let we get this go so that it can really make change there be so many change in nhs england rightly we be all take forensic look at that but there be lack of interest in outcome for wales and lot of money be go in direction that we might not always be comfortable with so let we use this opportunity to challenge inequality the minister for equalities mention the ethnicity pay gap reporting it be vital that we fully understand the scrutiny and consider potential legislation know that for the hon member for brent east hope that can call she my hon friend this be so personal october be breast cancer awareness month and many of we will have be wear pink on various day and highlight event across parliament woman from all background need real advice we talk about stigma around prostate cancer and black man health but we also need to ensure that for woman there be conversation about breast health and breast cancer sadly we be still see poor breast cancer outcome for woman in ethnic minority community have brilliant symptom checker for every woman to use when be work with wellbeing of women on issue relate to the menopause for black woman it strike that the outcome and workplace experience be still too wide ranging this be great opportunity to raise those issue the hon member for bournemouth east tom hayes mention no blacks no irish sign my dad be the main contractor for brighton and hove council in the and and he employ many irish people in fact think that most people speak with an irish accent it be quite surprise to grow up that there be sussex accent which be remarkably different remember those day of auf wiedersehen pet and so on the hon gentleman be absolutely right that be real experience for family and it shape people thank he for share that the hon member for watford matt turmaine highlight local organisation trust and the approach of church that be important the hope church in east grinstead do great work in my patch particularly on job search and help man in particular not to feel alone to conclude let we work with energy in black history month to boost real opportunity across society and produce real outcome real change and real understanding say that mp stand not for member of parliament but for most persistent because our job be to stand up for the voiceless we must confront racism and make direct difference by be true to the theme of this black history month which be standing firm in power and pride and through our strength resilience and leadership in this house and across our community we will see real change that change lie in all our hand and will happen by we work together to wind up for the government on her first outing as minister call taiwo owatemi it be an honour to speak in today debate we have celebrate year of change and we have speak honestly about the range of challenge face and to be overcome as we go forward before respond to some of the point raise today would like to pay tribute to those who make up the most diverse parliament ever when the race relations act be pass in parliament look very different there be zero ethnic minority mps and few woman sit on these benches it be testament to how we have grow as nation that so many group be now represent in the house my grandmother could never have imagine that her granddaughter would one day speak from the front bench of the house of commons close debate on race and equality so it truly be an honour to be here with everyone today have listen intently and thank all right hon and hon member for their thoughtful and heartfelt contribution to this important debate one theme in particular have stand out the power of storytelling it be through story that we understand our past give meaning to our present and inspire other to build well future thank right hon and hon member from across the house for speak passionately about the theme of this black history month standing firm in power and pride and legacies of action understand year of change and challenge we have hear many story point to the importance of history and about crucial issue that would like to address the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott raise the windrush compensation scheme we recognise the importance of speed up the process and the role of the windrush commissioner in ensure the delivery of the compensation scheme since the end of august this year the government have pay over million to over applicant of applicant have receive final decision hon member raise maternal health an issue that as young black mother be very passionate about be glad to represent government who aim to tackle racial inequality for both woman and baby frankly it be indefensible that race should have any bearing on how we bring child into the world we have launch an independent investigation into nhs maternity and neonatal service to understand the systemic issue around why so many woman baby and family experience unacceptable care the investigation will deliver an interim recommendation by december and publish further finding by spring thank the minister for talk about health inequality in the black community do she agree that we need to look at how we use ai system so that we do not automate bias and discrimination through their use thank my hon friend for the point she rightly make it be essential that we look at the impact of ai when address health inequality tackle persistent health inequality be key aim of the government mission to ensure that the nhs be fit for the future we be determined to ensure that one health outcome be not determine by ethnicity or where one live thank my hon friend the member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman for the work he do on the health and social care committee along with my hon friend the member for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton sadly the issue of the workplace harassment and abuse of black and minority ethnic nhs worker be key issue raise by nhs leader know the government be work hard to address those challenge on the issue of reparation thank my hon friend the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy for her contribution and work the minister for equalities have number of valuable conversation during her visit to bristol yesterday about the need to ensure an honest conversation on the impact of our country past that also include discussion on the reparative future programme at the university of bristol which be look at systemic injustice relate to transatlantic slavery the entire house be concerned about the educational outcome of working class child in general but do the minister accept that if we only ever talk about white working class child black parent and black community may believe that their child be be ignore thank the right hon member for raise that point the government be look at how to address educational outcome for all group it be heartbreaking to hear from my hon friend the members for brent east dawn butler and for wolverhampton west warinder juss about their experience of racism racism be completely unacceptable and have no place in our society and any instance in which it occur must be treat with the utmost seriousness that be why we have strong legal framework in place to deal with the perpetrator of racist and other form of hate crime and we expect the perpetrator of this abhorrent offence to be bring to justice do the minister agree that not only do we need to be not racist but we need to be anti racist in order to tackle the situation in society right now absolutely we have to be proactive in speak out against racism in any area or situation in society in which we see it it be disappointing and concern to hear about of the police incident raise by my hon friend the member for brent east there be no space for racism in police or for intolerant policing one reason like the black history month debate be that it provide an opportunity to hear from member across the house about the wonderful trailblazer in their constituency in both the past and present it be wonderful to hear from the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman about her constituent bertha ify and jane about all the work they do and the contribution they be make to make aberdeen north well place for all it be also wonderful to hear from my hon friend the member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey about johnny and noor from my hon friend the member for bournemouth east tom hayes about lilian and her family legacy of service and from my hon friend the member for watford matt turmaine really hope he enjoy the good jollof rice in the world it be good to hear from he about the contribution from clive councillor favour and enoch from one vision we can not have black history month debate without recognise the trailblazer in this house the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington be the first black female mp and she pave the way for other young girl like myself always feel incredibly lucky to be able to sit on these benches with she something that never think would be able to achieve it be also wonderful for this year black history month debate to be chair by madam deputy speaker who be the first ethnic minority deputy speaker it would not be right of to speak about the contribution make by trailblazer in this house without mention our own serjeant at arm who be previously in the chamber he be the first black holder of his post in its history of over year he be appoint in and move to this country in the after be bear in nigeria in conclusion madam deputy speaker will the hon lady give way be happy to just want to say that most of the thing the hon lady have say from the dispatch box be brilliant and believe every word apart from that she be mother she look so young that may be outside of the scope of this debate minister you may wish to respond will take the compliment thank the shadow minister very much as this debate have make clear this nation have rich and proud history of break down barrier and opening door for everyone to thrive one that speak directly to this year black history month theme legacy of action this be our legacy and our action remain ongoing beyond the measure that my hon friend the minister for equalities and have set out today we should not be satisfied with where we be we still have long way to go our fight for equality be urgent and it continue there have always be those who seek to create division who do not wish to see community not just survive but thrive together they will tell we that incorporate different type of people into our nation be something new that have be force on we to they say this tell it to the black dockworker sailor and business owner of century liverpool and bristol who build community in the face of prejudice tell it to the windrush generation who help rebuild britain after the war and make this country home and tell it to the campaigner artist and leader of today who continue to drive change and enrich every part of our national life this be britain diverse determined and proud we have thrive because of that diversity and we would not be the nation we be without it let we tell those story and write new one story of black britons who have shape build and enrich this country that task be as vital now as it have ever be and with our first black president of the royal academy of dramatic art the great david harewood together with the brilliant cynthia erivo be sure that the future of our country storytelling be bright and bold finally thank all member not only for their powerful contribution to today debate but for the work they be do across the country throughout black history month later this week will be join by journalist trish adudu musician sandra godley obe and detective inspector andrew mitcham at the university of warwick help to break down barrier and open door to opportunity for the next generation know that many member be also mark black history month in their constituency share story championing change and help to build fair more inclusive britain for we all it be that energy dynamic enthusiasm and sincerity that give hope hope that the fight for equality will not only be continue but that it will one day be win well do question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider black history month decarbonisation of cement motion make and question propose that this house do now botterill cement may not grab headline but it quite literally hold up our country virtually every hospital school bridge and home be build use cement without thriving cement industry it will not be possible to deliver the renewal our nation need and the million home the government have commit to build derbyshire be the proud home of britain cement and lime industry this critical material have be make there for generation sustain family support our local economy and make the midland one of our country great industrial powerhouse today derbyshire and neighbouring staffordshire account for around of all the cement and lime produce in the uk and the industry support more than high quality and well pay job in our community however cement also produce significant carbon emission with around of all carbon emission globally come from cement more than come shipping and aviation combine to put that in scale in the uk cement produce more carbon emission than the entire city of birmingham we simply can not tackle the climate crisis safeguard our planet for future generation and deliver net zero economy without tackle this issue at the same time our uk cement industry face increase pressure with uk cement production now at its low level since and import cement make up an increase share of the market decarbonisation should never mean deindustrialisation and without action we risk lose high skilled job across the midland and the north and an industry that be vital to our nation it be therefore essential that we invest in new technology and make the uk and derbyshire in particular world lead producer of clean green cement many of these technological innovation be already be pioneer right here in britain for example cambridge electric cement have develop mean of recycle use concrete back into cement and the institution of structural engineers note that nine british base cement innovation be work to take capture carbon and store it within the concrete itself be also pleased to recently meet with coolbrook which be develop heater that will heat air up to without burn fossil fuel that would allow cement plant to replace the fuel use for burn with electric heating and reduce the amount of produce by between to encourage the government to do all they can to support those emerge technology and to use their research and development funding to ensure that such exciting innovation become commercially viable however even if we reduce emission from energy to zero two third of cement emission be the by product of the chemical process use to produce cement and these emission can not be cut without carbon capture and storage that mean that even if all the exciting development have mention succeed we can not achieve zero carbon cement without carbon capture and storage indeed the fact that carbon dioxide be create as part of the chemical process use to make cement mean that only carbon capture can eliminate the majority of emission from its production to be clear these project have nothing to do with prolong the use of fossil fuel it be entirely about ensure that we can safeguard this vital and important industry and protect the secure high quality unionised job that be root in local community such as the hope valley without carbon capture and storage we either have to stop produce cement or we fail to decarbonise neither be an option that we can afford that be why peak cluster be so important base in the hope valley it be the world large cement decarbonisation project with the potential to decarbonise of the uk cement and lime production under this project carbon produce in derbyshire through the production of cement will be capture and transport to morecambe net zero which will repurpose the morecambe bay gas field into permanent and secure carbon storage facility capable of store more than billion tonne of that be real example of how just transition can protect worker and community while reduce carbon emission this world lead innovation will also deliver major economic benefit for our country support more than job and attract around billion of private investment it also have the potential to remove more than million tonne of each year equivalent to quarter of all the emission create in derbyshire and staffordshire every single year that be why be delighted that in july the national wealth fund announce that it would make its first venture into carbon capture and invest million in peak cluster this historic step demonstrate how the national wealth fund can play major role in crowd in private investment and create the good clean job of the future it be estimate that every of public investment in the project will deliver of benefit this be an economic opportunity that we can not waste however the job be not do yet the investment from the national wealth fund be hugely welcome but it be only the start for the project to reach final investment decision and unlock billion of pound in private capital industry need one thing above all certainty at present there be no clear route to market for carbon capture and storage project beyond the track and track cluster without define framework for project like peak cluster private investor be leave in limbo which risk stall progress just when momentum be build we have see too many example in the past where project receive initial support from government only to stall because the next stage of policy never follow through this can not be another one of those case have two specific question for the minister first will he confirm that the government will establish clear route to market for industrial carbon capture project beyond track and track establish clear route to market would give investor and operator confidence that final investment decision on peak cluster and morecambe net zero will be make within this parliament the soon that be do the soon business will have the certainty need to invest and the soon all of we will benefit from the growth that such investment will deliver secondly will the minister commit to introduce contract for difference style model for carbon capture to ensure that project like peak cluster have the revenue certainty need to attract private capital contract for difference play key role in enable the widespread growth in renewable energy and can also play major role in support the growth of carbon capture technology however invest in clean cement here in the uk will be of no use if our builder import more polluting cement from abroad the amount of import cement have triple over the last year not only do import cement have high carbon footprint but the use of such cement undermine our british industry the government announcement that they will introduce carbon border adjustment mechanism be therefore very welcome news and demonstrate that this labour government will not allow our industrial industry to be offshore furthermore builder must also be incentivise to use clean green cement and this will only be do if there be clear incentive to do so it be therefore time for we to legislate to ensure that all development report on how much carbon be release through the production and use of construction material mandatory embody carbon reporting be need to drive down the emission release from construction mandatory reporting would provide consistency to the construction industry which must currently deal with patchwork of local regulation and reporting would also help stimulate the growth of low carbon building material only sufficient demand will enable low carbon technology to develop at scale and this demand can only be achieve through appropriate regulation the eu have plan to introduce mandatory embody carbon report from and to set project limit on embody carbon from when we leave the eu it be make clear that we would not reduce our environmental and climate standard and encourage the government to align with the eu the introduction of embody carbon requirement in the eu also mean that if we fail to decarbonise cement in the uk our cement industry could be lock out of such market as builder will be require to use only low carbon product in construction it be time once again to forge our future in the white heat of technology by act now we can safeguard our historic industry support our government mission for growth and deliver more sustainable and green world it be time to be ambitious and to back british industry it be after all desirable that the material that build britain be make in britain finish by return to peak cluster after all whatever other positive intervention we make simple chemistry mean that we can not cut the majority of emission from cement without carbon capture if we do not invest now we will simply kick this can down the road allow other country to move ahead of we and develop this emerge industry before we do today once again encourage the minister to invest in job british industry and decarbonisation that can be do only if we establish clear route for carbon capture project not include in track and track and encourage the minister to establish such route as quickly and urgently as possible call the minister see he be very ably support by edmund ward whom recall from my career history be so pleased that due to quirk in the timing we have almost two hour for the discussion of cement will endeavour to make the good use of the time available very much thank my hon friend the member for derbyshire dales john whitby for raise the issue of cement manufacture in the uk share his concern about the current level of cement production both for derbyshire and for the uk hope that by the time resume my place on the treasury bench he may feel certain sense of reassurance give the priority be personally give to this issue he make the case admirably for the cement sector base on the job and the impact on the local economy will endeavour to add to that economic argument by outline the importance of the cement sector to the uk more broadly breedon hope cement work in my hon friend constituency be the large in the uk it support job in his constituency and contribute million to the local economy in my role as minister for industry intend to be as vocal and visible an advocate of british industry as he be for the industry in his own constituency to be clear my objective as minister for industry be to ensure that we secure sustainable and prosperous future for this uk heavy industry before talk more broadly about the challenge of decarbonisation will briefly set out the role that the cement sector play in the uk cement be of course an incredibly ancient material which be develop and use extensively across europe by the romans however it would be wrong to think of it as material of the past it be subject to constant innovation as we hear from my hon friend if you will forgive for say so madam deputy speaker cement be quite literally the foundation of our modern economy it be the essential ingredient use to construct everything from home and hospital to bridge school road and energy infrastructure without cement there would be no new housing development or transport network that be why we recognise in our industrial strategy that the cement industry be an essential ingredient in our eight key growth drive sector and part of our foundation industry some of this government big and most ambitious delivery programme depend on the strength and durability of cement include our plan to build million home over the course of this parliament and the development of our clean energy infrastructure such as nuclear and offshore wind however it be also an economically important sector in its own right contribute million in gross value add and employ people in high skilled high wage job with wage premium above the national median wage and to above manufacturing benchmark indeed business in place where there be cement kiln be often the most highly productive with the most highly pay job my hon friend outline the challenge of decarbonisation and we need to find way for the uk cement industry to cut emission in the future he mention that it be very energy intensive energy and he rightly point out that the challenge in decarbonise cement be due to the calcination process in the manufacture of clinker have no extreme desire to turn the house into lecture theatre but it may be helpful to dwell for moment on the chemistry of cement production the process involve heat limestone to over to transform it into lime in and of itself this process release the carbon dioxide that have be trap in the limestone for millennia and two third of the emission be from the calcination process they be an inevitable by product of the cement production process and they can not be abate by fuel switching that problem be recognise few year ago by none other than bill gates we imagine that bill gates go to very exciting party in california but maybe they be not as exciting as we might think he say that when he be at barbecue with friend talk about decarbonisation as they often do his friend say to he bill decarbonise steel be very difficult and know that be true from my career he always say to they if you think decarbonise steel be difficult decarbonise cement be almost impossible this be challenge that even bill gates find it difficult to address however the uk have always be pioneer in overcome such challenge as we have hear many technology have be develop in the uk and will expand on those in moment the uk have be pioneer in cement too the invention of portland cement year ago by william aspdin spark construction boom that shape the country that we know today that be what we need to harness now innovation to face the challenge of decarbonisation will outline some of the progress that the industry and government be make there be essentially three opportunity for we in decarbonisation the first be reformulate cement so that it intrinsically have less carbon the second be reduction use less cement on each construction project there be number of way of do that the third which my hon friend describe extensively be carbon capture which be good place to start my hon friend speak of the peak cluster carbon capture utilisation and storage project which be partly locate in his constituency as he mention the project have be develop outside the government carbon capture usage and storage cluster sequencing process it be an important project that aim to store over million tonne of carbon dioxide from the cement and lime factory that support job across derbyshire staffordshire and the north west it could potentially decarbonise around half of our cement industry my hon friend mention the investment of million secure from the national wealth fund alongside million of private sector investment just this week meet not only the peak cluster team but sumitomo which be one of the large private sector investor in the propose pipeline look forward to further conversation with the peak cluster project to help bring this initiative to fruition he ask about contract for difference recognise that there could be role for contract for difference it be an area that would be prepared to look at more closely in future reformulation be about change the recipe for cement so that there be less embody cement in each tonne produce there be number of other cut edge project at various stage of development although none have be fully commercialise allude early to the historical role of cement again this be not an entirely new endeavour mention that the romans be particularly strong in the development of cement the pantheon in rome have marvellous dome over metre in diameter which be construct from three different formulation there be limestone in the heavy cement at the bottom and pumice stone at the top ultimately change the clinker that we use be at the heart of how we reduce carbon emission in cement will outline few project that be ongoing first of all there be material evolution mevocem green cement project it be work with global building material company crh and have pilot production facility in wrexham that use alkali fusion technology to produce cement at ambient temperature with no heat and use industrial by product reclinker formerly cambridge electric cement another project my hon friend mention use electric arc furnace slag and demolition waste to reduce clinker both project begin their experimental and pilot work at the materials processing institute madam deputy speaker if you refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests you will see that work there in the past have work on one of those project and support another there be also ecocem act or activate cementitious technology it be low clinker cement include limestone filler this take we back to that original initiative in ancient rome which be chemically activate to produce strong durable and low emission product today meet one of the company director when visit the amt laboratory in can town you may think madam deputy speaker that do nothing other than talk to people in the cement industry so interested be in this technology however it be not just the technology that we need we also need improvement in standard develop cement be no good if we can not use it and we can use it only if we have confidence in its application in the long term be pleased to learn that industry be work on this have develop flex standard which aim to be part of bs that should hopefully give insurer confidence and enable builder and designer to use some of these new material innovate uk as my hon friend mention have support many of these product in fact it have be overwhelm by application for new cement technology between the cement technology and the reduction in cement that mention we could reduce carbon dioxide emission per tonne and overall by around of course that leave residual amount for which carbon capture and storage either through pipeline or some other transport network would be require let we turn to the economic opportunity of cement the pioneering work have refer to be not just about cut emission and protect our environment we should not be blind to the huge economic opportunity in the uk consume just over million tonne of cement but we produce only million tonne ourselves the remainder around be import from primarily european country include france spain portugal and ireland this be quite new situation as it be usual for the uk to produce the cement that we need in our own economy cement be very heavy and it be expensive to transport see this as lost opportunity to capture additional economic value for the uk let put it this way if we produce domestically what we currently import we would need to increase production by half growth rate in the uk cement industry be conceivable it would mean around five additional cement plant in the country between they they would create around job and million in gross value add and would eliminate nearly half billion pound in the trade deficit on cement that we have in low carbon cement also open up new market opportunity the norwegian brevik cement plant be now operate with carbon capture it have sell out of its low carbon cement in and have grow order book recognise that there be an important role here for not just technology but people welcome the support of the institute of concrete technology and hope to be able to work with the institution of chemical engineers place very high value on the role that our professional institution can play in help people in our industry to transfer their skill across to new green technology turn to how the government be support the industry start by acknowledge that the previous government fail to recognise these opportunity they neglect our heavy industry by fail to invest in clean energy infrastructure they leave we dependent on fossil fuel and uniquely expose to high energy price which lead to bill crisis across society heavy industry include cement be neglect the previous government accept that decarbonisation mean de industrialisation this government do not through our industrial strategy we be take action to reduce industrial electricity price we be consult on uplift the network charge compensation scheme component of the british industry supercharger from to and we will publish response shortly the government will also introduce the british industrial competitiveness scheme from which will reduce electricity bill by up to for over eligible british business the government be also commit to deliver uk carbon border adjustment mechanism to tackle the risk of carbon leakage and we have publish draft legislation to enable we to deliver it by january that mechanism will ensure that highly trade carbon intensive product from overseas include product in the cement sector face comparable carbon price to uk good understand that it will give industry the confidence that it need to invest in the uk be ask today to ensure that the cement industry face level playing field and the carbon border adjustment mechanism will contribute to that know that my hon friend be also interested in emission reporting the government have just consult on an embody emission reporting framework which will simplify and harmonise exist private sector datum and instil more confidence in the datum that be be produce it aim to help producer with measuring report and verify the embodied emission of industrial product in more standardised and comparable way the objective of that be to remove information failure and support buyer in make informed purchasing decision the government be determined to mark departure from the de industrialisation of the past we know how vital heavy industry such as cement be to our economy to our most important building project and for thousand of well pay job across the country the prime minister himself have speak of our determination to renew britain through investment in new home infrastructure and public service that renewal will also mean re industrialisation of part of our country that suffer from factory closure and lack of investment under the previous government new age of industrial renewal have begin thank my hon friend for secure this debate and look forward to work with he and the cement industry on how we can secure investment and grow the industry in the future question put and agree to house adjourn
