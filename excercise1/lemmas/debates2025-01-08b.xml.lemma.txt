to ensure there be win win here we want ai developer to have the legal certainty that they need to develop their product in the uk as uk producer and for creative industry to know when their work be

addition to my duty in this house shall have further such meeting later today on behalf of everyone in southwark and hope the whole house offer the prime minister condolence on the loss of his brother over christmas and wish everyone happy new year last july the public overwhelmingly back labour manifesto commitment to halve violence against woman and girl can the prime minister set out how today vote on the child wellbee bill be crucial step to deliver that promise and protect child without the delay of an unnecessary further lengthy inquiry thank my hon friend and other colleague for their remark about my brother my hon friend raise very important issue violence against woman and girl abuse and child sexual exploitation be sicken and many victim have be let down for very long time by warped idea about community relation and the protection of institution he raise the question of inquiry there have be number of inquiry both national and local include one cover oldham reasonable people can agree or disagree on whether further inquiry be necessary this morning meet some of the victim and survivor of this scandal they be clear with that they want action now not the delay of further inquiry the jay inquiry the last national inquiry be seven year further inquiry would take we to action be what be require but whatever anyone view on whether further inquiry be need what find shocking be that anyone in this house would vote down the child wellbee bill this afternoon with vital protection for the most vulnerable in our society urge the leader of the opposition to withdraw her wreck amendment call the leader of the opposition the whole house have hear that the prime minister lose his brother during the christmas period so can offer he on behalf of my party our sincere condolence the new year have start with focus on the decade long rape gang scandal across the country thousand of girl be torture and sexually abuse at the hand of man who treat they as thing to be use and dispose of destroy many life forever the prime minister mention previous inquiry he be right there have be an inquiry into child sexual abuse but it be not about the rape gang scandal in its page it mention rotherham just once be the prime minister confident that we know the full extent of rape gang activity first thank the right hon lady for her condolence and thank she for reach out over the christmas period when lose my brother really do appreciate that and appreciate it today on the question of further inquiry there have be number of inquiry some of they localise include the mayor of manchester recent inquiry the national inquiry professor jay carry out take seven year it have recommendation none of which be actually implement by the conservative party when it be in government this be really serious issue and we must focus obviously on the victim and survivor there be no fixed view on the victim and survivor about further national inquiry there be mixed view but there be view and share this view that what be need now be action on what we already know we already know myself from personal knowledge when be chief prosecutor that warp idea myth and stereotype about victim be at the heart of this we have know that for decade the jay report call for mandatory reporting call for it year ago what we need now be action what can not be tolerate be the idea that this afternoon opposition members will vote down bill that protect let just say this one of the provision in that bill be to protect vulnerable child today who be out of school to prevent abuser from ever take those child out of school implore opposition member to defy the mislead leadership of the leader of the opposition and vote for really important bill be shocked that the prime minister would say that action be not take he know full well that we accept of the recommendation from the jay inquiry and go far launch gang taskforce which find more perpetrator that show that there be still work to be do in rotherham alone there have be more than victim across oldham bradford bristol rochdale and dozen more town there have be thousand more victim but no one have join the dot no one have the total picture and it be almost certainly still go on one victim from telford know the prime minister say that victim have different view we have different view across this house say that she want national inquiry because it will hold people accountable in way that previous inquiry have it be very possible to have action take on more and still have national inquiry why will the prime minister not listen to victim and launch national inquiry which would have the power to summon witness and make they give evidence under oath the right hon lady say that the last government accept the recommendation but they do not act on they one of the central recommendation be for mandatory reporting and it still have not be enact call for it year ago opposition members have be tweet and talk we have be act the leader of the opposition have be member of parliament for think eight year and her party be in government for seven and half of those eight year she be the children minister she be the women and equalities minister can not recall she once raise this issue in the house or once call for national inquiry it be only in recent day that she have jump on the bandwagon in fairness if be wrong about that and she have raise it invite she to say so now and will happily withdraw the remark that she have not raise it in the house in the eight year she have be here until today the prime minister be be very specific have raise this issue have raise it in speech and have raise it publicly the prime minister know that as minister would not have be speak on this specific issue because be not home office minister but let remind he about other victim who come to whom do help the victim of the tavistock scandal come to as minister and do not send they away like his safeguarding minister make sure as his labour party be call transphobic that we launch the cass review which even his health secretary have accept we do right by victim the reason why national inquiry be important be that this issue be systemic it involve local and national official the police prosecutor and politician the prime minister talk about some of the local inquiry but these interlinked issue can not be cover by local inquiry alone in fact the leader of the manchester inquiry resign because they could not get evidence they could not summon witness and not single person in position of authority have be hold to account the prime minister call for nine inquiry during the last parliament do he not see that resist this one mean that people will start to worry about cover up this be an important issue and we have to focus on the victim and survivor the lie misinformation and slinging of mud do not help they one bit the right hon lady raise victim question and quite rightly too accept that victim and survivor be in different place on this those have speak to be worried about the delay of further inquiry the last inquiry take seven year which would take we to among the issue that have be raise with the right hon lady have be speak to victim and they will have raise this with she be that it be very hard for victim and survivor to come forward to explain what have happen to they they do not want to be rush through this process which be why the last one take seven year it be not sensible to suggest that it can be do in hurry on the cheap and comprehensively that would take we to let we say or the victim have speak to want action today agree with they on that but what genuinely do not understand be why anybody would vote against the child wellbee bill which will protect child who be vulnerable today it will kill the bill it will stop the provision for child at risk today implore the opposition to vote for the bill do not wreck it in this misguided way it be very possible to have short inquiry especially if they cover area that have not be look at yet we do not need to repeat the work that have already be do let we look at new area former labour mp ann cryer say that there be councillor and mps all over the country who know what be go on but be terrify of be label racist national inquiry would ask if there be racial or cultural motivation behind some of these crime where white girl be see as jack straw say as easy meat the hon member for rotherham sarah champion be sack from labour front bench for speak out about rape gang do the prime minister now recognise that sack people for tell the truth create chilling effect that mean victim be not listen to be very happy to call out anybody who have not act properly in these case have do it many many time before and it do not matter to which political party they be in will call they out and will condemn they when be chief prosecutor take measure to confront this issue head on the first of the mass prosecution for an asian gang be in rochdale my team come to see and they put number of asian man in the dock they want the green light for the first of these case to take place give that green light but on one condition because it come to my attention that one of the man who be go into the dock have previously be arrest but not charge say you can bring the first of these mass prosecution but only if you look back at the we do not tell what go wrong in report so that can start to put it right that be what start the reform bring about that be the approach take in practice while other be tweet and talk it be the approach would take now in any case where there be wrongdoing here but what we have get to do now professor jay have say this we have have number of strong finding there be on the table from professor jay we have get to get on with action do not block it this afternoon we need to focus on what this be really about this be not about the prime minister work in the cps and would say very respectfully to the prime minister that it be not about you it be about the victim be leader not lawyer we know that people be scared to tell the truth because they think they would be call racist if we want to stop this from ever happen again we can not be afraid the labour party have adopt the appg definition of islamophobia the same appg report say that talk about sex groomer be an example of islamophobia this be exactly why people be scared to tell the truth and the lack of clarity mean that innocent british muslims be smear by association that be not fair and only national inquiry can solve this will the prime minister look again at the labour party adoption of the definition of islamophobia and its chilling effect and rule out introduce it in government will call out any aspect that have prevent anybody from come forward or any case from go forward when it come to violence against woman and girl child abuse or child sexual exploitation as have be do for the good part of year yes some people will say there should be further inquiry accept that but that mean all the victim and survivor who give evidence need to be in position to do so and not all of they be have be speak to they some think they be but it will take time all of the institution will have to give evidence that will take time this will delay thing until we already know what the major flaw be my argument be that we should get on with that action that be why we be bring forward the bill this afternoon the prime minister have effectively tell we that he be not able to do two thing at the same this issue of delay be weak excuse would say to he that by refuse this inquiry he be enable those people who wish to smear all british muslims base on the action of small minority he be talk about distraction tactic let we have the truth the prime minister can not tell the house the full scale of the scandal he do not want question ask of labour politician who may be complicit he will not he will not listen to the victim who be call for national inquiry he be make this all about this afternoon bill later today he will tell labour mps include those represent telford rochdale bristol derby aylesbury oldham bradford peterborough coventry middlesbrough newcastle and ramsgate to vote against national inquiry into the gang that have systematically gang rap child in their constituency this be one of the bad scandal in british order this be very very important issue that matter to the country it matter to all of our constituent and want to make sure they can hear what be be say by the leader of the opposition and the prime minister this be one of the bad scandal in recent british history how will labour members explain to their constituent that obey the prime minister whip be more important than do the right thing the right hon lady be right to say it be one of the bad scandal it be terrible that be why act on it she recently acquire view be that it be scandal have spend lot of time on social medium over christmas not once in eight year do she stand here and say what she have just say not once in eight year the previous government do not act on the recommendation they want national inquiry we have national inquiry the jay inquiry the report make recommendation not single one implement she talk about do two thing at once the conservatives can not kill the bill this afternoon wreck the bill and protect child everyone will remember the dreadful case of sara sharif this be the girl who be take out of school and abuse by an abuser this afternoon bill fix that gap be look across the house and know there be hon member on the opposition benches who know very well that what be in this bill be necessary that it be the right thing to do and would want to vote for the bill urge they to think twice about follow the short sighted misguided bandwagon jumping non leadership approach of the leader of the opposition my constituent annemarie like countless other armed force family across aldershot and farnborough be live in shabby military accommodation which after year of conservative neglect be simply not good enough therefore welcome the ministry of defence plan to buy back thousand of home in my constituency will the prime minister set out how sort out the bad deal leave by the tory government will make life well for annemarie and other like she live at the home of the british army thank my hon friend for her question we all owe an extraordinary debt of thank to those who serve by reacquire over service family home include in her constituency we can rapidly transform substandard accommodation the deal we have do also save the taxpayer around million per year in rent and follow the large pay rise for the armed force in over year there be of course still work to do but this be major step forward call the leader of the liberal democrats happy new year mr speaker join other in offer my personal condolence to the prime minister on the loss of his

we have increase the carer allowance we have set this up in stage so we can act and improve as we go along while make sure we have consensus for the big change that may be propose in the review invite he and member from across the house to work with we so we can get this right and ensure what we put in place endure beyond just few year if the government do not bring in long term social care reform this year their nhs reform in this parliament will fail so hope the prime minister will revisit the timetable move on while the hon member for clacton nigel farage may miss out on his big allowance from elon musk the spectre of the rich man in the world try to buy british political party should give we all pause for thought after year of the conservatives take million of pound of russian money will the prime minister now work with we to bring in long overdue reform to party funding so that power in this country lie with the voter not wealthy overseas oligarch think we all have smile on sunday when the hon member for clacton nigel farage say how cool it be to have the support of musk only for musk to say he should be remove just few hour later that be the rough and tough of politic of course we be look at the question of funding more generally welcome the effort this labour government have make to reset our relationship with the european union and to seek to remove unnecessary

criminal justice system too many of my constituent be victim of violence theft and antisocial behaviour and those crime too often go unpunished know the prime minister have have lifelong commitment to protect victim what assurance can he give my constituent that our new government will be tough on crime and on the cause of crime my hon friend be right to raise that important issue have to say when

condolence about jenny randerson apologise overlook that early the hon lady raise the failure of the snp and the legacy of the tories be proud that this labour government deliver the large budget settlement for scotland since devolution that mean in answer to her question that worker in scotland benefit from the increase to the national minimum and living wage each year an estimate million people in scotland will benefit from the extension of the cut in fuel duty which of course come on top of the million to set up great british energy in aberdeen it reinforce the point that the snp

chancellor who embellish her cv then we have transport secretary with fraud conviction and now we have an anti corruption minister who be be investigate for corruption know that the prime minister

cricket board make strong representation to the international cricket council on afghanistan woman cricket team set aside the matter of groom gang the opposition amendment on today order paper set out very clearly why the bill that we will be debate be so deeply flawed if it be to become an act of parliament it will have to be completely rewrite in committee the prime minister have make much from the dispatch box of his service as the public prosecutor so could he tell the house why during his time in that capacity he decline to instigate prosecution for rape and sexual abuse against mohamed fayed that case never cross my desk that complete prime minister question on point of order mr speaker during an answer about police number the prime minister say that someone on the conservative benches shout boring may correct the record follow request from hansard actually say bingo because of the repetitive and overused clichés that the prime minister be use you have correct the record would not have own up in the way you do but there we be quantitative easing prohibition motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to prohibit quantitative easing to prohibit the government from indemnify any loss that may result from quantitative easing and for connected purpose the purpose of this draft legislation be to ensure that the state be as economically accountable to the people as the people be to the state that mean terminate the state ability to debase the value of money through practice such as quantitative easing which be not an option for the individual clip sweating plug and cutting be form of coin debasement either by government or individual the most famous modern uk example be the great debasement between and when henry viii reduce the gold and silver content of coinage by the use of base metal such as copper in order to fund his bacchanalian overspending and war with france it have be common feature of government behaviour over the year of gold trading history and it continue today in the form of quantitative easing with no gold standard to constrain unproductive investment and direct capital to sound and profitable investment venture policymaker today have become obsess with short term stimulus centre on the performance of stock and bond market central bank have become uncontrolle unconstrained and reckless in their pursuit of deliver non stop unsustainable global growth drive by credit qe be what third world dictator use to indulge in shortly before their currency descend into chaos but it have now become mainstream tool to avoid the darwinian reality of capitalism history be litter with example of government dictator and king abuse their hard work citizen coinage during rome ascendant year be bold large and widely accept but it reduce in size weight and content as her empire wan there be john law mississippi scheme in france in to when he and the duke of orléans who be regent for louis xv preside over an establishment back scheme on the premise that paper money be preferrable to gold or metal back currency and that share be superior form of money as they pay dividend it be in essence the first national central bank it end in chaotic collapse and it badly damage france and her economy national debt be support by print money in the same way as today through qe via central bank globally fear that the ending will be the same in due course in weimar germany after the first world war the reichsbank have become accustomed to print money to fund the wartime economy increase mark in circulation from two billion to billion between and state debt rise by time from billion mark to billion mark that continue with the value of the mark go into freefall in early and the issuance of note of up to trillion mark before sense return it be time of moral decline short termism and prostitution that benefit the opportunist not the long term wealth creator with currency devaluation come decline in all that have previously be cherish include loyalty faith moral innocence and honour over recent time capitalism in the uk and globally have be undermine as state have grow in size and central bank have distort logic systemic risk management via the clearing bank in the be gradually replace by more overt intervention include by alan greenspan in and in when long term capital management an offshore company be bail out by the us government the year be watershed moment when gordon brown bail out financial institution at an estimate cost to taxpayer of billion follow by quantitative easing between march and august that be dwarf by the action of hank paulson and ben bernanke in the us in they use billion of intervention to prop up the financial system generally particularly aig during the covid crisis of and when many bad decision be take by an already bloated state between billion and billion equivalent to between and per person in the uk be spend in number of questionable centrally plan intervention in rather the same way as early weimar germany britain find itself heavily indebted and continue to run multiple deficit make matter progressively bad our moral decline be clearly evident as true capitalism have be undermine by regular intervention increase state regulation and grow bloated and inefficient state it be interesting that weimar germany revival start with the dismissal of many civil servant and social welfare spending be massively cut the french government recent funding crisis make it look even more like national ponzi scheme than in the uk both wing of french politic refuse to sanction debt reduction despite the budget deficit be expect to rise to over of gdp by this year market concern be push the euro low and france borrowing cost high with bond yield briefly surpass spain for the first time since javier milei argentina president since have bring significant economic reform with his radical libertarian agenda earn both praise and criticism milei focus have be on cut public sector spending reduce inflation and implement drastic fiscal adjustment which have lead to improvement in argentina economy

borrowing cost have drop signal reduce debt default risk elon musk have be appoint to lead donald trump new department of government efficiency which he will co run with trump ally and entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy musk say that the department creation would address government waste and inefficiency trump describe doge as transformative initiative aim at slash bureaucracy cut regulation and restructure federal agency and liken it to the manhattan project money be the foundation of all human exchange of enterprise and replace barter in the early community it allow for the transfer of skill through transferable medium such as coin note or indeed transfer by continuous process of inflation no matter how it be perpetrate government can confiscate secretly and unobserve an important part of the wealth of their citizen as they do so the size of the state inevitably grow and it become self serve greedy master of the people it should be serve common sense logic and human relationship among work people be inevitably undermine and there be general moral decline in society taxis should be transparent justifiable and simple the cost of government should be cover by taxis alone limit the growth of excessive statism gold have historically be the standard store of value and protection against currency debasement for over year it be interesting that profligate government always denigrate gold holding and hold it be often ban by government in crisis who have deceive their electorate the word of president woodrow wilson after he sign the federal reserve act should serve as warning to all of we be most unhappy man have unwittingly ruin my country great industrial nation be control by its system of credit our system of credit be concentrate the growth of the nation therefore and all our activity be in the hand of few man we have come to be one of the worst rule one of the most completely control and dominate government in the civilised world no long government by free option no long government by conviction and the vote of the majority but government by the opinion and duress of small group of dominant man friedrich von hayek an eminent austrian school economist say do not think it be an exaggeration to say history be largely history of inflation usually inflation engineer by government for the gain of government give the historical track record of state abuse their citizen by various form of currency debasement include qe the default position should be to make it illegal unless this democratically elect house have an inform vote support debasement this bill seek to achieve that position and commend it to the house question put and agree to order one of we have to sit down rupert have get to do my bit you come back in minute who will prepare and bring in the bill richard tice jim allister myself and other mr speaker you have get to name they you can not not name they james maybe rachel reeves do know laughter can you just read the name for clarity so that hansard have they richard tice jim allister james mcmurdock lee anderson and myself mr speaker order that rupert lowe richard tice jim allister james mcmurdock and lee anderson present the bill rupert lowe accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday january and to be print bill child wellbeing and schools bill second read relevant document seventh report of the education committee of session persistent absence and support for disadvantaged pupil hc and the government response session hc oral evidence take before the education committee on december on children social care hc the reason amendment in the name of the leader of the opposition have be select beg to move that the bill be now read second time in the week in which we return to this house and our child return to school be proud to be the secretary of state for education in truly child centre government the action take and the decision make be always in pursuit of what be good for the child of this country and that start with keep they safe after little more than six month in power we be deliver the change that be many year overdue no more lesson learn no more paper pushing and no more foot drag it be time for government to act and this government will act with the urgency that our child deserve and our country demand this bill put forward bold new measure to keep child safe these include new legal obligation for safeguard partner to work hand in hand with education because it be often teacher who first see the sign of abuse and neglect new duty to establish multi agency child protection team because keep child safe be everyone business new power to put in place unique identifier for child share information so that no child fall through the crack new compulsory register of child not in school in every area of england because if child be not in school we need to know where they be and new requirement for local authority consent for parent to home educate their child if they be on child protection plan or subject to child protection inquiry respect parent right to make choice about their child education but child safety must always come first and under this government their safety will always come first let we be crystal clear vote against this bill today be vote against the safety of our child against their childhood and against their future today conservative mp have choice they can choose to back measure to protect child or they can choose to chase headline they can choose to transform the life of the most vulnerable young people in this country or they can choose to sacrifice their safety for political gain they can choose to show the public that they have finally learn the lesson of their resounding election defeat or they can show voter that they be still unfit to govern want to be very clear that the conduct of politician be they on the conservative benches or anywhere else who put the pursuit of headline today above the safety of child tomorrow be sicken and shameful previous generation of conservative politician would not have have the slight hesitation in say that the conduct of today opposition in seek to block this bill be quite simply beneath contempt the secretary of state have mention previous generation of politician and all of we in this house must recognise that we follow in the footstep of giant tony blair lord adonis and other create the academy system that be build on under the last conservative government and bring about transformation of english education why do the secretary of state want to dismantle decade of work by member across this house and bring about gross socialist uniformity that will destroy the progress that have be make that be simply mischaracterisation and the right hon gentleman know it will come on to the wide school measure in this bill later in my speech but note that he have nothing to say in his intervention about the safety of child and the measure we be discuss today the wreck amendment that the leader of the opposition have table would block the very important very serious measure that the conservatives have be tell we for day they want to see put in place if they want those measure they need to support they the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart mention uniformity but the only uniform measure can see in the bill be about save parent money on uniform bill which think we can all welcome do the secretary of state agree that the fragmentation of the school system create by the last government lead to many young people fall through the gap which be huge issue will come on to the wide point of collaboration later in my speech collaboration across the school system be crucial but my hon friend be right to draw attention to the really important measure in the bill that will put more money back in parent pocket by cut the cost of school uniform and bring in breakfast club in primary school across our country this be child centre legislation through and through legislation that back parent to do the good for their child this government be on mission to break down the barrier to opportunity drive forward by the plan for change unveil by the prime minister in december the children wellbeing and schools bill be huge step forward in that journey of reform start with child safety and building from there it be an agenda for excellence for safe and secure childhood because healthy and happy future be build on nothing less it be an agenda for excellence for high and rise standard because we will accept nothing less it be an agenda for excellence for top quality core offer in all of our school because parent demand nothing less it be an agenda for excellence because every child in this country deserve nothing less that be what mission lead government be all about child centre action across departments between profession and through partnership what matter about family be not the shape that they have but the love they give that be why back in october we announce the expansion of our work on foster and on the trialling of new kinship care allowance it be why in november come to this house to set out the big reform of child social care in generation it be why this government then back those change with almost million of investment include the big ever investment in kinship care it be why today return to this house to cement our reform in legislation and to build child social care system that be forward look excellence drive and child centre our first priority be to keep child with their family wherever it be safe to do so so the bill mandate all local authority to offer family group decision making with the guidance of skilled professional family with child at risk of fall into care will be support to build plan that work for they we be strengthen support for kinship care so that vulnerable child can live with the people they know and trust wherever that be possible however despite the good effort of all involve some child will inevitably need to enter care so we must reform the system so that it work for they know that member right across this house share my outrage at the excessive and exploitative profit making that we have see from some private provider it be shameful it be unacceptable and it will end know that my right hon friend have good head for number will she be do some evaluation of the cost and benefit of invest in kinship care so that we can reduce not just the cost to the child but the cost to the taxpayer of expensive child social care my hon friend be absolutely right in my time with she on the public accounts committee learn all too well the importance of those principle the previous government have work under way on understanding not just the benefit for child of stay close to those who can care for they good but the spiral cost and the need to take action however what we do not see from that government be action and that be why we be today make sure that we deliver well for our child this bill give the government through the secretary of state the power to introduce profit cap provider should take note we will not hesitate to use this power to protect our most vulnerable child child must always have somewhere to live if private provider unexpectedly collapse that be why this bill introduce new financial oversight scheme to increase transparency and strengthen forward planning child need support when they leave care too so the bill will require all local authority to offer care leaver emotional and practical support through the staying close programme support in find great place to live support in access the right service at the right time and support in go on to live healthy happy life the children wellbeing and schools bill provide the safe and secure foundation that all child need and it build on that foundation with urgent reform to all our school so that every child can achieve and thrive that mean school be at the beat heart of their community that be why this bill legislate for free breakfast club in every state fund primary school so that child get welcoming soft start to the day it mean school where child come together to eat learn and grow it be good for attendance good for attainment and good for behaviour before my election spend nearly year as secondary school teacher see at first hand the devastating effect of food poverty on child health concentration and academic performance welcome the introduction of free breakfast club in primary school which will improve child health and learn outcome in england as see in wales however urge further action to ensure that all child can thrive will the government consider extend free breakfast to secondary school student and will consideration be give to access to free school lunch as well we will of course always keep further action under review through the child poverty taskforce which co chair the work and pensions secretary we be consider what further action be require to make sure that family have more money in their pocket and can increase their income and will take action the grow number of child we have see in poverty in our country be source of national shame and conservative members be responsible for that record school uniform be important for build sense of community but too many family tell we that the cost remain heavy burden so our bill limit the number of brand item that school can require pupil to have put money back in parent pocket want child in school and ready to learn and that be why the government plan for change set milestone for record number of five year old reach good level of development that be vital for give every child the good start in life but that be just the beginning because want high and rise standard for every child in every school that be one of the sure way that we can break the link between background and success for million of child that matter for every child not just lucky few life should not come down to luck when government forget that it be not the child of conservative members who lose out it be work class kid across our country know that well than most and will take no lecture from the conservative party on what it take to deliver well life chance for working class kid report figure for and show an increase in the proportion of child live in low income family and no change in the proportion of child live in absolute low income family do the secretary of state agree that the bill will improve the household finance of family and the life chance of child in my constituency of wolverhampton west absolutely the bill will put hundred of pound back into family finance and back into parent pocket by cut the cost of school uniform and by introduce breakfast club in every state fund primary school however we recognise that there be so much more we need to do because child poverty scar the life chance of far too many in our country could the secretary of state comment on the fall roll in some part of this country particularly london most local authority unfortunately take the option of closing school which be very damaging to child and to local community clause appear to give she some power of intervention so we could perhaps instead downsize such school which would mean we keep the sense of they be community school that be so important particularly in the poor part of many london borough can she give we some hope that there will be intervention so that we keep community school number of provision in the bill deal precisely with that challenge we recognise that in london but shortly this will be the case right across our country there be challenge that come with fall roll and make sure that we manage that properly that will require school to work with local council and to collaborate on manage admission and place planning it will also require decision on how we make good use of the school estate that be why we have start encourage primary school to bid to open primary base nursery the recent pilot programme for that have close and we be delighted to see so many application there be also an opportunity to think about use the space that will open up as result of fall roll to create additional provision for child with special educational need and disability so that they can go to school much close to home and can go to school with their friend in their local community there have be welcome consensus that high quality state education should be the right of all child that consensus have help to ensure that innovation from ofsted to the national curriculum and academy have stand the test of time as government of all party have drive reform academy introduce by the last labour government and expand by the conservative party have be instrumental in raise standard in our school system they have deliver brilliant result particularly for the most disadvantaged child and they will continue their record of excellence under this labour government however this consensus must not stifle progress while the conservative party do make some progress over the past year it must reckon with its many failure for example one in four child leave primary school without meet the expect standard in reading writing and math ten of thousand of child do not secure good math or english gcse one in five child be regularly absent from school they be unable to learn if they be not there and hold back their classmate when they return there be also hundred of thousand of child in school that perform poorly year after year protect the foundation should not mean that we do not build on they after decade of stagnation say decade because conservative members will remember time when they have an education secretary who be determined to deliver reform now be the time to press on and once again deliver for our child member will see in the bill respect for the fundamental twin with the drive to go far and deliver high and rise standard for each and every child we inherit system that be too fragmented and that too often incentivise harmful competition over helpful collaboration the secretary of state give lot of important statistic about how our child be develop but their mental health and wellbeing be also important will she consider national wellbeing measurement so we can look at improve the wellbeing of our child welcome the hon lady interest in this area because share her concern about the grow number of child in our country who be deeply unhappy and the grow challenge of mental ill health and ensure wellbee far too many child do not receive access to timely support and we be look carefully at the issue that she identify on child welfare and make sure that child start the school day in the good position to learn thank my right hon friend for bring forward plan for breakfast club so that child be ready to learn not only because they have have good meal but because they be ease into the school day do she agree that that will help young child and particularly kid with special educational need to learn agree with my hon friend we have be lead by the evidence on this which be clear this measure provide real support to parent at the start of the school day but also deliver benefit for child learning development academic outcome and behaviour be delighted that in april we will start roll out the first pilot across school include school serve child with special educational need and disability demonstrate the difference that this labour government will make to child life chance be sure that all member of the house share the right hon lady objective of ensure that child get the good education and have the good educational outcome possible but why be she dismantle the infrastructure that have deliver improvement we have specialist school school able to attract the good teacher and school able to tailor their curriculum to their pupil why do she want to dismantle that if she want to improve educational standard that be just not the case invite he to read the bill and will come on to further measure that we be propose if we believe that every child deserve the good that every classroom deserve top teacher and that every state school must be great school we can not have excellence for some child and just fine or okay for the rest we need all school work together to deliver national high quality core offer for all child and to have the flexibility to innovate beyond that so that parent know that wherever they live and whatever their local school this government be their child great champion the good school and trust do incredible work day in day out and pay tribute to they they be engine of innovation and civic leader and collaboration and improvement be central to their success they prove that excellence already exist in the system and it be time to spread it to all school that do not mean no competition competition can be healthy and spur to excellence but competition that encourage school to hoard good practice or to export problem to other must be replace by collaboration and by school work together to solve problem and put child first do not just mean collaboration within trust true collaboration also look outward so that there be school drive by share purpose embed in community our vision twin that deep collaboration with healthy competition so that every child in every school can benefit from good practice the bill bring reform it demand high and rise standard across the board we will restore the principle establish by the noble lord baker which be that every child will benefit from the same core national curriculum follow the curriculum and assessment review the national curriculum be conservative achievement benefit from it and this labour government will bring that legacy back for every child give every parent the confidence in standard that they deserve every child will be teach by an excellent qualified teacher who have undertake statutory induction that will be support by give every school the flexibility to create attractive pay and condition offer to recruit and retain excellent teacher and by back those school already do that to keep it go agree as would all members that we want excellent standard for all school one idea that the conservative government have be that if school be fail new management would go in to increase standard yet the secretary of state want to dismantle that would call that vandalism of our education system no invite the right hon lady to look carefully at the measure in the bill we will not hesitate to intervene in fail school indeed we will intervene lot soon than the conservatives do in school that be coast those school that fall short of the statutory level of intervention will see regional improvement team in their school drive up standard where there be failure in the system or where school be not deliver the standard that every child deserve we will act that action will always be guide by what be good for the child in those school that may well be academisation or it may be target intervention to drive change in practice and drive up standard rather than to change the structure the bill will convert the duty to issue academy order into the power to well deliver high and rise standard for all child strengthen the range of way through which failure can be tackle there can be no excuse for fixate on structure and not on standard because what matter be what work the bill end the presumption that new school should be academy give local authority the freedom to deliver the school that their community need that include the ability to open new special school something that member across the house know be major challenge this government will work tirelessly to make sure that all child with special educational need and disability receive the support they need to achieve and thrive the previous government leave that in the too difficult box but we will tackle it and ensure that all our child get great education the secretary of state mention special school and member across the chamber will have postbag fill with letter about far too many child who be not get the support they need with their mental health whether at special school or otherwise will she consider put mental health professional in all our school include special school so that our child wellbeing can be improve include their mental health share the hon lady concern about the mental health challenge that many of our young people be experience and we be commit to roll out mental health support right across our school on the wide challenge of support for child with special educational need and disability wish to make clear to the house that the reform we must engage in and the change require be complex and will take time invite member across the house the liberal democrats and other to work with we on the change that be require to get this right because for far too long child with special educational need and disability have be fail by this system parent have lose trust and confidence in it and it be bankrupt local council my right hon friend have speak about academy and various other form of school will she confirm that nothing in the bill would result in teacher in any school get pay cut my hon friend bring wealth of experience as teacher to the house know that teacher will want to hear what this will mean for their pay so reiterate that the measure in the bill and the change that we will bring forward to the schoolteacher pay and condition document in the following remit will not cut teacher pay the secretary of state have speak about her focus on standard the free school programme have drive up standard across the country so why be one of her first action to threaten free school project develop by parent pupil and community will she lift the veil of uncertainty over they we be look carefully at all the school in the pipeline but we need to ensure that in every case there be strong case for the need for the school and good value for the taxpayer we have inherit an enormous challenge when it come to the public finance and we have have to make difficult decision because of the billion black hole that the hon member and his party leave behind interruption the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott who be chuntere away be in cabinet as chief secretary to the treasury and responsible for oversee all of that return to support for child with special educational need and disability we will improve inclusivity in mainstream school while ensure that specialist provision can cater for those with the most complex need the change that the bill bring be underpin by our wide reform to drive improvement new school report card will give full picture of school performance new rise regional improvement for standard and excellence team will draw on the excellence in our system and bring school together to spread good practice and challenge underperformance accountability and inspection should be galvanise force for improvement and catalyst for quality raise the floor of success not lower the ceiling of ambition it should not drag school down but lift child up it be about they it be always about they be grateful for my right hon friend speech and not least for the opportunity to raise standard for child with disability child experience anxiety and child who have get care experience will she look at the role that local authority can play in building collaboration and ensure that they have the funding they need the last government hollow they out yet they have crucial role in raise standard and support school agree with my hon friend that we need to ensure that local authority be work with school health service and other partner in their area through the last budget we be able to deliver additional investment for our local council we want to see much great focus and priority on early help and early support and prevention because we know that that be where we can make the big difference to child life will the secretary of state give way will give way final time and then conclude be chair of governor of the academy and in welcome sir tony blair to that academy in northampton to show he the benefit of the freedom for governor to act with regard to the national curriculum with regard to pay and condition and with regard to innovation think that sir tony blair and lord adonis will be horrify by these change which will restrict the freedom to innovate and to improve it be great shame that be total misunderstanding of the bill the hon gentleman should not seek to speak for other in this regard we be restore academy to their core intend purpose of drive up standard for the most disadvantaged child in our country with innovation spread wherever we can do that really welcome the measure in the bill to ensure that the many child be home school have all the support they need to get back into mainstream education be extremely concerned to find out that in the last academic year child in hastings be be home schooled that be one in child or classroom of child while there will be parent provide good quality education at home know from speak to teacher and to local shop who see these child in their establishment that some be not necessarily get good education we need to get those child back into school agree with my hon friend recognise the challenge that she face in her constituency and that we see right across our country we have see big increase in the number of child be home educate while respect the right of parent to make that choice there be complex range of reason why many parent be now make that decision and there be question about how we support our child with their mental health and wide challenge on the send system let be absolutely clear to the house that all child not in school when they be be home educate must have good level of education we can not allow the situation to continue where we do not have visibility of where child be and they slip between the crack we will ensure through the bill that when child protection investigation be under way or there be child protection plan local authority will be able to decline that request from parent because we all sadly know what can go terribly wrong when we fail to step in and protect child on that issue will the secretary of state give way be afraid that be conclude now we be bring together the system many part into collaborative coherent whole with child at its heart our ambition to support child do not stop here we expect to bring forward further legislation when parliamentary time allow our work to erase the stain of child poverty must and will continue through the child poverty taskforce which be proud to co chair with the secretary of state for work and pensions reduce the burden on school free teacher to teach and child to learn today be about action when colleague from across the house read the bill in all its detail they will find run through its clause one golden thread one common theme one objective one common cause it be not structure or ideology and they will find no pet project or stale dogma they will see that our focus be firmly on child their life chance be the aim their protection be the objective and their success be our common cause this children wellbeing and schools bill be write for they it be introduce to the house for they it will be implement for they for their safety for their schooling and for their future commend the bill to the house call the shadow secretary of state beg to move an amendment to leave out from that to the end of the question and add this house while welcome measure to improve child protection and safeguarding decline to give second reading to the children wellbeing and schools bill because it undermine the long stand combination of school freedom and accountability that have lead to educational standard rise in england effectively abolish academy freedom which have be integral to that success and be regressive in approach lead to bad outcome for pupil because it end freedom over teacher pay and condition make it hard to attract and retain good teacher because it end freedom over qualified teacher status make teacher recruitment hard because it remove school freedom over the curriculum lead to less innovation because repeal the requirement for fail school to become academy and for all new school to be academy will undermine school improvement and remove the competition which have lead to rise standard because the bill will make it hard for good school to expand reduce parental choice and access to good education and call upon the government to develop new legislative proposal for child wellbee include establish national statutory inquiry into historical child sexual exploitation focus on groom gang the bill in front of we today be bill of two half one of which seek to protect child and improve safeguard and support for child in care while the opposition will seek to amend various aspect of what be be put forward in committee we do see value in it but the other half of the bill be the policy equivalent of wreck ball it be an all out assault on teacher the education system and standard it be nothing less than education vandalism and we will oppose it with every fibre of our being the house must be in no doubt that the bill really matter it destroy the consensus build over two decade in england on how to improve school consensus that have lead to english child be the good in the western world at reading and math can not understand why the government would seek to reverse that progress what be they hop to achieve it seem to be policy build purely on ideology more than that it be wrong desperately hope that government members will come to see that madam deputy speaker you would think that labour government would feel proud of the record they have on education under blair it be that labour government who innovate and make way for academy when blair talk about academy he say that an academy belong not to some remote bureaucracy not to the ruler of government local or national but to itself for itself the school be in charge of its own destiny that blairite principle school in charge of its own destiny be build on and expand by subsequent conservative government what have be the result of this largely cross party consensus thriving education system in which english child have soar up the programme for international student assessment ranking see before move away from all the thing that have enable that success the bill seek to turn its back on labour history and take back those academy freedom on curriculum on pay and on behaviour you name it they be reverse it all the thing that have do so much to improve our education system step by step the very policy that see our school rise up the international league table be be reverse guarantee that just as we go up as result of the bill we will come down those very same ranking and who will suffer the poor pupil in society have live the dream of the academy programme from the very beginning under london challenge and have see hackney child go to university they do not when be first elect but the last government bring in wreck ball they make smorgasbord of free school and offer an open chequebook to pay over the odd for inadequate site that child be condemn to for year with no accountability in the system as each bit fractured away the reason why standard have notionally go up be that some school go year without an inspection after they be rat be outstanding but they be far from outstanding when they be next inspect the right hon lady need to take responsibility and accountability for what her government do and applaud the secretary of state for what she be try to do to put it right have huge amount of respect for the hon lady but she will know that the academy programme be expand more than time under the last government and we go up the education ranking not down under the previous government the bill would abolish academy in all but name and for what because education ministers think that they know well than katharine birbalsingh and sir jon coles blair say in that command public service today be no more acceptable than command economy well someone need to tell the education secretary because that be exactly what she be propose in the bill it be anti rigour anti choice and anti accountability one of the most impressive aspect of the previous government be the work institute by michael gove to build on the reform of tony blair and carry on by successive secretaries of state such as my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds will my right hon friend commit the next conservative government to reverse these change and ensure that we have more choice for headteacher on curriculum hire and firing and expulsion so that we bring competition to the school sector not the dead hand of whitehall bureaucrat my right hon friend be absolutely right to be clear the bill propose pay cut for nearly teacher in future year because it impose national term and condition on teacher in academy have to ask what problem be the government try to solve teacher outside of national pay scale be pay more not less what have they get against highly pay teacher why on earth be the government come here today and tell ten of thousand of teacher that their pay be too high it be absurd level down seem to be this government priority the flexibility give on term and condition allow academy to offer thing such as long school day be the labour government propose to ban that the explanatory note to the bill set new standard in double speak when they praise the positive innovation and good practice in teacher pay and condition in some academy and say that the government want to ensure that local authority maintain school also have the opportunity to implement this so what be they do be they give these same pay flexibility to local authority school they be do opposite they be take pay flexibility away from academy do not try and make any sense of this because it be impossible it be entirely contradictory the government be also remove the requirement for fail school to be take over by an academy despite recognise the strong track record of multi academy trust turn around fail school what be they replace it with they mention regional improvement for standard and excellence rise team official sit in the department for education but in another breath they say that those team will not be involve in fail school the government have clearly totally fail they do not understand that the reason that fail school become academy by default be that it be the most effective intervention if it be not mandatory there will be lot of massive row about what will happen to fail school and inevitable delay and legal challenge what be the upshot more time with child in fail school not be deal with what be their plan for fail school what be their plan to protect those child from fall behind what be the evidence that this approach be well have they trialle it anywhere why on earth be they put this into bill without clear alternative failure regime in place that evidence show be at least as good the bill be totally unacceptable and misunderstand why the academy order have be so important can not say this strongly enough to the government benches it need to change will the right hon lady concede that the academisation process have mean that the off rolling that we have see up and down this country have lead to the crisis in send that be the whole point of how the academy system have apparently improved standard it have not it have decrease inclusion will she please show we how the academy system have help our child who be now stick at home because they have be off roll be glad that the hon lady have confirm that the labour party be indeed anti academy the bill go on and on rampant centralisation in search of cause why be the government make all school follow the national curriculum where be the evidence that there be problem why be they put in place sweep power to direct academy on unspecified thing what possible justification do they have for that the note say that it be to prevent unreasonable use of power say look in the mirror my right hon friend have mention pay and power think they lie behind the bill because the education union oppose at every step under the last labour government and under the last conservative government the dinosaur tendency which we just hear from the hon member for gravesham dr sullivan show that the government viscerally dislike the freedom of academy and they turn their face against the transformation of educational outcome not least for the poor because of ideology rather than genuine commitment to the child sadly think my right hon friend be absolutely correct see no other reason for the academy provision to be in the bill it actually say in the explanatory note that the primary aim of this legislation be to make the education system more consistent that be at the heart of the problem today because more consistency do not well education system make it be classic labour argument one size must fit all lop the top off the tall poppy god forbid that school might be able to innovate and learn from each other and teacher might have freedom in the classroom to try new thing back up by regulator that rigorously inspect and identify failure that be an excellent education system but one that aim solely for consistency be not system of command and control stifle teacher supressing innovation with everything decide in an office in whitehall far away from the classroom it be same old labour consistency for all excellence for none the right hon lady have refer repeatedly to command control and consistency as if the latter be problem presumably she be part of the government that seek to use academy as mechanism by which to control individual school from whitehall rather than have the individual involvement of local authority the whole point of academy be to drive up standard by free they from state control the bill undermine all that which be why it would abolish academy in all but name urge government members to look at what the education part of the bill would do look at the labour history under education secretaries such lord adonis do not destroy something that the labour party help to build the government must get rid of the academy element of the bill they will not improve the school system they will make it bad do not destroy the work and policy of two decade at the stroke of bureaucrat pen we must ask ourselves who this be all about be we on the side of ideology union and bureaucrat or be we on side of the child and teacher and make sure that the most disadvantaged get the good possible education if it be the latter the education section of the bill must go let come to the final part of our amendment on national groom gang inquiry this debate have be take too far away from the victim and what be right for they there be legitimate argument to be have in this area but the one will not accept be that to call for an inquiry be to be far right the labour government have to understand that they must explain their action not just call the opposition name local inquiry which the labour government say be the answer do not have legal power to summon witness take evidence under oath or requisition evidence some of the leader of the manchester inquiry resign after they say that they be block from access information first commend the shadow minister for this amendment and for the last part in particular as everybody in this chamber probably know my politic be very much leave of centre but fully support what the conservative party be do with this amendment and my party will also be support the conservative on it the reason be quite simple the woman and child who have face injustice over the decade deserve to see the grossly pervert perpetrator who carry out unbelievable thing against child over the year face justice we seek justice for they the conservative party seek justice for they the amendment the conservatives have put forward today encapsulate the feeling of not just this house but this nation be enormously grateful for the hon gentleman support and agree completely this be an enormous scandal and yet we do not fully know the number of victim or perpetrator or where it have take place hope that the right hon lady and opposition members will reflect that what we have see recently be case study in disinformation turbocharge by social medium include personal smear today be the late example of how those who flirt with populism misuse sensitive and important issue it be exemplify by how the shadow minister and other conservative members be willing to wreck bill that be actually about improve child wellbee she should reflect on how they chase headline and jump on bandwagon while my right hon friend on the front bench take action after year of inertia have be very clear today that the bill will destroy the education system in this country and reverse the progress that we have make and that be why we oppose it on the hon gentleman broad point condemn the language that have be use against hon member in this house however he will recall that the labour party put out social medium graphic that grey out the then prime minister my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak and claim that he say that paedophile should not go to prison it be incumbent on all of we in this house to be moderate in our language this be an enormous scandal and yet we do not fully know the number of victim or perpetrator or where it have take place the previous conservative government set up the grooming gang taskforce which make more than arrest in the first year with victim in rotherham alone this will potentially encompass ten of thousand of child we therefore need comprehensive national inquiry into groom gang to tell the truth just for clarification should government member do the right thing tonight and vote for our amendment there would be no wrecking of any bill they just need to vote the right way as ever my right hon friend be absolutely correct there be no reason that action can not be take at the same time as national inquiry it be not an either or if the government want to disagree with that they will have to argue their case on the fact and not simply smear any opposition to they as far right or say that parliamentary procedure mean it can not happen will the right hon lady give way no be go to finish this be an opportunity for mp across the house to give victim the justice they deserve hon member have hear our argument on the inquiry and on school hope that today when we vote on our reason amendment the government see sense on both call the chair of the education committee our education system and the wide network of service that support child and family offer unparalleled opportunity to make critical difference to the life chance of the next generation if government get the policy framework right they can support every child to thrive in their education close the disadvantage gap and lie the foundation for good mental health and wellbeing which will set child up for life however the situation that this government inherit in july be overall very far from that there be of course many school teacher and other professional who work with child and young people who be do an exceptional job and achieve good result as we consider this important legislation want to pay tribute to everyone who work to give our child and young people the good possible start in life great education support where they need it and access to opportunity and those who do the very difficult work of keep the most vulnerable child safe the challenge in our system be not down to they they be the consequence of layer upon layer of policy decision take since that have make the context in which they work immeasurably hard shall mention just few of those policy decision the decision to cut the funding for early help and support for family result in the closure of sure start centre strip away vital support that can prevent family from reach crisis while fund for early help and support have reduce expenditure on child protection and on child in the care system in crisis situation that can often be prevent have go up the decision to make academy school directly accountable to the secretary of state and responsible for their own admission policy and to make free school the main delivery method for new school have leave local authority which retain the statutory duty for provide school place for every child who need one and for send provision without the tool and lever to deliver they create an unaccountable and unmanageable wild west of admission in many area the neglect of the send system have allow it to reach breaking point and child be routinely let down the capacity of school to meet their need have be erode and there be lack of accountability for the role of health service local authority be be push to the edge of effective bankruptcy school attendance have be fall at completely unacceptable rate and our child and young people have the bad mental health and wellbee in europe where we should have system of many part all work together in the good interest of child and family we have broken system where some part be miss entirely and other be buckling under the pressure far too many child particularly those with send be be let down in too many case either child be not protect from harm as they should be or the outcome of the attempt of the system to protect they be shamefully poor we need only to look at the shocking over representation of care experience people who be homeless or in the criminal justice system to know that our system be fail we need only to reflect on the name of the child who have be tragically kill at the hand of those who should have protect and nurture they star hobson arthur labinjo hughes and sara sharif among other to know that child protection urgently need to be strengthen welcome the bill which begin the work of stitch back together support system for child and family and place child once again at the heart of government policy measure such as the creation of single child identifier and register of child not in school restore the ability of local authority to deliver new school place and intervene on admission tackle profiteer by provider of child home deliver free breakfast club reduce cost of uniform and many other measure in the bill will make big difference to child and their family the education committee be take close interest in this legislation which be relevant to our ongoing inquiry on child social care send and many other aspect of our work and there be number of area on which would like to press ministers today the measure to improve child social care be welcome but it be well establish that local authority face huge cost pressure which mean that the system do not function as well as it should local authority that be currently trap in cycle of spot purchase residential place for look after child from expensive out of area provider will need support and funding to make the transition to more positive way of work even if those new way of working can bring down cost in the long term what investment will the government make in child social care to ensure that the change in the bill can be fully deliver with the maximum impact the million of funding for breakfast club provide in the autumn budget will extend the exist breakfast club scheme from around school to around school but there be more than state fund primary school in the uk can therefore press the government on the need to set out the cost and funding for deliver this policy in every primary school and for clear timescale for do so parent of child with send often find it hard to find childcare for their child many have express concern at clause in the bill that will allow for exemption from the requirement to provide breakfast club for disabled child some disabled child will also be able to access breakfast club only if they have home to school transport to arrive at school early will ministers confirm that the bill will ensure equal access to breakfast club for child with send in mainstream and specialist setting with support where need to enable child to attend they breakfast club ensure that no child have to start the school day hungry which will be transformative however school lunch also really matter as the most effective way to ensure access to nutritious hot meal for the most disadvantaged child will ministers therefore consider whether auto enrolment of child already eligible for free school meal can be incorporate into the bill as minimum we should ensure that all child who be currently eligible receive free school lunch the hon lady mention school breakfast child obesity be up by third and diabetes be up by fifth do she agree that while free breakfast club be great opportunity to ensure child be feed we must also ensure that school meal be healthy and nutritious and that alongside the bill school food standard need to be update in line with the most recent nutritional advice make it clear that they apply to breakfast order we have very long speaking list so intervention must be short agree with the hon lady that school food in whichever set it be deliver should be of the high quality she will know about the pressure on school budget my constituency have experience among the high drop in funding for local school of anywhere in the country that have erode the money that school have to spend on high quality food know that that be one of the area on which those on the government front bench will be anxious to deliver over time as public finance permit the measure to support care leaver be welcome but be limit to extended stay close support and require local authority to publish the detail of their offer what further measure do the minister intend to take to improve outcome for care leaver and to ensure they get the same opportunity as their peer only of care leaver go to university compare with of non care experienced young people what further measure will the government take to support care leaver to access and stay in high education why be the government not propose national offer for care leaver to address the postcode lottery in care in particular to provide care leaver with the confidence that if they choose to attend university away from home because that be the good option for they the same support will be available to they wherever they study the policy and practice of other departments also have profound effect on the experience of care leaver can the minister confirm whether outside of the bill the government be still consider the expansion of corporate parenting duty so that every part of the state be require to take seriously its duty to look after child and care experienced people finally to deliver on the commitment in the bill those who work with child and family will need support there be challenge in recruitment and retention across many of the profession from social work to teach to the early year will the government set out workforce strategy to ensure that training place continue professional development and effective recruitment strategy be in place to secure the staff we need to deliver the transformation our child deserve the bill will introduce series of measure that will start the process of rebuild support for child and their family and that be very welcome my committee will continue to take an interest in the detail of the bill and seek to ensure that it be as effective as it can be in deliver system that can support every child to thrive and in contribute to the debate about the further step beyond the scope of the bill that will also be need call the liberal democrat spokesperson after five year in this place be relieve and delight that and other hon member finally have the chance to consider piece of legislation that focus on child the bill get to the heart of our share duty as public representative to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our child the liberal democrats will approach the bill in spirit of constructive co operation urge colleague across the house to do the same for the sake of our child up and down the country on that particular note turn to the reason amendment table in the name of the leader of the opposition the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch everyone in this house agree that no child should ever face sexual abuse and exploitation we all agree that the state must comprehensively investigate all allegation we must deliver justice and prevent these sicken act from happen again in future where we disagree be on how to achieve that we on the liberal democrat benches want action that help victim and prevent these crime from happen again the conservative party want to derail this important bill instead we will table amendment ensure the recommendation of the jay inquiry be implement in full we will be party of constructive opposition and we will aim to strengthen the bill and its crucial measure on child protection and safeguarding for that reason we can not accept the opposition wreck amendment our child safety and wellbeing be simply far too important we owe it to they all to get this right can the hon lady set out exactly in what way the amendment which think be entirely constructive it accept the safeguard element but challenge the educational vandalism that be be undertake by the government be so objectionable humbly say to the right hon gentleman who have be in this place much long than have that understand that if the reason amendment be pass the bill would fall that be why it be not constructive amendment that be why it be wreck amendment do not think kill bill that seek to improve safeguard and safety for our child be the way to get justice for innocent victim of sexual abuse there be much in the bill that we on the liberal democrat benches welcome but of course there be area of detail where we will seek to probe and strengthen and measure on which we will seek to go far as the bill make its way through the house we will provide that detailed scrutiny challenge and improvement some important change be in the provision on kinship care the secretary of state will be aware that this be subject close to my heart and those of my party colleague it be an issue close to my heart as well as move into the care of my grandparent as young teenager do my hon friend agree that it be crucial we get this absolutely right first time because it be such rare opportunity to address kinship care minister should keep listen to kinship organisation to fill in the gap that those organisation see in the bill particularly in relation to the definition and to mental health care support thank my hon friend for his intervention he be absolutely right welcome the measure that put information about the local kinship care offer on statutory footing recognise the crucial role of kinship carer and finally put statutory definition into law which we have long call for yet definition in and of itself will not provide the financial and practical support that many family and child need area where the government be take action be limit to certain sub group of kinship carer and their child thus undermine the value of the propose definition the charity kinship say it would hope to see future legislation and the forthcoming multi year spending review far prioritise wide kinship care reform therefore ask the secretary of state and will ask the minister during the progress of the bill when they plan to expand the current pilot scheme to provide allowance to all kinship carer why do the educational support in the bill not seek to extend pupil premium plus and priority admission for child in kinship care we welcome the bill provision on child safeguarding include the register of child not in school as liberal our party firmly uphold the right of parent to educate their child at home when it be the good choice for their child in of case parent know what be good for their child but it be deeply concern that there may be many thousand of child whose whereabouts be simply unknown that reality can contribute as we have see all too recently to tragic safeguarding failure and that can not continue can the hon lady provide single instance where child who be in home education we must remember that child at school spend about of their time out of school who be at harm be not know to social service already too easily there be conflation of failure of social service which need to be fix with home education which be entirely separate all the evidence point to the fact that the education and school sector must be key safeguarding partner which be why it be in the bill when child have be identify as be at risk ensure that they be in school which the bill seek to do will help to safeguard they we see this all too tragically in the recent case of sara sharif she be take out of school and then abuse at home and tragically die she be be abuse anyway the point be that this be just an additional measure to ensure that child like she be safe want to reiterate to colleague across the house that we absolutely support and champion the right of parent to home educate this be not an attack on home education it be about ensure that all child be safe that be the view of the children commissioner the national society for the protection of cruelty to children and many other organisation and in fact party across the house the conservatives themselves start to legislate for this in the last parliament but then bin the provision there be cross party consensus on this measure there be area of detail that we need to dig into during the bill progress but in headline term the register be crucial tool in the armoury that we give local authority to ensure that our child be safe as have say it have be call for by many organisation and all party however the volume of information request from parent place significant and potentially intrusive burden on those who choose to home educate for the right reason so we must ensure that data collection be strictly necessary and proportionate and be be use appropriately clause set out the case in which parent and carer must seek permission to withdraw child from school would question the inclusion of child place in special school when there be safeguard concern about child the local authority should be able to step in to ensure that they receive their education at school however some child need will not be meet in the special school in which they be place and parent may feel that they have no option but to home educate in such case should not the presume option be to improve the child experience of the school or to work with the family to secure alternative provision rather than use the blunt instrument of clause we know that after year of neglect and mismanagement by the conservatives our school be cry out for support for student parent and teacher endure crumble building persistent underfunding and spiral send crisis hear the conservatives rhetoric today will be utterly gall the bill take welcome step in restore local authority power to propose new maintain school especially give the desperate need in many area for new special school which local authority have regularly be prevent from establish in recent year although it be disappointing that it do nothing else to start address the reform that be so desperately need to improve the special educational need system we also welcome the co operation on school admission criterion together these change empower community to allocate educational resource locally but some clarification be need let ask specifically what assessment the government have make of the impact of require every single teacher to have or to work towards qualified teacher status and whether they have speak to the sector about that we all agree that we want qualified teacher in our school but there may be some unintended consequence when non qualified teacher be bring in to run certain service and extracurricular activity be the government confident that this measure will not lead to those unintended consequence the provision on pay should seek only to set minimum floor not maximum ceiling on what staff can be pay take on board what the secretary of state say in response to an early intervention that no one pay would be cut but that be retrospective reflection hope that in future all school whether or not they be academy should be able to pay premium in order to attract the right staff if they have the resource to do so interruption from sedentary position the conservatives be say that they will not be able to do that in committee we will seek to amend the bill to make it clear that this should be floor not ceiling my experience as an employment lawyer be that academy school generate large amount of employment right litigation because they tend not to treat their staff very well interruption some do of course but litigation be not in the good interest of child and ensure that child have teacher who be adequately pay be key consideration for labour members be not in position to comment on the statistic relate to employment law issue in different type of school suspect that whichever type of school we look at we will find case across the board but be not sure that be up for debate today the title of the bill include the word child wellbeing but child poverty be the key issue hinder the wellbeing of child in the uk today the shameful legacy of the conservative government be one of far too many child go hungry at school we liberal democrats have put forward fully cost plan to extend free school meal to the child in poverty up to the age of who be currently exclude and it be disappointing that the government have not take this opportunity to ensure that no child go hungry throughout the school day meal at lunch time may be the only hot nutritious meal that some child get and all the evidence show that it help they to concentrate and learn through the course of the day and achieve well outcome we must also bear in mind that hunger do not end at breakfast club can be useful but expand lunch provision be far more ambitious measure and one that would have great impact on child hunger as be point out by the chair of the select committee the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes far too many family who be entitle to claim free school meal be not do so there be an estimate such case not only be those child miss out on the hot meal to which they be entitle but their school be miss out on much need pupil premium funding welcome the hon lady comment about the need for young people to have hot food at jerounds primary school in my constituency the kitchen be close because of reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and the last government failure to provide the necessary fund so none of those child can have hot food do the hon lady agree that be not good enough absolutely and be very sorry to hear about that case the last government do not deal with raac in our school building and it be as result of work that my colleague and do along with labour members to expose some of the shocking extent of it that we finally start to get some traction on the issue the liberal democrat lead coalition administration in durham county council introduce auto enrolment for free school meal in september last year an extra child have be sign up and there have be an extra million in pupil premium funding for the county just imagine the impact that that model could have nationally hope that the government will take this opportunity to expand free school meal and introduce auto enrolment be disappointed to see no mention of mental health in wellbee bill this be an opportunity to tackle the mental health crisis that we be see among our child and it be crucial that we do not allow that opportunity to slide away give that on average six child in every classroom have mental health condition the government could have seize the chance to ensure that every school in the country whether primary or secondary have statutory and fully fund duty to provide dedicated mental health professional as the bill progress my liberal democrat colleague and will seek to do just that and be sure that we can count on support from across the house my hon friend be make an excellent and balanced case for protect child many child with mental health problem and autism be educate at home because there be no realistic alternative do she agree that the secretary of state should be encourage to ensure that the support give to home educate family under clause include free access to examination which can cost hundred of pound child be struggle to benefit from good home education because of the cost do my hon friend support that idea be happy to support that in fact when the previous administration introduce the school bill which they then decide to bin the liberal democrats in the house of lords table an amendment that do just that and be sure that we will seek to do the same this time around to help the family who choose to home educate although this bill set out some important reform to our school system the liberal democrats would like to see great ambition the attainment gap have widen significantly in recent year and it be unacceptable that outcome for less affluent and more vulnerable student be get bad we believe that one piece of the puzzle would be tutoring guarantee for every disadvantaged pupil who need support when implement correctly tutoring have prove its worth time and again seven in parent whose child receive tutoring at school say that it have raise their child attainment we know that it also boost young people confidence and tutoring can help tackle persistent absence which be huge issue in our school hope the secretary of state agree that tutoring guarantee introduce via this bill would be powerful tool in narrow the attainment gap and ensure that every child get the high quality education they deserve let reiterate that this be bill that we must get right now be not the time to play politic now be the time to work to keep our child safe to give they the chance to flourish that be our task across this house and it be the mission that my party will pursue as the bill progress do not wish to set time limit so if colleague keep their contribution nice and short and tight we can try to get everybody in thank those on the front bench for the speed with which they have bring forward the bill so early in the parliamentary term as former teacher and local authority child lead know how important so many of the measure be an importance match only by how overdue so many of they be too which be why it be such shame to see other seek to turn the debate into political sideshow when it should really be an opportunity for the house to come together behind some powerful and important safeguarding measure as teacher who see at first hand the importance of breakfast club for deliver the good start to school day for young people and as local authority leader who work to expand they be really excited to see that clause bring forward labour commitment to ensure that no child start school hungry no one should tolerate child start school without the food they need to learn and to be ready for their school day and be glad that this government certainly will not do so today however want to focus on some of the measure relate to keep some of the most vulnerable child in society safe and ensure that they have the support they need be particularly pleased to see clause which place on local authority an obligation to have register and visibility of every child off the school roll as former local authority lead know that read serious case review be an important part of preparation for any role and certainly for that one if we read those serious case review and story of what can happen to some of the most vulnerable young people when they be allow to fall off the radar and to slip through the net and when they be leave open to exploitation and abuse by some of the most evil people in our society we can be under no illusion as to why this measure be so important absolutely understand why at first reading those who home school might have some concern about it but this be absolutely not an attack on home schooling the right to home school be important certainly at time when inclusion and support in school be far from what it should be for child with some of the high need and it be important that that be protect but just as every parent have the right and responsibility to do what be right for their child we all have the right and responsibility to ensure that no child can be leave vulnerable and fall between the crack this bill do that and be incredibly proud to be stand with colleague and support measure that know so many of we have call for in variety of role over the last decade do the hon gentleman have sympathy with parent who feel that they have be let down by the local authority on support for their child with special educational need who recognise the historical primacy of parent in determine the education of their child and who be now see piece of legislation that remove that right and say that the state not the parent decide whether child can be take out of school we all accept that where there be safeguard issue action should be take but be the hon gentleman really comfortable with change the approach for the ordinary parent after decade of it be the other way around thank the right hon gentleman for one of his many intervention today be not sure hear an apology for the state in which send provision be leave by the previous government but absolutely recognise the point that think he be try to make if he read the bill however he will see lot of assurance in choose to set the threshold as high as section assessment child protection assessment under the children act we have be incredibly cautious about where we have draw the line some outside this house might even say we have be too cautious about where we have draw the line but it recognise the important balance that have to be strike here for exactly the reason that the right hon gentleman allude to alongside that think colleague across the house recognise the fact that for far too long child social care have not be do right by some of the most vulnerable people in our society at great cost the system be deliver really poor outcome for vulnerable young people it be not provide the love and support that they need and that love and support do not last anywhere near long enough into their adult life no parent would expect their responsibility to end when their child turn would not tolerate that for my child and be sure no one in this chamber would yet as society we all too often do so for those who be in our care that be why the bill requirement around stay put and around make sure that we have publish care leaver offer will be so important welcome the secretary of state leadership which have ensure that we have move at pace and look forward to continue to work with she and with organisation that speak on behalf of care leaver right across the country to ensure that the bill measure be implement in the most effective and robust way possible those in our care would expect nothing less and be sure that all of we across the house will make sure that we hold ourselves to high standard alongside that it be pretty clear and fair to say that for far too long the care system have not recognise the value and importance of wide family network in deliver the good possible outcome for vulnerable young people that be why clause which bring forward the requirement for family group decision making could be such powerful tool if do well family group decision make conference make sure that there be constellation of family involvement early in child case potentially keep they out of the care system and make sure that all the people who can exert positive influence on that child life can be bring into the process as early as possible this be really welcome step forward that could be transformative for the care system again look forward to work with colleague from right across the house to make sure that we can implement this measure in the most effective way possible work with local authority to deliver all the benefit that family group conference if do well have be show to have along with many labour colleague and opposition members who have campaign on behalf of kinship carer many time in my quite short parliamentary career be glad to see the important recognition of their role in this process kinship carer step up for vulnerable young people in their care and it can not be right that so many of they be prevent from support young people in their care by rigid and bureaucratic care system no kinship carer should have to sign up and become foster carer just to look after young person when they have to do so it be clear that the system be do too little to enable what be right that be why it be so important that the measure in this bill recognise the importance of kinship care start to codify it and bring in local offer which be welcome alongside that the important measure to cut down on some of the unnecessary cost in the system whether they be due to hire agency worker or to excessive profiteer by child home have to be welcome too we must make sure that every penny of the money we rightly spend on child service can go towards protect and look after vulnerable young people there be so much else to welcome in this bill which be sure great many colleague will touch on there be definitely more to do from tackle the crisis that we inherit in send provision to make sure that we have the foster carer we need to support our young people there will be more important work for this government to do and have absolutely no doubt that my front bench colleague will show great leadership on those issue over the month to come today be about action and do what be right for some of the most vulnerable young people in our society it be about bring forward measure that could have come before this house long time ago but it have take this government this minister and this education secretary to finally show leadership be incredibly proud to be support they today and be very happy to be stand on this side of the argument in the chamber be sure that today labour mp will cheer what they see as the final demise of the gove gibb reform but the bill before we reverse far far back than that if this bill pass in anything close to its current form it will be as if lord adonis be never the schools minister and lord blunkett have never sit in the secretary of state place it will be as if tony blair have never be prime minister and have never make central to his pledge to the british people in those famous three word education education education to be clear there be thing in this bill that we agree with there be thing that be in our bill there be thing that build on the work that we be do on stay close on virtual school head on kinship care and more of course there be also thing in the bill that be design to be eye catch initiative something that the government learn from new labour such as the retail offer to use the jargon on breakfast club there be already thousand of breakfast club in our country by the way we would like to know what will happen to breakfast club at secondary school where they would make more of an impact on attendance than in primary school there be also the provision on uniform we have have statutory guidance on uniform for long time so have no idea why it be necessary to write it into law the principal aim seem to be to outlaw primary school require the wearing of tie the big part of this bill read the detail be about attack school and trust autonomy and give power back to whitehall and the local education authority colleague on both side of the house know there have be dramatic transformation in educational attainment in this country we now have the good primary school reader in the western world and we have see dramatic improvement in secondary school math reading and science child eligible for free school meal be now more likely to go to university than they be in why have that happen in one word teacher it be teacher who have make that happen but there be also brilliant dedicated teacher in wales and scotland where those improvement have not happen the most effective teacher exist in an ecosystem and what have really create the potential for these improvement be that brilliant teacher have be support by our reform those reform have always have two side first there have be relentless focus on standard and quality with knowledge rich curriculum and prove method such as synthetic phonic and math mastery school have be learn from school with hub system across the country and critically within academy trust which be the key vehicle for school improvement we have always know that this focus have to go hand in hand with diversity and choice parent must be able to select what be good for their child and we believe there be role for big school small school co ed school mixed school denominational school and so on of course academy and free school have enable that diversity to increase far to have effective school choice there have to be capacity in the system there have to be more place than there be child which be why we have add more than million new place since follow the labour party unbelievable decision to cut place in its last year in government finally to have diversity and choice parent need clear information the key progress metric be so much well than what come before the five plus plus at gcse measure or contextual value add combine with clear ofsted judgment this have enable parent to understand quickly and easily what be go on in different school could make some point about progress but that be not why be intervene just yesterday my local news website report that dr brown the award win found headteacher of the award win maple hayes hall school for dyslexia in lichfield use his birthday message to say that the obsessive focus on synthetic phonic be hold back pupil that be not say that it come from the award win headteacher of an award win school be grateful to the hon gentleman for let the house know that the new labour party still reject synthetic phonic which have the most remarkable depth of evidence behind it in favour of its fashionable progressive policy this be why say that all the progress achieve by our reform be at imminent risk labour have already stop new free school and now there will be far few academy conversion even exist academy be about to see their freedom erode what be the practical benefit of all these erosion take the qualified teacher status requirement school be not go around en masse recruiting teacher without qualification but there can be time when it be right for school to employ teacher from the independent sector or another country what will this requirement achieve or take the statutory pay and condition framework know of no evidence that academy group be undercut pay and condition if any labour member do they should please intervene some academy group pay more and what do that mean it mean they be invest the right hon gentleman need to understand that it be about pay and condition not just pay and it need to be national if we be to recruit and retain teacher the previous government fail on every single measure to retain and recruit qualified teacher be grateful to labour colleague for their intervention and for tell this house and the country what they need to know all these successful school and trust have be do exactly that they have bring new talent into the profession and they have help to improve retention but no they be not the right people to make that decision be they no labour mp and labour ministers should be make that decision for they the vast majority of school follow the national curriculum but some innovate what be wrong with that what be wrong with add something on top of the national curriculum in any case every school be statutorily require to deliver balanced and broadly focused curriculum and they be check on that by ofsted finally there be the power for council to prevent good popular school from expand what could that possibly achieve except create more disappointed family child and parent the one thing these four measure will achieve be tick one more union demand this bill can not be see in isolation look at the government broad proposal scrap the latin excellence programme scrap the expansion of the cadet programme in state school make ofsted judgment less transparent and tax independent sector education for the first time in our country history and almost uniquely in the world in way that will fill more of the most popular state school and make it hard for family to get their child into the state school of their choice potentially the big thing of all be the curriculum review this bill say that school must follow the national curriculum before the new national curriculum be set out it pre empt the review we do not know what will be in the review and we have to keep an open mind and see what come forward but remind colleague that the government be not force to adopt what the independent reviewer come up with nor be they oblige to stop where the independent reviewer do in this country since the start of the national curriculum we have always take the approach of not specify exactly what kid will learn in sensitive subject such as history english literature and religious education people often misunderstand this but it be not list of the thing pupil learn in school have broad framework have help to guard against the politicisation or the over politicisation of education it would be very dangerous if instead ministers come up with more prescriptive approach to the national curriculum especially if this bill remove the safety valve of school be able to deviate somewhat be listen with interest to the right hon gentleman point about the national curriculum which we know academy currently do not have to follow note that of school across the country no long enter any pupil for gcse music and the figure be for drama and for dance do he think that be factor in this debate the hon gentleman should have add the gcse number to the number for technical and vocational qualification otherwise it be misleading we all want kid to study the subject they wish to study and the subject from which they will benefit be not sure how what the hon gentleman say negate what just say which be how we normally debate the curriculum review be also an assessment review and we have hear much less about what that mean we know that the labour party have form on this when it be last in government with its target rich might say target obsessed approach to achieve five or more gcse at grade or above include english and math on the face of it that be perfectly good target but when be on the education committee back in when it be chair by my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart we have an inquiry on grade inflation count different way in which the figure be massage such that it look like thing be get well every year but when the oecd number come out we be tumble down the international table it be naive because what get measure get mangle and worry that be about to happen all over again it do child no favour also on international ranking at the end of labour last term in government we be the only country in the developed world where the literacy and numeracy of young adult be poor than that of the generation about to retire at least in the new labour era labour members believe they be pursue academic excellence but be afraid that have now go out of fashion the progressive phrase we hear from labour members sound relevance though they be beguile those thing rarely actually help the child they be think to help the pursuit of true excellence in state education be not elitist it be the opposite of elitist it level the play field and it mean that people from all background can be up with those elite whatever attack labour make on the independent sector or to try to take down top perform state school the advantage and the privilege will always lie with child wherever they be whose parent be actively involve and engage they will always do well it be not they who need our reform it be everyone else under this bill it will be everyone else who suffer after decade of campaign for the health of child and well school food be so pleased that universal primary breakfast club provision be be put on statutory footing in the bill there be no great priority for this government than raise the healthy generation of child ever the fact that the conservative party be try to play politic with the wellbeing of child when it come to this bill be true reflection of where its priority lie provide free breakfast to all primary school pupil be yet another manifesto commitment fulfil and it will transform the life of child across the country the education endowment foundation find that school breakfast can help deliver two month worth of extra attainment at key stage there will also be huge health outcome one in three child be already at risk of future food relate ill health such as type diabete or heart disease by the age of by provide nutritious breakfast we can ensure that child start their day at school ready to learn however be concerned that the bill do not include any kind of nationwide system of monitor the food serve in breakfast club the school food standard set out over year ago be still not be enforce child will be at risk though it will not necessarily happen of be serve poor quality breakfast under the scheme alongside the roll out we need to put in place the recommendation in the excellent school food plan about ofsted and the enforcement of standard hope that will be consider in later stage and iteration of the bill speak of health outcome it be miss opportunity not to include auto enrolment for free school meal in the bill as other have say today the department for education have report that nationally of family who be entitle to claim free school meal have not apply to receive they that mean that child in england be miss out on their statutory right to free school meal that be due to barrier such as complex application process language or literacy challenge stigma and low awareness the fixourfood research programme have work with local authority with huge success but the burden must be take off local authority data share challenge should not prevent child from eat the free school meal to which they be entitle as the free school meal scheme be statutory scheme government funding for provide those child with school lunch should already exist so auto enrolment should not be see as extra spending importantly auto enrolment also unlock vital extra pupil premium funding for example since sheffield city council have unlock million in extra pupil premium funding every single year to support child that be just one example of many available include provision in the bill to provide those child with free lunch would have very low cost but an extremely high impact free school meal enable by the new breakfast programme have be show to be beneficial for both attainment and attendance at school in fact the case for universal free school meal be also no brainer impact on urban health find that every invest in universal free school meal return in core benefit that include massive saving for the nhs through reduction in childhood obesity rate the london mayor groundbreake scheme to expand free school meal to all primary aged pupil have also have unprecedented impact of parent say that the scheme have help or significantly help their household finance an evaluation report be recently release encourage the minister for school standards and the secretary of state to read that report if they have not do so already it contain significant finding that more than make the case for universal free school meal to be roll out look forward to see the success of the breakfast club programme as it be roll out alongside hopefully more quality school lunch hope that create further appetite for well and expand school food provision in the future have no doubt that the bill be base on socialist dogma it will reduce choice and competition and take away parent freedom to educate at home be against it will vote against it and government members will vote for it that be how politic work in this country but how on earth can we look at the word child wellbee in the title of the bill and debate and vote on that subject when out there in the country our constituent be talk about what we use to call groom gang although think we have move on to call they mass and gang rape since have try to campaign for more truth and honesty about what have go on although the former labour mp for keighley ann cryer be do that as far back as every attempt at proper national debate on the scale of the problem have be shut down we think initially that in half dozen northern town there be serious problem mass sexual assault and rape of child and young woman however after recent research journalist charlie peters at gb news say that he be certain that this have take place in at least town in our country and be still go on today sincerely thank the hon gentleman for give way appreciate the need to look at these issue in the round but do he accept that there be measure in the bill that will protect child base on what we already know those measure will help stop child across the country be abuse and make it hard for groomer to get access to they which be what we all want be it not hope he agree with no do not whatever measure be in the bill to protect child we all want to see child protect for goodness sake will not protect they the prime minister be do his good to tell we that there have be an inquiry the jay inquiry well there have and it be page long groom gang be not mention once rotherham be literally mention once in pass the scope of that inquiry be like shotgun it be to cover whole range of area in which child be be abuse what we need and be call for be rifle shoot inquiry that look specifically at the question to what extent be gang of pakistani man rap young white girl ultimately it seem to that there be deep racist element behind what happen might be right or might be wrong but do the country not deserve full open and national inquiry believe there be now overwhelming support on all side of the political spectrum for that parliament should not be in denial if the government will not hold it we will raise the money at reform uk and appoint independent arbiter because we need the truth to be out there will vote for the amendment table by the leader of the opposition although note that as women and equalities minister from to she do not meet single victim of the rape and never raise the issue once insincere though the amendment may be we will vote for it however beg labour members to think do their constituent not need to know the truth about this great evil that have happen in our country rise we have more than colleague hop to get in so will implement five minute time limit every year around child in this country be abuse that number be likely high because the vast majority of abuse be hide the bill be about safeguard they it be about stop vulnerable child from fall through the crack for example by have register of those who be home school it be about try to prevent horrific crime such as those commit against sara sharif from ever happen again the children charities coalition have call it major step forward want to be clear that no party have completely clean hand on this issue under successive government vulnerable child have be systematically fail by the institution that be suppose to protect they such as the police social service local authority the crown prosecution service and school they be disbelieve and their life be devalue we in this house owe it to victim and survivor of the past present and sadly future to give they justice and protection where the state fail so badly if we be to do that we can not turn child sexual abuse and exploitation into political football want to be clear that it be by no means all member on the opposition benches who be guilty of do that there have be dedicate powerful advocate for child on both side of the house however the conservative leadership and reform mp march to the beat of elon musk drum be plainly weaponise the pain and trauma of victim for their own political end do not know whether they just do not realise how deeply painful and retraumatise it be for survivor to hear their abuse be speak about so flippantly often in graphic term by people who profess to care but do not act when they have the power to just to bolster their unrelated political agenda or whether they just do not care implore hon member on the opposition benches to stop when they say that child sexual abuse and exploitation be the result of alien culture or multiculturalism project that have fail they mask the reality which be that child sexual abuse and exploitation be happen in every area of this country and be perpetrate by member of every social class every race and every religion reform mp be chuntere on the opposition benches but that be fact and when they deny that they be fail victim and survivor when they say that abuse be import from other culture they imply that abuse be the norm and be okay in some culture towards some victim it never be just as perpetrator be diverse so be their victim if we mask the reality we can not tackle the problem what the vast majority of perpetrator have in common be that they be man of course it be not all man but it be enough man and enough victim for male violence to be national emergency and one that the whole house must commit to end do the hon lady worry like that the recent attempt in the debate to reopen an inquiry be less about support victim and stamp out sexual violence and more about incite racial tension share the hon member concern also take the opportunity to applaud she for her work over many year in this house on the all party parliamentary group for childhood trauma raise the issue before it be politically convenient to do so be thrilled that the bill include measure to help with family cost such as free breakfast club for all primary school child which will boost child wellbee want to see we go far still and provide free school meal for all child the bill also allow the secretary of state to cap the profit of child home provider end the obscene scandal of local authority force to shell out huge sum to private provider finally urge that this ambitious and important bill be back by even further investment in area that will improve child wellbee we need more money for child and adolescent mental health service for child social care and to tackle child poverty be stand up to talk about the important issue of school uniform but will first say that the hon member for nottingham east nadia whittome be quite right to point out that child sexual abuse take place across our society we have just see the archbishop of canterbury and other in the church of england resign over child sexual abuse for the hon member for clacton nigel farage to deny that it affect all aspect of society be frankly for the bird be single parent to two teenager and like many other parent in this place know how many expense be involve in send child to school as they grow and progress through school they require different pair of shoe set of stationery and money for school trip state school should represent level playing field for child of all background where pupil be treat with the same respect and give the same opportunity recognise that school uniform allow pupil to go into school with the same appearance and not be discriminate against or bully for what they wear however school uniform be one of the big cost in send child to school and although welcome the government commitment to limit the number of brand item student be require to have each year more need to be do to support parent during the cost of living crisis when they be already face high energy bill and food cost from my experience of send my daughter to state school brand school uniform item be be sell from monopoly supplier for an inflated price compare with the item buy from high street and charity shop the bill talk about restrict school to three brand item of uniform by the way do not read that as exclude primary school from let kid wear tie the bare minimum of three brand item of jumper polo shirt and skirt for my daughter school cost more than double that from high street shop for family with three child to have two set of three brand item per year cost more than compare with from my local supermarket in frome nearly three time as much that do not even account for sport kit and shoe or for the fact that child often require new item each year as they grow there be also part of my constituency of frome and east somerset that operate three tier school system mean child move around three different school with three different uniform before they be that can mean that parent have to adapt to three totally different uniform colour and requirement we should aim to strike balance between student look smart and not make uniform overly complicated and exclusive the simple the uniform which be base on staple and easily available item and colour the more reusable it be we should foster an environment where school clothe can be easily hand down through family regardless of gender and exchange between family either through the school or through charity shop instead of focus on brand new item for each child that also reduce clothing and textile waste will the minister consider for example why three item be choose rather than one such as school tie or jumper which make student easily identifiable as be from particular school but which leave maximum option for parent to buy the other uniform element from other retailer will she also consider what other additional measure could be take to keep down the cost of uniform kitte out child for new term at school be an expensive business and anything the government can do to support parent in keep those cost down would be most welcome this bill provide we with an important moment for many decade child social care have be overlook an afterthought for government over the past year politician of all colour have too often fail the most vulnerable child in this country the child who be unable to be look after by their own family be delighted that this education secretary and her team have put those child at the heart of this legislation it be testament to her personal commitment to social justice and fairness the statistic on outcome for child in care and the risk of exploitation be well know they represent of the child population but of those in youth justice just of those look after child receive gcse from to compare with the national average of however wish to focus on the child placement estate it be dry topic but if we do not provide sufficient and safe accommodation for these child then the rest be broadly redundant have personal experience of this area before be elect as an mp be barrister often work in child protection law many friday afternoon would be spend in court seek order on an urgent basis for removal of child from their primary carer before the weekend my work would be do once judgment have be give and have draft the order but for my social work team their work have only just begin they would have to collect the child often rely on the police to assist and then often late in the evening the arduous task of attempt to find suitable accommodation for these child would begin they would make call late into the night plead with reluctant foster carer or residential unit to take in these young people who would often sit obediently at the local authority office wait for their fate to be decide have know of time when child sleep on the floor of such office while search be be undertake the lack of sufficient accommodation in this country be complete disgrace the previous government can not say that they be not warn about this in the high court take the unusual step of send judgment to the relevant ministers raise the issue of the lack of appropriate accommodation for such child be just try to find the right place in my speech will my hon friend give way would be very grateful do he agree that provision in the bill for measure such as regional care co operative which would agglomerate service bring they together across local authority to do some of the work of commission recruit and build up child home would help with the problem that he describe my hon friend review which he draw up before be elect to this place contain some of the provision that be now in this legislation so he should be praise for that work as be say the high court raise this issue in it take the unusual step of send judgment to the relevant minister set out the nationwide problem of demand outstrip supply in accommodation for child in care the fact of that case show the human cost of lack of investment and strategy year old girl from family unable to care for she have have different placement in month none be suitable she have repeatedly flee unregulated accommodation unit and be deem to be at serious risk of self harm and sexual exploitation those who have raise the important issue of child sexual exploitation but have show no interest in child care service should hang their head in shame for try to make political capital out of this very very important issue this bill take important step in this regard my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister have already raise the important matter of regional co operation which will certainly add capacity as have be mention there be also the financial backdrop have no doubt that ministers will be make representation to the chancellor about the estimate billion funding gap for local authority in social care but this be not just about money although capacity be undoubtedly require the system also need national and local leadership and national and local strategy there remain despite this very welcome bill lack of comprehensive and national plan for care placement there be lack of an overarching assessment of how this market will fulfil the function necessary in the year and decade ahead bluntly we will still not know what be need and where across the nation and we know from experience that the market will not do it for we we have learn that lesson already we must have an accurate assessment of the need in the sector the type of placement and the number and location of care setting across the country there also need to be funding strategy my private member bill the look after child distance placements bill provide for modest change in this area simply require all local authority to think ahead to have plan for the type of placement that they be able to offer and strategy for where they will need base on an assessment of the demand although there be requirement in the guidance there now need to be statutory responsibility for local authority to think ahead in this area at the moment the issue be about not merely capacity but where the accommodation be more than fifth of child in care live more than mile from their home there be one account of child be place over mile from her community these be young life be separate from their community their brother sister friend and teacher with all the associated damage to their relationship and education and this problem have increase by over since hope the government will properly consider the modest suggestion that local authority should simply have sufficiency plan for where to place these child will briefly touch on one final aspect which be the identifier of child this be useful and important step to safeguard child hope ministers will have discussion on cross departmental basis with the home office as well as the department of health and social care about the development of digital identification and patient passport in those area as well clause which introduce propose new section to the children act on stay close support build on the previous conservative government stable homes build on love strategy in particular refer to the pledge to strengthen the stay close offer and provide statutory basis for it therefore welcome the commitment to this in the bill particularly the requirement of local authority to provide suitable accommodation for formerly look after child well into adulthood at an event last year that have the privilege to co host which be also attend by the under secretary of state for education the member for lewisham east janet daby who be no long in her place we hear from four young people tahir bella william and jess who have all be support by home for good and safe families in support lodging supported lodging be where young person stay with family who provide they with life skill there be more to it can explain another time but those be the basic of it all the young people share powerful story of how live within household have enable they to pursue education and work and give they place to call home and in some case as one describe second family how can support lodging help with the aim of stay close in this bill in october the voices of supported lodgings be publish which have contribution from the four young people whom have mention it find that every stay close support category that be list in the bill have be prove to be provide by support lodging on health and wellbeing of the young people report that support lodging feel like home on relationship have good relationship with their host on education employment and training young people in support lodging be more likely to be in education and employment or training than other care leaver and on participation in society of these young people feel more confident in their ability to live independently let we not forget that these be look after child child who have spend considerable amount of time in care will the government amend the bill to specifically reference support lodging provision as high quality example of the stay close support that local authority could provide for local care leaver and with this will they commit to provide the ability for local authority to develop support lodging in their area through recruitment and the training of host for some young formerly look after people private rent accommodation may be where they wish to live however without family to support they in secure deposit or even act as guarantor will the government seek to extend the role of local authority as corporate parent to require they to facilitate rent deposit and guarantor scheme for look after child also wish to touch on home schooling do not get home school and do not always think that it be the good option but for many it be the choice that they have make for their child but it feel like this bill hammer to crack nut fully appreciate that there be risk of child go miss from education and that home schooling can be use for inappropriate reason but many parent include many constituent who have write to have opt to home educate and be do an excellent job and be deeply concerned about the propose over regulation that they face in the bill too have number of representation from constituent who be concern about the purpose behind these change what additional information do they elicit to the local authority when proper education be be receive do my hon friend agree that some clarity be require there otherwise it just seem an unnecessary and intrusive intervention sometimes those constituent ask question about what the intent be behind the intervention of local authority absolutely agree with my right hon friend the bill be seek detailed explanation from parent of what they be plan to do at home with their child quite frankly it will hinder the work that they be do in educate those child school be probably not readily provide some of that information either be concern by the implication in the bill that the state be well at parenting than parent themselves the change in the bill directly contradict section of the education act which affirm parent legal duty to ensure that their child receive efficient full time education either by regular attendance at school or otherwise that be important because it underscore the principle that parent not the state hold primary responsibility for the education of their child except in the minority of case where there be harm or neglect let we not forget that many parent opt to home school because the state system have fail their child urge caution with the provision in the bill which will add further stress to such parent who have already have to fight long and hard for their child applaud my hon friend for the point that she be make too have have representation from excellent home school parent do she think that there be way with reason and understanding on both side for balance to be strike between the need to safeguard the right of responsible parent to home school their child and the need to prevent the abuse of child by parent who have other more sinister objective my right hon friend be correct there have to be middle ground that we could find suggest that we be use hammer to crack nut lot of these parent be not against have to say something about what they be do but to suggest that they have to give chapter and verse to their local authority which in many case will have fail they already that relationship may well have break down feel like too much of strike will the hon lady give way will make some progress because will not get any extra time for take further intervention the requirement in the bill therefore risk hinder family who for legitimate reason often because of failure in the send provision that they need have opt to educate their child at home have three question for ministers will the government confirm that the evidence base for this part of the bill be found on accurate datum and genuine need which reflect the question ask by my right hon friend the members for salisbury john glen and for new forest east sir julian lewis secondly what assessment have be make of the potential consequence of the bill for home educate family and their ability to provide tailor high quality education and might we inadvertently hinder they in do that thirdly will the government work to protect the right of home educator and prioritise the wellbeing of child over administrative convenience we have hear all sort of contribution this afternoon on many topic but as say in my maiden speech look after child be one of the key thing that wish to speak about believe very strongly in the right of parent to choose what be good for their child really hope that the government will listen to today contribution on both point and that some amendment will be table in the next stage of scrutiny that would tighten up the bill and make for an even well piece of legislation thank my right hon friend the secretary of state for education for bring forward this landmark piece of genuinely transformational legislation as someone who spend three year in the voluntary sector fight for vulnerable child know that the bill prioritise child and their need right many of the wrong of the last year of failure under the conservatives the bill signify much need movement towards preventive service which be shamefully slash by the conservative party sure start with its huge impact on child development disappear youth service be decimate due to the huge cut by the conservative party in england we spend time more on late intervention and spending on early intervention have fall by since the reform lay out today couple with the funding need to realise they properly have the potential to ensure that with the right support more child can remain safely live with their birth family the bill should also ensure that when child need to live with foster parent or in residential home we be able to provide they with the good possible care these child after all be the responsibility of the state we be their parent and we need to have the same high ambition for they as we do for our own child the recognition in the bill that young people need more support when they first leave care must also be celebrate the bill will help to improve the situation by finally extend stay close to all area of the country that be key recommendation of the independent review of child social care that review also recommend extend corporate parenting principle so that they apply not just to child service but to great range of public organisation in november the government outline that that important reform would be implement will the secretary of state confirm that extend corporate parenting responsibility remain part of the government plan to improve support for care leaver we have also hear about the postcode lottery in the help available for care leaver the support that young person receive too often depend on where they live not what they need that be why we need national offer of support which could include thing suggest by the child charity barnardo such as the right to free bus pass free prescription and help with rental deposit like the children commissioner for england believe that the bill present an opportunity for this house to ensure finally that child in england like their counterpart in scotland and wales receive equal protection from assault and battery we can not adequately ensure child welfare if we fail to protect their physical safety and wellbeing review in the lancet of study find that physical punishment have no positive outcome for child and be instead link to great child behaviour problem over time the royal college of paediatrics and child health also find that child who experience physical punishment be time more likely to experience mental health problem and potentially time more likely to experience more serious form of physical abuse these child be also more likely to believe that violence be an acceptable and normal way of express frustration contribute to cycle of violence in society that we need to break though physical punishment may for many of we seem relic of the past datum from find that more than one in five year old have experience physical punishment and the nspcc have see threefold increase in the number of child welfare call mention physical punishment in the past couple of year give that of adult believe that physical punishment be unacceptable the time to end this injustice be now in the context of one child die every four day from deliberately inflict injury and the horrific murder of sara sharif whose father seek to justify her treatment under the dark cloak of discipline it be clear that the threat of violence that child face should no long be give legal cover the bill do so much for child and young people and it be my view that by extend corporate parenting ensure equal protection and establish national care leaver offer we can do even more to ensure that everyone grow up be give the opportunity to flourish give that the opposition amendment have be select will not stand here and outline my disgust at what have happen with regard to the historic groom gang scandal the british people want answer so will ask question of the labour party and several of they will the government commit to deport all guilty foreign national involve urgently include family member who be aware of the crime and therefore complicit wife sister mother and cousin if they know and say nothing be just as guilty as the rapist themselves will the government commit to strip citizenship from dual national implicate and deport they as well race or religion must protect nobody will the government commit to pause all pakistani visa and foreign aid into the country until the pakistani government agree to accept any of their deported citizen who have perpetrate these crime on british soil and imprison these rapist and their accomplice in pakistan however they see fit will the government undertake full investigation into official who have knowledge of these crime yet fail to act specified taskforce to root out this evil should be establish we should not just fire these vile individual but prosecute they how many girl be estimate to have be rap be there tally for the overall number of rape horrifyingly it may well be in the million we just do not know how many vulnerable young girl be estimate to still be involve in these gang if there be no estimate figure why not will regular update be publish detail ongoing prosecution and sentencing will the government publish full nationality breakdown of those convict for such offence along with the location of their crime how many know foreign rapist be there per town per region will the government publish breakdown of the immigration status of those involve on what ground be they in the uk do they have previous conviction how many foreign national find guilty have be release but not deport will the hon gentleman give way will carry on if that be all right how many re offence have occur since release how many of these monster be walk on the same street as the girl they rap and abuse one report suggest that victim come face to face with her rapist in the supermarket be the government comfortable with that how many of the foreign rapist be in receipt of any form of state benefit will the hon member give way will carry on if that be all right how many who be release receive any state benefit how many child have be bear follow rape by those man how many have be give access to the child against the mother wish and how many have use the child as route to remain in the uk will the government commit to prevent that in future how many deportation have be block due to the rapist right to family life or due to other european court of human rights influence will the government set up dedicated confidential and accessible official process for whistleblower to safely raise their concern about foreign rape gang ensure that it be safe secure and easy to find will the government release all court transcript relate to those case so that the british people can understand just part of the horror for themselves how many of those document have be hide due to the cost of release that should not be an obstacle to the transparency of those trial will lifelong sentence be consider for british citizen involve in the crime and for those in position of power who act to cover up the scale of the abuse which politician local and national have knowledge of the event but fail to act again go as far as actively conceal what be truly happen those be the fact that the british people want and deserve to know all those question have also be submit in write form and look forward to receive open and transparent answer the mass rape of young white working class girl by gang of pakistani rapist be rotting stain on our nation this be not about elon musk this be not bandwagon of the far right this be about the victim and ensure that swift and brutal justice be deliver to those demon responsible it be about distinguish between right and wrong will the hon member give way have finish welcome the bill because it address lot of the underlie problem we have in our school and education and indeed in the protection of child welcome the secretary of state commitment to make this child centre bill feel disgusted by what the hon member for great yarmouth rupert lowe have just say can anyone imagine listen to that as victim or survivor be sure his intent be to get to the truth and get justice but the language ask he please to think about who hear our word on november in her letter to the chair of the child safeguard practice review panel the secretary of state for education say the forthcoming child wellbee bill be vital mechanism for improve the life of vulnerable child there be renew government focus on tackle child sexual abuse which will necessarily include our response to the iicsa recommendation want to take this opportunity to ask the secretary of state which of those recommendation fall squarely within the bill hope with cross party support that we can encourage the secretary of state to adopt they the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse publish recommendation try to address the whole of child sexual abuse in this country to get support for those victim and survivor and early intervention to prevent the crime and to get the prosecution we all desperately want recommendation be that there should be core dataset currently the bill single unique identifier number be not the same as core dataset there be need for unified set of datum that allow authority to understand well the prevalence of abuse to identify pattern and to inform evidence base policymaking we have patchy fragmented datum system that hinder effective prevention and intervention iicsa ask for the creation of single core dataset that include the characteristic of victim and allege perpetrator of child sexual abuse vulnerability factor and the setting and context in which the abuse occur recommendation be for child protection authority for england and wales recommendation be for cabinet minister for child protection and that need to be someone who cut across all the different departments because that be where we be fail child right now we do not have join up approach to child protection recommendation be for public awareness campaign and cultural awareness be include throughout the recommendation we need to make child aware of the risk they face but we also need to tackle cultural insensitivity and much bad wherever we find they that be particularly pertinent to because be proud that get the previous government to ensure that every child from primary school have relationship education however in september the department for education publish an independent evidence review on teach relationship education to prevent sexual abuse it find that teacher be still not receive adequate training there be not adequate resource for those teacher so urge the secretary of state to use the bill to do something about that specifically will she ringfence relationship health and sex education training budget fantastic organisation in my south devon constituency call child assault prevention which work with when work for devon rape crisis have to close its door two year ago because its funding be cut by the previous government it be do vital work with primary school child teach they about the danger of sexual assault and how to avoid it would welcome the government look at reinstate funding to such organisation that be work with young child in this sensitive area absolutely echo what the hon member say that work be so important recommendation be on mandatory reporting be keen to hear the home secretary say that it will be one of her objective but it also need to cover those in all position of trust be very concerned that if we have mandatory reporting without the resource for the administration to act on that it become no more than tick box exercise and that the very teacher and training staff who should be protect child get penalise and bad prosecute as consequence iicsa take seven year and cost million it have over million page of evidence and witness over victim and survivor put their trust in the process and give evidence they do all this and we spend all this money so that the recommendation would be implement there be also home office report again spend year of my life put into the home office report in which give the solution spend two year in the iicsa inquiry specifically around groom gang the recommendation have not be adopt say with the deep respect to all those call for national inquiry to instead put all their energy into get the recommendation adopt with the good will in the world you all know be not make party political point another inquiry will mean another year of waiting what want to see and what truly believe we all want to see be child protection right now urge hon member please to consider what they be do and to use report as the time to make the amendment to get the change they want there be two side to the bill indeed it could easily have be two bills and it may have make for strong legislation have it be deal with as two bills commend the government on one aspect which be child wellbee and so much that be part of the bill be good and commendable it be wonderful to see the building up of the work be do on the stay close programme which be already demonstrate positive result and the evidence show the impact it have on people life be delighted to see that much of the work undertake by the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister when he be commission to do the report under the last government have be embrace and be be take as part of it and be build upon be also delighted about the work do on foster and kinship care which we know have such positive impact on the life of so many young people it be good to see that in the bill however the other side of the bill on school be cause for very serious concern the government have say the current discrepancy between maintain school and academy leave potential for inconsistency in education standard opportunity and outcome for pupil from different type of school that be an interesting point look through the clause it seem to be not about drive excellence in our schooling system but about drag the excellent down will take this chance to go through some of those clause and perhaps even the ministers might take the time to familiarise themselves with they clause end academy school freedom on teacher pay the idea that academy school be use that freedom to do anything other than attract the teacher and specialist that they need to get the good for their pupil be crazy some multi academy trust offer term and condition on sick pay after six week that be only little above the statutory minimum if one of their teacher fall seriously ill they should have access to the same protection available to any other teacher the bill remove academy ability to do more for teacher the ark academy trust for example pay its teacher an average of more than every national pay point where academy have area of specialism they have use they as an opportunity to pay more and bring the good teacher in as we progress through the bill clause give the school adjudicator the power the set public admission number for school include academy give local authority great influence over admission number for school in their area in reality that will mean that the very good school lose out on the ability to expand rapidly and offer more child the opportunity to go there that be increasingly important at time when overall student number be start to decline the good school have less opportunity to offer more space to pupil in their community clause repeal the requirement to turn fail local authority school into academy there be already great deal of ambiguity about fail school what will the government do about they that have not be make clear ofsted power have be water down which will mean that fail school continue to exist and there will be no change do my right hon friend agree that ministers must set out how fail school will be tackle we can not have system in which child be leave in school that let they down without immediate action that be what the academy programme seek to address my right hon friend be absolutely correct there be total silence on what will happen there be no sense that where school be fail action will be take to ensure that successful academy trust take over those school and drive improvement what we have hear from the government since they come into office have be about get rid of excellence be very proud of number of the programme that we introduce such as the latin excellence programme or more cadet force in school the evidence point to the fact that those thing have real impact on child attainment and often for child from the most disadvantaged background those programme have just be scrap there be sense that the government want homogeneous school system in which brilliance and excellence and the freedom for teacher and school to deliver the very good for their pupil be stamp out there be sense that minister know good that whitehall be the master and that that will drive our education system forward many aspect of the bill be positive in relation to child wellbee but urge the minister to consider the other aspect that will systemically destroy the progress make by both labour and conservative governments in drive forward academic excellence and in allow state school to offer some of the thing that private school offer which they have not be able to do before at my comprehensive school join cadet force or learn latin be simply not option the bill be about dumbe down it be not about raise aspiration it be not about raise excellence actually the bill will ensure that every child grow up in this country will have the good possible start in life and will break down the barrier to opportunity like the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson go to comprehensive and believe that comprehensive state run education should be excellent that be why support the bill every teacher speak to before the election be cheese off with what be happen in education they be so depressed about what they be do that be one of the reason get involve in this every teacher have speak to who have read the bill support it surely we should be listen to they colleague have mention mental health the government will bring mental health worker into every school that be not in this bill because it be matter for the department of health and social care but it will transform that area the hon gentleman just say that the government would bring mental health worker into every school could he repeat that for the avoidance of doubt that be our manifesto commitment one reason be here be that under the last tory government child in my constituency have to wait six month for treatment follow suicide attempt at school and that be simply not acceptable on the review of the curriculum every teacher have speak to have say that we need to improve the art and music which would in itself improve wellbee rather less controversially will concentrate on clause and the provision of free breakfast club have be gp for the past year and understand that health and education be inextricably link we can not learn when we be hungry free breakfast club will ensure that every child irrespective of their background have the foundation they need to start the day there be strong evidence that obesity be massive problem harm the wellbeing of our child some of child enter reception be obese and in year be obese free breakfast club will reduce those number in stroud we have be work really closely with local primary school to get nutritious local food into the school diet not rely on national company to do so we have commitment to try to procure of that food from the local agricultural community be very proud of that and keen to encourage it another point about breakfast club be that it be really important that child eat together that be what we use to do at our primary school it foster feeling of wellbeing and the long table in stroud be an organisation that encourage that we need to be careful of the food industry lobby which be incredibly powerful and have be provide free food for breakfast club all would say be that there be no such thing as free breakfast company be try to promote their own product and we must be very wary of they there be quite lot of evidence that free school meal reduce obesity and would support their universal roll out not just in wales and london in london there have be reduction in obesity level as well as improvement in learning so let we work towards that when condition allow in the interim we should go for auto enrolment for free school meal which would improve funding for school and enable about child to receive those meal conclude by commend the government for commit to ensure that every child have the opportunity to thrive the bill be bold step towards address inequality and improve the life of the next generation by introduce free breakfast club this government be not only tackle hunger but invest in health and education as such urge my hon friend not to get waylay by the political thing that be go on around this bill it be an excellent bill and we need to support it rise to ensure that as many colleague as possible can get in and that not many be disappoint by not get in we be go to reduce the speak limit to four minute call vikki slade thank you madam deputy speaker will go as quickly as can because have time my speech to five minute the death of sara sharif shock we all as my hon friend the member for woking mr forster say before recess we have the opportunity to change the law so that her legacy be to be the last vulnerable child to be kill by people who should have look after she official report december vol we often recall the name of victoria climbié and baby peter connelly but so many more child and baby have be the innocent victim of evil parent and family member neglectful professional and siloe system their memory should be etch on our heart as we consider this bill welcome the move in part of the bill to strengthen the multi agency approach but agree with the children commissioner and the hon member for lowestoft jess asato that we should go far in protect child from assault some of the injury inflict on child such as sara sharif under the guise of reasonable punishment have be beyond belief but if reasonable punishment be not define in law that must make it very difficult for some social worker to take the appropriate action have be shock by just how many of the child death report be of baby infant who have not reach school or nursery and whose voice be literally unheard worry that the role of the health visitor in the life of new parent have be so greatly reduce as new mum would join other parent at regular weigh in session and playgroup alongside health visitor right through to when my child start nursery gps in my constituency of mid dorset and north poole have tell that they would previously liaise with the health visitor in their surgery to warn family who be at risk perhaps mum have come in for smear test and they be worried about domestic abuse or father have come in and they be worried about alcohol abuse they could send the health visitor in and check up on those family but that do not happen any more thank to the smashing of the system under the previous government turn to the school part of the bill be sorely disappointed that it lack anything to support child with special educational need and disability there be no requirement for school to be inclusive of such child and nothing about the need for teacher to be train in autism or social and emotional health previously when challenge the minister have urge more action and have be tell to wait for this bill but if there be an ofsted judgment it would be require improvement when my child be push out of school unable to cope full time and obviously not go to achieve the heady height of five gcse and attendance we seriously consider home education to hear your child say mum they do want here break your heart the lack of accountability in academy be just not okay so welcome the move to bring academy more under the control of local authority home education be right of parent and it can be transformational for some child my constituent katie who choose to educate her child at home have raise concern about school refer family to social service if they indicate their wish to move to home education will the minister confirm that it will not be possible for school to refer family simply because they choose to opt out there be also concern about the risk to parent flee domestic abuse when the other parent do not have any involvement because under this bill the register require permission from both parent and will list both parent which simply would not be possible in that situation if that mean that single parent family be exclude that be simply not okay finally there be an opportunity to properly support family for whom school do not work propose new section on page of the bill talk about support but provide none we need parent to have the ability to access the national curriculum free resource and free examination there be so many fantastic provision in this bill that it be quite hard to know where to start however the first thing want to say be that the move to restrict the number of brand school uniform item will know be so welcome by parent in my congleton constituency so many of they who have speak to be struggle and find it really very difficult to make end meet as they have do for many year have speak to parent who be work two job and desperately try to put food on the table know that those parent will also strongly welcome the provision of free breakfast club have speak to the secretary of state about the importance of child with special educational need be able to access those breakfast club and holiday provision know she look at that in the pilot of free breakfast club and we will continue to emphasise it the other thing would like to mention about free breakfast club be toothbrushe which we certainly talk about during the general election believe there be pilot for toothbrushe in breakfast club and would love to see that roll out widely toothbrushing be so crucial and work parent who drop child off early of course find it difficult to ensure that their child tooth be brush before school it be well do every day so would welcome our extend that as far as possible my favourite thing about the bill be that it really demonstrate our commitment to all the child in our community in all school have the good possible opportunity both because it be morally imperative and because the education of today be the national productivity of the workforce tomorrow we all have to keep that in the front of our mind and know that the minister absolutely do would like to say one or two thing about the identifi system we be bring in with this bill many colleague have refer to some horrific situation that this seek to avoid and to the position of child who be outside school want to reassure parent in my constituency that those who have choose to home school absolutely have my support this be not about penalise parent who make that choice or about restrict freedom of choice it be about protect child who be already identify as extremely vulnerable know that everyone here support that or would hope they do want to mention the use of the single identifier to track the potential educational outcome of child in temporary accommodation have speak before in this house of my significant concern about how when child lose their accommodation they often lose their school place and may spend considerable period outside the education system some child lose their accommodation repeatedly during their childhood and therefore move school on multiple occasion think the capacity to track that and to track the outcome for those child be really important that be hugely important power in the bill and hope we will use it in that way lastly thank everyone for the intelligent and constructive point they have make today and the liberal democrats for their constructive support for the bill there be other in the house who really could learn from their example my interest in this all start when become governor of the second school ever to become an academy back in the late then spend some time with the former director of public prosecutions on improve the practice of prosecute rape gang and child sexual abuser in the early what all that demonstrate to be that much will revolve around the quality of the professional practice that the bill lead to rather than what we put into law in this parliament we can debate many thing that we want to see improve but it be important that we recognise and thank the social worker police officer and medical staff who currently ensure that we in the uk have one of the most effective and safest child protection system of any nation in the world it be important to acknowledge that as many member have say there be much in the bill that conservative members will welcome for example the implementation of family group decision making build on the family group conferencing model and the work to build on the success that virtual headteacher have have in drive up attainment and ensure that child in care be now among the good school attender of any group of child in our country be to be commend in particular in the case of propose new section on bring partnership together the work together guidance that be last update in will have to do lot of heavy lifting to ensure that the aspiration we set out work in practice particularly in respect of education the main purpose of the bill be to create responsibility for local authority to bring education to the table but it do not go so far as to create duty or obligation on school nursery and childminder to participate reciprocally that have be an issue for long time in our system it be an issue with area child protection committee local safeguarding child board and local safeguarding partnership so we must ensure that we get it right will minister ensure that the guidance make clear to school leader governor and trust that they have an obligation to ensure that they fully commit to and participate in those local safeguarding arrangement have two final and important point first entirely agree with the point make by the hon member for lowestoft jess asato ask the deputy prime minister about end the reasonable chastisement defence in law and although understand it be matter of home office legislation be astonish to hear the secretary of state for education say that she be open minded about the issue would like clear assurance from the government that they will respond to those call and that we will ensure that we close that loophole for good for child such as dwelaniyah robinson and sara sharif whose death have occur with people try to justify violence on the basis that it be reasonable punishment we must ensure that all child enjoy equal protection in our country finally let turn to the call for national inquiry the prime minister say in response to question this afternoon that he be open minded about that and the safeguarding minister have say the same thing those of we with experience will know that when we look at publicly available serious case review all of which we can read on the nspcc website we see that these case be often complicated there be groom gang and there be also drug gang of people who be both abuse and abuser who coerce boy into sexual activity there be schoolteacher and clergyman who carry out this activity we must ensure that although certain group of victim and perpetrator may be in the headline we recognise the diversity and complexity of this issue if we be to deal with it effectively it sadden to make this contribution three main aspect of the bill be of particular concern to the proposal to make it compulsory for academy to teach the national curriculum the harmonisation of teacher pay across academy and maintain school and the pathway for future fail school when be elect in two of our four secondary school be in the bottom perform of school in london and london be the bad region in the country today we have three academy harris academy merton harris academy morden and st mark academy and be delighted to tell the house that they be all ofsted rat outstanding wish to thank the principal julian sparks aisha samad hannah fahey and their team for all their effort accord to ofsted late inspection report one of the key to the success of harris academy merton be its aspirational version of our national curriculum that be flexible and tailor to pupil individual need ofsted state that teacher at the academy be able to carefully consider what pupil need to learn and the right time for pupil to revisit that knowledge that be proven recipe for success not just at harris academy merton but in academy across england struggle to see how remove the right to carefully tailor education will benefit student who need the additional support that such an education provide force school such as harris academy to teach the national curriculum risk undermine one of the key to their success have serious concern about the proposal to change the pathway for turn around fail school know from bitter personal experience that any change to the status of school can become highly political the current system in which fail school automatically become academy provide clarity and de politicisation and ensure rapid transition fear that make that process discretionary would result in large increase in judicial review pressure on council and prolonged uncertainty which be in nobody interest understand that change might be need to ensure that fail school be take over by the right academy for their need and not by weak academy and there should be list of those academy that be not up to it but we should not put the process at risk my contribution be bear of year experience have fight teach union and anti academy group because the most important thing be the ability of child to achieve not our aspiring to that and say that what we want but put the structure in place that actually bring that about do not put that at risk will vote for the reason amendment and against the bill not only because of the catastrophic damage that the bill will do to the academy movement as so amply explain by the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh but because it fail to take the opportunity for national public inquiry dedicate to the child rape and groom scandal yes victim and survivor want action now but they also want answer fear that there be great misunderstanding and misinformation about the previous national inquiry lead by professor jay that be an all encompass umbrella inquiry on child sex exploitation do the hon member agree that there be two year inquiry on organise network and sexual exploitation which be groom gang in the language of inquiry the chief executive of the national association for people abuse in childhood say we urge the government to focus on deliver improvement rather than propose new inquiry that may potentially delay action even far shall come to the hon lady point but the reality be that professor jay inquiry be an overarch one and its reference to groom gang be minuscule it mention only rotherham but we know that there be dozen of town primarily labour lead town where horrific thing have take place victim and survivor want not only action but answer this be an opportunity for both the hon lady refer to the need for action but surely in this great nation of ours we can ensure both in parallel we can say yes these action be require follow the recommendation of the jay inquiry but alongside that for continue public confidence and to get the answer that victim and survivor want we need to keep explore in specific town the inquiry the hon gentleman seek be part of the overarch inquiry there be separate inquiry one of they last two year and result in page report that be specific about groom gang what more information do we need we know who the perpetrator be we know the model and we know the victim what we want be prosecution and support for the victim the hon lady be quite right that the victim and survivor where we know they want answer action and prosecution but regret to say that there be many town where people do not know the perpetrator and the truth have not be expose the reality be that many council have vested interest in not dig into the truth because it will expose the failing of their councillor and officer that be why we must have national inquiry dedicate to this horrific issue we should be ambitious and say that it do not need to take three five or seven year for heaven sake let we do it in one year and get it do let we have the appropriate number of people inquire into town after town examine the result and get the answer that be what will restore the confidence of the british people action immediately and answer within year or so surely as nation we can do this first meet my constituent claire throssell at remembrance service at my old secondary school in penistone every year the headteacher mark the death of claire son former pupil jack and paul sykes who die at the hand of their father know to be domestically abusive in house fire that he start while on permit contact visit the name of most of the child who have be murder at the hand of their domestically abusive parent in the decade since claire boy be kill remain unspoken but we must not forget they woman aid research find that between and child include jack and paul have be kill as result of unsafe contact with abusive parent those child have to remain nameless to avoid cause further distress to their family many more death will have follow uncounted and unrecalled the number of child at risk may be on an even high scale in the year to march in england and wales child in need social care case assessment identify that either child or parent be experience domestic abuse one name be sadly know to we only too well sara sharif her tragic death make the need for action on this issue all the more poignant the sentencing of her murderer have take place just before christmas the bill will help protect child like sara it will create safe high quality education system for every child and will introduce register of child who be not in school to help ensure that no child fall through the gap when home educate our government be take strong action in response to sara death through the bill establishment of single unique identifier for child and the introduction of new duty that will improve information sharing across and within agency bring together multi agency child protection team from education social work and the police commend the secretary of state for education for bring forward bill so transformative of child protection and so powerful in strengthen regulation on the use of agency worker in child social care my constituent claire throssell promise she two boy that no other child would die in the same tragic circumstance be proud that our mission lead government have mission to halve violence against woman and girl in decade and recognise the need to use every government tool available to target perpetrator and address the root cause of abuse and violence achieve this mission and fulfil the promise that claire make to her child will require we to connect the incredible strategic work in the bill with the urgent need to change the law to remove the family court presumption in favour of contact this principle add via the children and families act to the children act allow known abuser to have contact with their child put their life at risk will the hon lady give way no will make progress the bill will implement child centre government emphatically embed it in education and child social care and there must be parallel work to put child first in the family court that important piece of the jigsaw puzzle will complement the bill commend the bill to this house it take landmark approach to safeguard child at risk and be proud to support it pay tribute to the hon member for rotherham sarah champion for all the work that she have do on child sexual abuse want to speak on two limited measure in the bill first the registration of child not in school positive measure that build on the work of the previous government and secondly the clause on teacher training we know from our casework that the measure on register be positive and will play big role in ensure that child be not lose or hide in the system in implement and apply the measure urge the government to consult with sen charity and organisation particularly organisation work with autistic kid and family ambitious about autism make the case that the register should contain more datum on the profile of child not at school disaggregate by primary need it be vital for autistic child and family that we put on clear foot the expectation that there will be detailed profile datum so that school and council can offer more tailored support in get they back to school child with pathological demand avoidance require completely different approach when it come to negotiate school entry and we must ensure that their need be meet with patience and understanding my right hon friend will be aware that although many home educate child with autism be know to local authority there be very poor support for they how will this burdensome expensive register it will be even more expensive if he have his way transform the support that child need rather than be just another bureaucratic exercise that continue the current woeful level of support thank my right hon friend for that intervention but make clear my support for the register the other aspect to have more rule and regulation for family of autistic child be the inadvertent risk of penalise those family through fine and the imposition of strict rule which will obviously add to the harm and stress that they often face urge ministers and civil servant to reflect on that why should those parent be fin if they be do all they can to get their child into school even more problematic be the fact that for autistic kid the clear firm and harsh rule even with all the good intent that believe there be can add further trauma and make school entry even more difficult that already happen with registration school be rightly under pressure from government to ensure that child get to school on time however parent of autistic child particularly with pda profile have do amazingly well to get their child to the school gate at all and the total focus on registration at certain time of day at all cost risk school refusal and ultimately child miss education both ambitious about autism and the children commissioner report on support for autism and other condition argue that much well understanding of the different aspect of autism be key to get child back to school at the heart of this matter be parent time after time parent of autistic child be judge and challenge because school and authority assume that the issue be behaviour or bad parenting or that the issue have very simple cause make sure the measure in the bill have deep understanding of what those family and kid be go through be absolutely vital the teaching measure will help again point to the work of the previous government support by the autism society make positive stride to introduce autism training in initial teacher training the more that individual teacher training programme have specific model about different aspect of autism and challenge to school entry and the more that can be do on continuous professional development for all staff teacher administration staff and receptionist be key autism be often at the centre of school refusal and non attendance as the bill progress through the house and into implementation look at these measure with the autistic child front of mind will not only transform the school experience of child and family but in my view help address the core goal of the measure to improve school attendance will the right hon gentleman give way sorry be pleased to speak in support of the bill and wish to speak to the cost of living impact it begin to address every child matter not just political guidance but an ideal to live by and to come into politic for therefore welcome the first step that the bill represent step towards change in the security and fortune of all young people in bury and britain ensure the wellbeing of child and the whereabouts of child in bury north have be one of my main priority as an mp it be also why have long champion both in this parliament and in my previous time in this place improvement to the appalling state of the special educational need system child wellbeing or their vulnerability do not exist in vacuum it be tie to the condition they grow up in in bury north we confront grim reality of child in bury north be live in absolute poverty poverty must no long simply be glance at by our politic we must reach into it it be concentrated poverty dense multiple and compound will my hon friend give way will not it be poverty that have creep up on we fast and fast in recent year where one mile difference between postcode can mean as much as seven year gap in life expectancy it show itself in poor squalid housing too few teacher in school lack of accessible public or social service an absence in quality public transport the scourge of antisocial behaviour victim of unpunished criminality and even bad street than the well off ward be rightly animate by worse still be the poverty of opportunity with child unaccounte for or not attend school at all strongly support the bill first move to ease the burden face by so many family by cut the cost of child go to school common sense on school uniform will save parent more than child on the back to school shop free breakfast club for all primary school child will save hard press parent up to year per child critically that can help work parent to make their hour the ambition of the government go well beyond what the bill start eye and expectation will turn to the child poverty taskforce and its recommendation as well as the future work of this parliament we need to tackle the root of these experience not just the symptom the government be determined to transform the life of child with structural strategic change to life in bury and britain it have be do before sure start the building schools for the future programme the maintenance allowance the power of progressive social policy the importance of the first day of child life foundation learning and yes phonic and choice we will not let the inheritance from the conservative party stop we this will be period of renewal and hope bury north poor be fail by live down the road from those do just all right another town overlook and underserve by fund formula that have only ever glance at the place and its problem and by the failure to level up let alone even out let we be clear the bill be only the beginning good start we must keep go because every child matter it be pleasure to take part in the debate let begin with the question of the need for national inquiry into the rape groom gang give what have be say so far challenge colleague who have oppose the inquiry to name single proposal from the jay report that can not be implement if we go ahead with it it really be matter of and notwithstanding the political theatre that labour members have try to bring to the debate the fact that both the prime minister and the safeguarding minister have say that they be open minded suggest that sensibly from policy point of view and politically the labour party may move to the correct position as be point out by my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson this be bill in two part which could probably most usefully have be two separate bills the first half concern safeguarding and for the most part my party and support it the second concern school and that we most certainly can not support rather than accuse our amendment of be wreck amendment as the liberal democrats have rather disappointingly do they should recognise that the second half of the bill the school element be the wreck element because it make the important safeguarding improvement part of bill that can not be genuinely support in this house there be troubling theme misguided notion that the bureaucrat know well as colleague have suggest for instance the proposal to strip academy of the flexibility to set competitive pay for their staff if the government be genuinely interested in the levelling up that have just be refer to by the hon member for bury north james frith why not as sir dan moynihan perhaps the nation most successful headteacher and trust runner say at lunch time today give those academy freedom to maintain school why rip away the element that have be use by academy to produce school such as michaela which be the good in the country we have an ideologically drive labour government that certainly apply to those on the front bench would not want to daub everyone behind the front bench with the same description who can not even bring themselves to congratulate school that have be the good in the country for three year in row the government be signal that they do not trust school to attract and retain the good teacher and trust only the secretary of state to do so in advocate for new school to be open and control by local authority they remove the contestability notwithstanding some of the contradiction in the secretary of state speech she do describe competition as harmful represent beverley and holderness and for many year look at school in hull where there be view express sotto voce that it be the people here who be the problem generation after generation be fail and when the academy programme be expand in what happen we see primary school leave local authority control en masse we see that it be no long acceptable for local authority to use its democratic mandate to give substandard education to the local population we see transformation we see academy group open up and teacher and community seize that can not believe that labour members really want to tear this away when the evidence be crystal clear from the oecd pisa table on any measure english education have become immensely well rise may not believe that of the labour party generally but would believe it to be possible of the hon gentleman the right hon gentleman be make various remark about what he consider to be the failing and deficiency of this excellent bill may invite he to reflect on the fact that in my constituency east leeds family and child have be really struggle over the last decade the measure in the bill to bring down the cost of school uniform and provide free breakfast club in primary school should be warmly welcome and support by all of we who care about child and family in our community no one can be against the principle of breakfast club and effort to make sure that family do not have excessive charge impose on they by school although we need to look at the specific that have nothing to do with what be say ask the hon gentleman and indeed other labour members to reflect on the speech make by the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh chair the education committee from to and she and the hon member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin who be on the front bench be distinguish member of that committee and as be my right hon friend of course do not think that anyone with whom have be in this house over the last year have more personal and visceral record of fighting for change in their constituency than the hon member for mitcham and morden colleague should consider that before they go into committee and have the opportunity to reflect on the change in this legislation because she know of what she speak she have be heroic in champion the improvement in education in her area and she have deliver it welcome this bill because it be chance to make progress on reset the child social care system in england and that be where will focus my remark child social care be special endeavour it be collection of kin professional and volunteer who seek to provide safe stable and love home for child right across our country they be the most important foundation for any child grow up the foundation of family of tribe and of sense of identity have chair the independent review of child social care commission by the last government have have the opportunity to spend time listen to thousand of people with direct experience of the system and to make number of recommendation on which believe the legislation put forward today will deliver one be about shift away from late stage crisis intervention and another be about create sharp focus on more expert lead child protection system my other recommendation include unlock the potential of family network as an alternative to the care system and move away from care system that break rather than build lifelong love relationship as somebody who have lead an independent review for the government that look at serious matter which include engage with and speak to victim of sexual abuse and criminal abuse find it extraordinary that people who be send to parliament to be problem solver be use this debate to be problem exploiter instead we have stack of evidence we have have thousand of victim of sexual abuse provide heartbreaking and very painful evidence and testimony over many year and it be our job to listen and to act not to exploit at moment when the politic may be in our favour in my constituency of camborne redruth and hayle of secondary school child be persistently absent from school some be home school but some be lose to the system without support these be vulnerable child this bill be about protect vulnerable child do my hon friend agree that vote against this bill be play politic with the protection of vulnerable child completely agree have huge amount of respect for the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds who share his comment while ago but if he and other members be serious about this matter they would table amendment to deliver on iicsa recommendation not to go through the process again will speak briefly about three particular measure in the bill first it be welcome that we have proposal for family group decision make to be make compulsory at pre proceeding stage because there be very sound evidence that it work randomised control trial undertake few year ago show that if family group decision making in the form of family group conference be provide at pre proceeding stage across england few child would enter care each year and it would free up million for early support for family as local authority start to deliver on the new requirement it be extremely important that we do not just make it tick box exercise and that we ensure that the evidence and practice guidance be there to support local authority to deliver in way that will be most effective secondly the bill will create multi agency child protection team these team will fuse together at an operational level rather than just strategic level the relevant agency need to share information and then act on it to protect child from significant harm it be important that as well as get the structure right we focus on the professional expertise require to do the task of child protection which be often so challenging we too often leave newbie social worker with the most challenging task of assess significant harm by themselves we do not ask the police to do that we often send police officer out in pair and it be important that we support social worker on their route to expertise through the early career framework so that the most expert be make these challenge judgment on significant harm know ministers be look at that unique child identifier be long overdue call for this in my review as have number of other reviewer again welcome the leadership that this government have show in act on this in their first six month it may sound like modest technical change but if it be deliver well it will blow away the fog of confused and partial information sharing encourage ministers to look at the think family database in bristol which be great example of what can be do when child level datum be share by the police education child service and health finally the introduction of regional co operative arrangement will allow for bold action to ensure that we have the foster carer we need in this country last year household express an interest in become foster carer but we have approve only of they calderdale council take the innovative step of give foster carer council tax break which have be incredibly effective in recruit foster carer would this and other such idea be good way to get more people into the system completely agree that we need to do an awful lot more to support the recruitment and retention of foster carer minister have show reform zeal with this measure to provide the secretary of state with power to create regional care co operative across the country if the bill be pass urge ministers to use this new power at pace and with boldness so that we can create the extra foster home we need if we follow the example of really effective foster agency in the voluntary sector we could approve new foster carer each year rather than the we approve at the moment welcome these transformational change and commend the government for introduce the bill so early look forward to support its passage declare my interest as former director of the new schools network as such have work with many great free school and academy leader be enormously proud of the huge improvement in english school over the last year in primary school english child be the good reader in the west the pisa ranking show that we be in the world for math up from under labour in science up from under labour and in read up from under labour in response to various debate and question the education secretary have make it clear that she do not really like these statistic but the same story be tell by the progress in international reading literacy study and the trend in international mathematic and science study it be shame that ministers can not bring themselves to celebrate this success story or even to congratulate the leader of the good school in the country katharine birbalsingh of the michaela community school fact be very inconvenient when minister be so ideological about education the magic formula behind this success be one champion by tony blair david laws and all of we on the conservative benches today the formula be freedom accountability and evidence of what work through this bill and other measure the government be unfortunately take sledgehammer to each of these principle new free school have be cancel the trust capacity fund have go and fund for school that be plan to academise have be take away and this bill be about to reverse academy freedom restore the power of council bureaucrat and replace innovation with ideological uniformity the clarity of ofsted accountability have be ruin standard attainment test in primary school be in danger and with they school accountability and progress datum will go on the evidence base this government be anti datum anti fact and indeed anti evidence as we have hear during the debate there have be attack on synthetic phonic math mastery knowledge rich curriculum teacher lead instruction and traditional academic subject we have hear some member explicitly reject the concept of academy and demand state run school there be denial of the scientific evidence behind what have work from the neurological knowledge we now have about how child learn to the work of hirsch on cultural literacy and the confirmation that high level skill be dependent on the automatic mastery of low level activity the bill be base not on what work but on what we know do not work do my hon friend share my hope that government members will follow the example of the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and put the bill under genuine scrutiny share my right hon friend admiration for the speech give by the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh it be incredibly powerful and hope member on the labour front bench listen closely to what she say even if they be not listen to right now they be look at their phone the government have make deliberate decision to dismantle everything that have work how do the hon gentleman respond to the situation under the current system whereby third of young people fail to get good gcse in english and math and we have the most unhappy young people in the oecd invite the hon lady to look at the study that compare english school with those in other country internationally and within the united kingdom the pisa statistic show that the most disadvantaged student in england have the same outcome as average pupil in wales but the government seem to be base their policy on the welsh system invite she to look at the evidence even if ministers will not my interest be pique by the hon gentleman description of labour members as be anti datum he talk about the welsh education system have he review the argument make by professor john jerrim who conduct the review of the england pisa result and find that there be an anomaly with the treatment of welsh language test that if correct would significantly boost wales place in the pisa ranking share several hour twice weekly with the hon gentleman when we serve on the employment rights bill committee his creativity in defend the indefensible be admirable in that committee as it be today on top of the thing have already list measure in the bill before we will make thing yet bad include the compulsion to follow the national curriculum which be about to be weaken by the review by becky francis and the removal of freedom on pay and condition the education secretary have today fail to explain how she will meet the commitment she make to avoid cut pay for some teacher in addition ministers be grant themselves unspecified power to direct academy in future think we know what that might mean the bill and the other change introduce by this government be deliberate act of ideological vandalism standard will fall as result child will suffer and the legacy of the education secretary will be the provision of case study in what do not work in education this be an extremely welcome bill that address some long stand issue in social care and education there be much need measure to ease the capacity pressure on foster service by offer family group decision making and require all council to publish kinship offer there be very welcome measure for hard press family on school uniform and free breakfast club on behalf of care leaver be pleased to see the focus on stay close which offer vital support in the transition from be in care to leave care it be very much maslow hierarchy of need issue unless young people have the basic in place it be very difficult to focus on move forward in my limited time want to mention three measure that be particularly pleased with there be around child currently be educate at home parent choose that route for number of reason and be comfortable that in most case the decision to home educate be take with the child good interest in mind however there be those who choose to home educate when difficult question start to be ask by concerned professional who be in regular contact with the child as foster carer of year have see the consequence of those family manage to avoid the spotlight for far too long by move house move school and avoid scrutiny the bill be therefore immensely positive for those particularly vulnerable child it will mean that authority will know where child be and they can be well monitor through the creation of the register child go through section action can have an application to be educate at home refuse by the local authority it be worth say however that parent who be home educate child with no issue have nothing to be concern about hear the secretary of state say that just yesterday the bill address the exorbitant fee be charge by some of the large child placement provider be at the national social care conference in november when at almost every plenary debate and presentation someone would mention the statistic that the large provider of child placement collectively make million in profit in that be all off the back of the taxpayer all pay through our local authority and they feel it the public have feel it as well because there be simply less money to go around for everything else derbyshire county council spending on look after child rise from million in to million in that growth in spending be unsustainable and be divert precious resource away from the child who be most in need of support and into the pocket of shareholder therefore welcome the fact that the bill require large child placement provider to give regular financial information to newly create financial oversight scheme and give the government the power if necessary to cap the profit of child home provider and independent foster agency will my hon friend give way on that point can not because have to go to delegated legislation committee in minute apologise also welcome the fact that the bill enable the creation of new local authority school under the previous government new school be require to be academy or free school and that policy be base on ideology rather than evidence end that requirement will mean that when new school be build they can be open by the provider well suit to meet the need of the local community end the restriction will also ensure that when school fail broad range of measure can be take to give school the support they need to succeed there be broad range of positive in the bill they may not realise it yet but the future of our most vulnerable child have just become little bright as father of three little girl find much to welcome in the bill part speak to improve child social care and particularly support the provision on accommodation for look after child the whole country be sadden and shock by the murder of surrey child sara sharif sadly there be other story in surrey that also need to be hear jennifer chalkley from bookham in my constituency start college in september she be and have be diagnose with autism and adhd one month later she be dead from suicide last year her coroner conclude that her death be avoidable it have be multi agency failure include failure by the child family and lifelong learning department at surrey county council accord to the coroner report to ensure that jennifer education health and care plan contain sufficient and update information about her risk of suicide oskar nash another surrey child with autism be when he walk on to railway line near egham in january last year his coroner conclude that his death be avoidable again it be multi agency failure include failure by the child family and lifelong learning department at surrey county council again accord to the coroner report to ensure that oskar educational health and care plan contain sufficient information about his suicidal thought then there be sara sharif who be murder in by her father and stepmother the executive director at the child family and lifelong learning department at surrey county council dismiss any accountability say in statement that the perpetrator go to extreme length to conceal the truth from everyone there be bruise and burn mark and report of child be punch all over her body there be report over year to sara school and to social service how be that go to extreme length to conceal the truth from anyone thank my hon friend and all other in the house who have mention my constituent sara sharif today do he agree that the provision in the bill that would not just encourage but force local authority to share that datum could have save sara from woking and could save vulnerable child go forward pay tribute to my hon friend as sara mp for raise the horror that have take place of course agree that datum sharing between public authority be vital to ensure that such case do not happen again but it be not enough and alone it will not prevent the catastrophic and systematic negligence of surrey county council this be the same department that have the high number of statutory breach relate to child report to the local government and social care ombudsman for over two year the department cover information up from its own county council and scrutiny committee for more than month and only disclose it when my five liberal democrat surrey mp colleague and publicly call it out surrey county council objectively contribute to the death of jennifer chalkley oskar nash and sara sharif by ignore exist legislation be grateful to my hon friend for give way especially during such powerful and meaningful speech one of my constituent whom shall refer to as claire in order to protect her identity be only year old and have attempt to take her own life time her desperate mother have have to take surrey county council to tribunal time to try to secure the appropriate educational therapeutic and social care that she need do my hon friend agree that while we welcome the tightening of legislation present in the bill it be only as good as the willingness and ability of school and council to implement it fully agree with my hon friend surrey county council fail to abide by exist legislation so how on earth be we mean to believe that new legislation alone will be enough share his concern about claire know from my constituent that there be child in surrey who be at risk right now that be why be speak today this morning jennifer chalkley mother sharon texte to say even though you do get to meet jen her story be powerful one and need share to save other young life raise jen to be the change you want to see in the world and she still do this reply she will be ask the house to consider this be this bill alone enough to save our child life or do the child family and lifelong learning department at surrey county council also need root and branch reform immediately thank the hon member for dorking and horley chris coghlan for his moving contribution member on the opposition benches should be ashamed to defend the status quo the current system have see one third of young people be fail they leave the system feel like failure because they have not achieve the basic qualification of decent gcse in english and math to be able to progress with their life we have the unhappy young people in the oecd and when we speak to young people they tell we that their experience in the education system be significant contributor to that feeling of unhappiness and the mental health crisis that they face the legacy of the previous government be that home education which have only recently be properly count year on year have rise in the last month from to but post covid it have probably double or triple that reflect the fact that the system be not work for far too many parent because it be not inclusive and do not meet their need and the change to the curriculum have limit young people who have different ability be able to prove their strength and be value in the classroom that be not to mention the failure in send and the urgent change that we know that we need to meet the significant support need of some young people challenge the defence of the exist system make by my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh the huge improvement in london be not just base on academisation we can look at evidence such as the research that be do follow the london challenge strategy multiple factor contribute to the great gain that london make but when we have try to replicate they outside london in genuinely the most deprived part of this country we have not see the same gain have see academy trust after academy trust take on fail school with the most vulnerable child in our country and fail to make the improvement that it desperately deserve that be why we need to think differently and bring forward new reform to make genuine difference in community that do not have the other advantage that somewhere like london do my experience of tackle educational disadvantage in the most disadvantaged community be that when we take place base approach the reality of competition incentivise school in some part of an area to off roll and not be inclusive because if they want to seek an outstanding rating from ofsted the good way to do that be to get rid of the more difficult child if they just implement the michaela approach child with autism and other more complex need do not thrive in the same way within those structure and requirement parent therefore have to take they out of the school either because they see their child mental health issue and choose to or because the school force they to do so that have to change which be why welcome the reform that the government be bring forward the evidence show that education be the primary determinant of where child fall on the income distribution relative to their parent that be why truly believe that education need to be put back at the heart of our national life as the bill provide for if we be to ensure that barrier to opportunity be break down for all the bill take huge step towards that and be proud that child interest be be return to the heart of government policy that be why be proud to support the bill ensure the safety and success of child in our school be one of the most important responsibility that we have as policymaker by extend regulation and inspection to include more school we be create safe environment for our child and give they the good chance to thrive the bill introduce improve analysis of school facility particularly for child with special educational need and disability which be much need measure the change will ensure that every child have access to an environment where they can learn and grow in safety and in comfort however while these measure be welcome it be equally important that we ensure that the current system as well as any future one be both effective and efficient it be vital that school teacher and most importantly child be not leave wait for the resource and support that they need the case of dorset studio school which serve not just my constituent in west dorset but student across the county illustrate the urgent need for the system to deliver result quickly dorset studio school provide exceptional support for student but especially for the of its pupil with special educational need three time the national average the quality of the education that the pupil receive be despite the fact that the school operate in facility that be not fit for purpose it have no hall no canteen and no specialist teaching area the split campus layout and cramped classroom make it impossible to provide the individualised support that child need particularly those with physical disability in february fund for the school new campus be approve the project be set to merge its two site into one modern campus however since then progress have stall with delay in release the fund from the treasury and the department for education the bill will extend the check necessary for safeguard our child to more school but we must be mindful of delay and how they negatively impact those we be try to protect the bill rightly emphasise the importance of inspection and approval to ensure that school standard be meet however it be equally important that the exist system be streamline to avoid unnecessary delay our child especially those with special educational need deserve learn environment that be safe supportive and conducive to their success urge the government to ensure that funding for project such as dorset studio school be release without delay even as the bill seek to improve the system itself these child deserve well the bill be landmark piece of legislation that promise to transform the life of child across england it be testament to the government unwavere commitment to the safeguarding and welfare of child welcome it as an opportunity to ensure that every child regardless of their background have access to the support protection and education they deserve follow my early police career and before enter this place work as an education welfare officer in large secondary school in the forest of dean see at first hand the impact of disrupt education the pandemic only exacerbate those challenge and more and more child be miss school for number of reason vulnerable student be hit hard far deepen exist inequality feel within the education system the disruption to their education be not just academic though it pose pastoral problem we have system where parent can choose to home educate without any check or scrutiny and that can lead to crisis of safeguarding as child be often unaccounted for during this time let be clear be not say that home education and every single school absence be safeguard concern but have deal with some horrific safeguarding case in my previous career be sure the house will agree that even one safeguarding case be one too many and that we should all be do something to ensure the safety of our child currently there be no legal requirement for parent to inform local authority if their child be be home school and that lack of oversight leave child at risk as their need and safety may be overlook the bill aim to address those oversight by introduce requirement for child educate outside of school to be register with local authority can the hon member give single case of home educate child be harm who be not already know to social service again and again it be failure of social service when notify not the absence of burdensome register for parent who often home educate their child out of desperation during my previous career in the police and in education there be case will not say individual name in the house but be more than happy to liaise with the right hon member and his colleague outside the chamber about case have deal with do the hon member agree that the case of sara sharif show that her father and stepmother use this home school loophole to withdraw she from school because sign be be notice and that this new legislation could have protect she and should protect other wholeheartedly agree and that be exactly what have deal with over many year before join this place the bill aim to address the oversight by introduce that requirement for child educate outside of school to be register with the local authority that simple step will ensure well tracking and safeguarding of child help we guarantee that all child especially those educate outside of traditional system be account for and support from now on no child will be forget invisible or leave behind it be also right that we acknowledge the invaluable role of kinship carer many child in kinship care face unique challenge include with their mental health and emotional support need however not all child in kinship care arrangement receive the same support as child in formal care in fact report find that of local authority either lack kinship care policy or have outdated one that be not good enough for kinship carer or child in kinship care the bill will ensure that kinship care be legally define and that local authority publish comprehensive and up to date local offer and provide carer with essential information about financial assistance and about health education and wellbeing service that will go some way towards level the playing field and will ensure consistency in the support available to kinship carer and child across the country the bill be more than just set of policy it be commitment to the protection education and wellbeing of our child by prioritise the mental emotional and educational need of child we be lay the foundation for future in which every child can succeed regardless of their circumstance urge all member to support the bill and to work together to ensure that every child have the opportunity they deserve to thrive have be secondary school teacher before become an mp congratulate the government on bring forward legislation that once again put child at the heart of what we in this place want to achieve the every child matters initiative be introduce nearly two decade ago my party and welcome many thing in this bill but we believe that it could go even far it be clear from discussion with the national association of head teachers in bath and north east somerset that local authority need further responsibility for admission be pleased that local authority will have great power to direct admission to maintain school and academy when child need place however if the local authority have responsibility for admission it should have the power of an admission authority welcome the introduction of register for child not in school we liberal democrats support the policy that all new teacher in state fund primary and secondary school should have or be work towards qualified teacher status that be crucial step in uphold the quality of education and we liberal democrats have be call for it for long time be little more sceptical on the core pay and condition framework teacher deserve system that value their dedication equally no matter where they work the bill promise something that we can all support single framework for teacher pay and condition one set of rule apply consistently across government maintain school and academy that sound fair and most academy already follow the framework however the department for education have state before require academy to comply with the framework we will ask the school teachers review body to consider additional flexibility within the statutory framework to make it most effective for all school if academy decide to opt out teacher work just few street apart could find themselves on vastly different pay scale with different benefit and working hour simply because their school make different choice there could be postcode lottery when it come to teacher pay the impact do not stop there national benefit such as the teacher pension scheme which rely on widespread participation to remain viable could be put at risk if too many academy decide that the framework be too costly and leave it the system could unravel jeopardise the financial security of teacher across the country we must build an education system in which every teacher be treat fairly and equally regardless of the type of school that they work in that be critical issue of fairness and urge the government to ensure that that happen let turn to the decline mental health of our child and young people there be no mention in the bill of have dedicated qualified mental health professional in every school policy that we liberal democrats have be champion for long time around of mental illness begin to manifest before the age of so support in primary and secondary school be key dedicated mental health professional in every school would ensure that all child and parent have someone they could turn to for help there be many aspect of the bill that we liberal democrats support however urge the government to ensure that there be single framework for teacher pay and condition across government maintain school and academy also hope that they will join the liberal democrats in advocate for mental health professional in every school and for the extension of free school meal for child which we have mention before be proud to speak on this bill child grow up in our country deserve the good possible start in life where person be bear should not determine their future but after year of conservative government not all child have the same opportunity to succeed during those year the very notion of early intervention diverse educational pathway and early year priority be erode know that because be work on the frontline see what happen and the damage that be do the number of child live in poverty in the uk have rise by over since in my constituency of sherwood forest one in five child live in poverty across the east midland the number be almost one in four that be simply outrageous child deserve well that be why be pleased to support the bill it put child and their wellbeing and safety back at the heart of the government decision making where they belong be proud that the bill seek to improve safeguarding and protection for child throughout the education system make no mistake this be the single big piece of child protection legislation in generation and to suggest otherwise show total lack of understanding and no real knowledge of how child protection service work today another element of the bill that be really proud to see be the roll out of free breakfast club in primary school child experience at school massively impact their future and when child go hungry at school they be more likely to fall behind their peer be school governor and mother and know from all my friend who be teacher that child turn up to school who have not be feed or with empty lunchboxe have friend who regularly pick up meal deal from the local tesco to feed child at their school that be what year of conservative government have do to the poor and most vulnerable child in our country there be so many benefit to provide free breakfast club in primary school include improved literacy numeracy and cognitive functioning it allow child to fully participate and learn during lesson it give all child well start to the day and well start in life despite the talk of education improve under the last government sadly we hear the same old story only of the most deprived child reach level in both reading and math compare with of the least deprived child and those who receive free school meal be less likely to attain level in those subject than those who do not some of student from non selective state school have at least five good gcse for student attend selective state school that figure rise drastically to it be time we close this gap for good for the most deprived child in our society will be relentless in that pursuit for the child live in my constituency of sherwood forest have consistently advocate for victim of the rape gang scandal in my part of west yorkshire have raise the subject more than time in this place since be elect want to focus on that issue in the short time have be allocate to speak today it be over two decade since the labour mp ann cryer my predecessor first bring the issue to the house unfortunately we seem to be repeat the mistake of the past today it be deeply concern to that right hon and hon member on the government benches plan to vote against the call in the amendment for national rape gang inquiry last night the safeguarding minister the under secretary of state for the home department the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips tell the public that national inquiry be not need because local inquiry be more effective at bring about change however just minute after she make those remark local leader in bradford once again reject my long stand call for full local inquiry into rape gang across keighley and the wide bradford district argue that it would be too expensive that same local authority have spend more than million of public money on an empty music venue in the heart of bradford this be complete and utter dereliction of duty by local leader more importantly it demonstrate what have be try to say on this issue for year every time have bring up this issue at national level it be refer back down to local government but every time have take the prospect of an inquiry down to the local level the suggestion be block by local leader and be tell that this be national problem there have be complete vacuum of accountability in the system over the past two decade how many of the people involve have be hold accountable lose their job or have action take against they nobody have and that be exactly why have be advocate for local inquiry across the bradford district for far too long report of page that look at five child who have be sexually exploit in the bradford district be release in it acknowledge that there have be mistake but nobody be hold to account the amendment rightly table by the leader of the opposition be important because it tackle systematic problem and will end this vacuum of accountability once and for all conviction should follow national inquiry that focus on rape gang and child sexual exploitation when local leader refuse their duty and ignore the concern of local victim it be only right that the government step in ultimately this be not about party politic but about the difference between right and wrong for too long at all level of the british state in national and local government all those with safeguard responsibility have fail to do the right thing there be child and family out there know they have meet they in my constituency who have suffer abuse that be unspeakable they want the world to know the depth to which this scandal reach they fear as do that the scale of gang rape and child sexual exploitation across the bradford district will dwarf that in rotherham they want an end to this accountability vacuum on behalf of my constituent across keighley and indeed the wide bradford district urge everyone in the house to vote with their conscience stand up for what be right do the right thing and vote for national rape gang inquiry welcome the bill and will talk about the difference that it will make to child live in poverty in my constituency of stockton north first however remind the house of the word of dame rachel de souza the children commissioner for england who say that too many of our service be fail we hear powerful testimony from the hon member for dorking and horley chris coghlan who describe the tragic consequence of those failing we also hear the expert word of my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister whose recommendation on multi agency team and the unique identifier will make difference in ensure that no child fall through the crack and that this legislation keep child safe the bill will also drive forward equality of opportunity we hear from my hon friend the member for bury north mr frith the prediction that breakfast club measure will save family but for many family in stockton north rather than save the measure will simply ensure that child go to school with breakfast we have hear from many member include my hon friend the members for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson and for stroud dr opher and the hon member for twickenham munira wilson about the benefit of automatic enrolment for free school meal as someone who grow up eligible for free school meal but never access they can say that that would definitely make difference to child in my constituency and encourage the government to look at that commend stockton on tees borough council for conduct trial in that area the scale of the challenge of child poverty in my constituency be enormous figure from the north east child poverty commission indicate that child poverty have increase by over the last decade and that one in three child in my area now live in poverty it be heartbreaking to see sign in local community centre ask for donation of basic essential such as soap or toothpaste for child who attend event there or security tag on infant milk formula which be one of the item most steal from local supermarket when parent steal infant milk formula it be because they have hungry baby at home admire the optimism of the father of the house who speak early about the possibility of future conservative government but baby child and young people in my constituency do not have time to wait for that encourage member to support the bill which will benefit child and family such as those in stockton north where recently meet young man young father who be strive for the dignity of stable employment and the opportunity to earn decent wage to support their family they will have hear today that this government be on the side of working class family and have make clear my commitment to every child and young person in stockton north together we can break the link between background and opportunity create well future for all child in stockton billingham and norton very little of the bill apply to northern ireland other than clause so perhaps when she sum up the debate the minister will explain what legislation will be subject to regulation in this house if she so decide have say that wish to comment on the bill because have the privilege of represent part of the united kingdom that consistently register high educational standard want the same for the rest of the country to which belong understand of course that there will always be people who fall through the bar and do not do as well in the education system but it be important that structure be in place that ensure the good for everyone one concern about the bill be that structure that have be in place for two decade and use under successive government of different hue will now be dismantle because of some ideological reason that the government have imagine will not have time in this short speech to go into those issue but hope that they will be tease out and properly consider during scrutiny of the bill secondly there have be limited consultation on home schooling and there be real fear from people who educate their child at home about the impact the bill might have much have be make of the fact that if the bill do not pass child will not be safeguard but the fact of the matter be that there have always be legislation to safeguard child as the hon member for dorking and horley chris coghlan point out even with legislation in place there be still failure by the police local authority social service and local council to carry out the safeguarding that be available to they in law my final point be that we can not have bill on child wellbee and at the same time ignore the controversy out there among the public as result of our renew exposure to the terrible event where pakistani rape gang have torture intimidate and abuse young girl yet we have turn blind eye to it do the right hon member agree that national inquiry into child sexual exploitation focus on groom gang be not only essential for justice for the innocent victim affect but would play crucial role in societal healing in the uk and that fail to initiate such an inquiry will leave stain on the government hinder transparency and obstruct the full truth the hon member be absolutely right of course we will be and have be accuse of have our own political agenda want to stir up racism march to musk drum and everything else but the demand at the end of the amendment be one that every decent person should wish to support because it would restore the trust that people have lose in see how this issue have be handle spend seven year manage team of barrister on public inquiry and have some insight into the benefit and limitation of public inquiry do the right hon member really think that wreck the bill would lead to single perpetrator be bring to justice or protect single child from these despicable crime first support the amendment do not wreck the bill interruption secondly there be misconception that if we do not support the bill no action will be take there be plenty of legislation under which to take the action at present it be simply case of do it and give people the assurance that it be be do also the public inquiry would ensure that those who think they can hide deny and cover up would finally be expose because the house be willing to take they on and expose what have happen that be why it be so important we can not allow the situation to prevail we know that this issue be far more widespread than be ever think there have be denial indeed remember the previous member for telford raise this issue time and again in the last parliament and be shout down at that stage although she be provide the evidence this be what we need to expose the leader of the telford council be say there be no need to tell the home office and no need for an inquiry now of course we know what happen in telford restore trust in politician and the system be what public inquiry would do it would not have to lead to no action be take in the meantime listen to the hon member for rotherham sarah champion have great admiration for she because she be prepared to stand up even when it mean abuse from some of her own party member who argue that to have an inquiry would delay justice be do as have say do not believe that that be the case an inquiry would not mean that we would stop take action of course we could still take action but it would lead to the full fact be know those involve be expose and action take against they to ensure that it do not happen again tell the house that the long people think that these thing can be cover up and hide and attention divert the less they will be prepared to do the job that they be mean to do and we will have vulnerable people be exploit continually without the protection that they deserve the very real and transformational merit of the bill be clear measure on brand uniform and free breakfast club will help family in southampton itchen and put money back in their pocket register child who be not in school and have unique number for every child will help multiple agency to safeguard our child and work well together more importantly have already deal with the tory legacy of endless teacher strike labour bill will start value qualified teacher once again who inspire our next generation and will be pay they consistently the bill will also ensure that all child regardless of school model or structure can be inspire by refreshed curriculum that set they up for life any member who have work in education or social care will not recognise the fanciful picture of the tories record if it be so rosy they may want to reflect on why they be now on the opposition benches let we have bit of honesty what they leave be inadequate funding and crumble building they be against fully qualified teacher there be endless strike over pay and recruitment and retention be complete disaster those be the inconvenient fact that some of they want to avoid all because of an obsession with buzzword and structure not with child outcome they talk about educational vandalism but they be guilty of it want to focus my remain comment on measure that will make difference to group whose voice be often not hear enough in this debate child and young people who have experience be in care we have have the excellent independent review of child social care carry out by my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister which we should remember be commission by the last conservative government and then inexplicably and unforgivably put on the shelf and ignore in that report my hon friend warn that without significant change of course the number of child in care would exceed in this country this bill can and must be that change of course ensure that local authority offer family group conferencing be hugely welcome and will give opportunity for the child voice to be hear when plan potentially life change intervention to ensure that those be the good possible change for some live with member of extended family will turn their life around so welcome the legal recognition of kinship care that will ensure solid support and home close to their support network for the child and young people in that situation ask that the minister perhaps reflect on the extent to which child and young people voice will be hear in design those measure support for care leaver be crucial so welcome the extension of the stay close support it represent transition to independence and step to get decent housing and vital service for those young people but it be not just theory or programme it be already work when be cabinet member for child service in southampton we introduce it three year ago it have be an enormous success in term of the quality of support and the outcome for young people in rare moment of cross party agreement reflect on the comment of the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith agree that the support lodging scheme from the home for good and safe families charity be worth look at the result be impressive in term of safety good relationship confidence and be more likely to be in education employment and training the goal of this important bill be to ensure opportunity for every child and young person not just those in the tories preferred model of school but of schoolchildren safe start for every one of they the government who take this seriously be those who act on it that be this labour government not posture like the opposition or ideologically wreck it but take action so that child can thrive in life rise order before call the next member be impose three minute time limit let start by say how much welcome the bill as an important step in strengthen the role of education and multi agency safeguarding arrangement so that we can well identify and protect vulnerable child headteacher in my constituency reach out to and say child do disclose to teacher particularly in primary school we spend so many hour with child we be often the voice for the child parent can often tell authority thing that be not true the tragic death of sara sharif in my county of surrey serve as sobering reminder of the current weakness in the system and the consequence of not get such an important piece of legislation right for child at risk of neglect and abuse as school governor for eight year with responsibility for safeguarding understand little of the load that teacher carry that keep they awake at night one headteacher tell unless you have spend sleepless night worry about child knock on door in the hope that child be still alive you do understand as governor during covid when all our vulnerable child be stick at home initially understand that the bill be welcome first step but there be much more the government can do to support child and young people welcome the creation of register of child not in school but believe the bill should go far as it stand parent will no long have an automatic right to home educate if their child be subject to child protection investigation or under child protection plan however be not clear whether these provision would have protect child such as sara who be previously know to social service but be not at the time of her death would be grateful if the minister could clarify whether in order to protect such child the bill will ensure that parent will not have an automatic right to home educate if their child have also have history of child protection investigation or child protection plan rather than if the investigation or plan be live at the time be also pleased with the provision compelling local authority to share information it take one school locally four year to track down family who have withdraw their child and that family then go missing support call for the bill to make provision for dedicated qualified mental health professional in every school ensure that all child and parent have someone they can turn to for help in surrey there be almost child on mental health waiting list wait for an average of eight month provide dedicated mental health practitioner in these school would be highly effective in reach large number of child and young people finally be disappointed that the bill fall short on tackle the problem of send education in england as these child be at particular risk of be force out of the school system and into potentially much more vulnerable situation there be child in surrey miss school because of lack of provision order call sally jameson all child deserve the very good start in life and will vote in favour of this bill today on behalf of all the child in doncaster central who deserve just that along with many other measure be pleased that the bill acknowledge the immense challenge face by care leaver and care experienced child and that it will set high bar for council to support young people who have leave care in doncaster there be look after child in the bill success will be measure by their outcome which have long be ignore as former prison officer have work with many care leaver in the prison system and hear their experience some of which be harrowing the statistic speak for themselves it be estimate that around of young offender in custody and around of the entire prison population be care experienced that fact be most sobering when highlight the significant failure in the current system and it serve as reminder to we all that change must come it signify consistent and endure failure to support young people in the care system and tell our young people that if they need to be care for by the state they be less likely to lead positive and stable adult life it be the taxpayer frankly who be pick up the bill accord to research from become the number of young care leaver age between and approach local authority as homeless have increase by over the past five year and they be nine time more likely to face homelessness than other young people wholeheartedly welcome the measure in the bill that strengthen arrangement to support and assist care leaver in their transition to adulthood and hope that legislate for local authority to publish full local care offer for care leaver will offer much need clarity and direction which can often be uncertain hope the government will consider the recommendation from barnardo which suggest that the bill should extend corporate parenting principle to great range of public body include the home office the police and healthcare provider finally want to refer to something that have be raise by number of colleague today the disgusting and excessive profiteering that exist in child social care people and private provider who have no business in this area have be charge extortionate rate to council and taxpayer while deliver the appalling outcome that discuss early change be much need and be pleased that the bill be finally here it have be long time come for many vulnerable child across the country and look forward to see it progress as have be highlight on the opposition benches english education have be success story we have trust school to get on with the job and academy and new free school enjoy the freedom to run themselves pay their teacher more and improve their curriculum end central government and local government micromanagement have put power into the hand of people who know good school leader and teacher and it have work english school have soar up the global ranking under the conservatives the hon gentleman talk about put power into teacher hand be he aware of the number of teacher who have be so radicalise by the conservatives reform that they now surround on the labour benches well the figure speak for themselves as be highlight by my hon friend the member for west suffolk nick timothy who have morph into whip at the moment english school have soar up the ranking if we look at the recent pisa league table we see that english education be now rank seventh good for math and ninth for reading and science that be up from and respectively in meanwhile education in scotland and wales under the snp and labour where school be not grant those freedom have stagnate and slump in various global ranking so much so that some of they have withdraw altogether from some of those ranking want to focus on one problematic element of the bill which be raise by the hon member for bath wera hobhouse the government proposal would strip academy of the power to pay teacher more award performance and attract and retain talented people understand that at least two school in my constituency pay teacher more than the national pay scale oakland primary in biggin hill and pickhurst primary in hayes nearby the harris primary academy in shortlands and many more school in bromley also choose to pay teacher more the bill will strip academy of that power cut teacher pay and weakening school in any other industry pay reflect performance when vacancy can not be fill pay rise to attract talent that be why school should be able to vary from national pay scale school leader should be able to pay good teacher more and respond to the local job market instead the government want to wind the clock back and empower whitehall not school the government be so eager to be doom monger to justify their ideological policy that they risk wreck decade of progress who will benefit it be not the teacher or the child so why be they do it be not even sure that those on the government front bench know but what we do know be that the bill will destabilise year of progress and damage the future opportunity of young people across bromley and biggin hill and right across the nation in week where much have be say about protect child it be great to see the government act on the safety and wellbeing of child for child to be safe they need to be visible situation where child can fall off the radar of the authority task with protect they be clearly unacceptable but we know it happen we know that in minority of case child can be take out of school and out of the protection that school provide and come to harm that be why introduce register of child not in school be such an important and common sense measure it be right that parent will no long have an automatic right to home educate if their child be subject to child protection investigation it be right that local authority can identify child not in school in order to ensure that they be safe and it be right to introduce unique identity number for child that facilitate information sharing by the service charge with protect they as the children commissioner say write these landmark measure into law will be of huge significance for any child currently at risk of harm in this country be proud that the government be so swiftly take forward such measure my final point on home education be that it be important to recognise that the steep increase in home schooling be in part the result of parent of child with special educational need feel that those need be not be meet in mainstream education it be therefore vital that the bill run parallel to the important work that the government have already start at the budget to reform and invest in send system that have be severely neglect for too many year many other member have talk of the huge importance of every child have legal right of access to breakfast club and of the action we be take to ensure that school uniform be affordable nothing damage child wellbee more than child poverty of course there be much more to do but alongside the government child poverty strategy these be concrete step that will make real difference to family in my constituency and across the country take action to make difference change thing instead of call for yet another review serious work instead of parrot nonsense on social medium and pass legislation instead of scoring point this be serious work from government who understand the importance of ensure that all our child have the good possible start in life it be pleasure to stand here today and talk about bill that deliver on the government mission to break down barrier to opportunity there be two aspect that particularly welcome the first be the potential profit cap which will enable the secretary of state to cap the profit of non local authority ofsted register provider of child home foster agency and support accommodation there be area throughout the country include mine where the cost of place child in private sector residential social care be eye wateringly high regularly meet officer from my local authority nottinghamshire county council and the cost that they be incur to meet the need of child welfare have be describe by the council former conservative leader ben bradley as rinse local authority finance think it important for we to ensure that private company be not make excessive profit at the expense of other public sector service and therefore welcome the numerous measure in the bill that aim to rebalance the child social care placement market and drive down those excessive profit make by some unscrupulous private provider together with the demand for full financial transparency from those organisation and the potential for the creation of regional care co operative previously oversee child social care in local government do my hon friend agree that the introduction of those co operative will make huge difference not only to local government finance but to our ability to ensure that child grow up safe and happy indeed see the positive benefit of both those development we will be able to rebalance spending across local authority budget and provide significantly well and measurable standard of care at the same time the second aspect of the bill that particularly welcome be the introduction of free breakfast club in every primary school which will have significant and positive impact on family in mansfield in particular by help with the cost of live and support parent who be have to juggle work commitment however be especially motivated to support the bill because of some of the harrowing story that have hear from constituent numerous teacher in mansfield some of they visibly distressed and upset have tell that they have use their own money to buy food for child who have turn up to school with empty stomach young child who be so hungry that they can not concentrate on their study it be not that those child be unloved or wilfully neglect many come from love family with both parent work all hour to provide for they which leave precious little time for the preparation of meal before school this bill clearly drive home labour mission to break down barrier to opportunity and will be vote for it proudly on behalf of all the child and family in my area who will benefit from it this bill be landmark piece of legislation that not only demonstrate ambition but take tangible action to keep child safe improve educational standard and make family well off like many of we here get into politic to improve the life chance of child in my community and to make it reality that regardless of someone background or circumstance the only ceiling on their potential be their talent and your determination so be delighted to see the government bring forward this bill which begin the work of break down barrier to opportunity for our child as anyone who have be involve in our school or who have read any of the academic evidence on the subject will know that start with full stomach at the beginning of the day which breakfast club deliver they help with attention span and cognitive performance and they give parent great flexibility to earn during their work hour strengthen the law to set out specific number of brand school uniform item be an important step in the right direction and hope we will go far in due course my hon friend mention free breakfast club and the removal of some brand school uniform item we talk about uniform cost up to but do he agree that the figure be big than that for parent who have multiple child at the same school absolutely agree primary school child who typically wear polo shirt need five day worth plus pe kit this measure will make an enormous difference although it have be great to see organisation such as the winsford uniform exchange in my constituency grow and provide people with low cost and greener alternative bring cost down for family be absolutely the right priority the measure on breakfast club and school uniform may be the two most visible in the bill and hope that they will be part of the government last legacy of support all child to achieve and thrive the bill cover vast array of measure across the spectrum of child social care and school policy as we have discuss this afternoon will focus my comment predominantly on the school side although want to take moment to say something about the single unique identifier for child in lord laming report on the death of victoria climbié in he recommend that the government explore the safeguard benefit of national child database effectively single unique identifier to address poor communication and datum sharing between agency in report after case after report after case the issue of weak multidisciplinary working continue to arise the measure propose in this bill alongside the clarification of the legal basis for information sharing and the creation of multi agency child protection team will undoubtedly help but they be the start of the story not the end the success of this measure will be in ensure that the single unique identifier be consistently capture in reform working practice so that information sharing be part of the culture and in make it clear that local authority boundary health authority boundary police authority boundary and in my part of the world national boundary be not barrier to good safeguarding practice which have become more important as child travel far to appropriate education or care setting want to cover the reform that the bill make to academy in the minute or so that have leave be not ideological about the academy system have see multi academy trust that provide an outstanding level of support for their school equally have see mat that have not work and that have provide local leader with few lever to push for improvement on behalf of their community the reality be that the previous government leave we with school system that have become increasingly fragmented and lack coherence at local regional and national level the governance model be rarely the key determinant of whether school will provide good outcome for child as someone once say this be about standard not structure on that basis many of the reform propose in the bill be entirely sensible such as the requirement to teach the national curriculum the requirement to employ qualified teacher and give the school adjudicator the final say on admission number all of these measure will get we close to some consistency and common standard across the sector will leave it there just want to say that this legislation order there be time limit be both former teacher and former council leader and speak on behalf of many of my former colleague when say that this bill be welcome and will make difference to child across st helens north it will also make positive difference to the ability of those who work in education and other service to protect and support child and young people that be why will vote for the bill and can not support the opposition wreck amendment break down barrier to opportunity be key government mission and one that in my experience have be vital to all those who choose to work with child and young people when be council leader in st helens we make give every child the good possible start in life the council no priority and learn that partnership work be key together we be able to take child service from inadequate when become leader to good and outstanding warmly welcome the bill measure to encourage datum sharing and multi agency work in all council across the country member on both side of the house should welcome the bill measure to improve child protection and safeguarding to improve support for child in care and care leaver and to introduce well regulation of the child home sector on wide issue under the bill scope warmly welcome the concrete measure to put money back in family pocket at time when we know thing be difficult for many practical measure such as limit the number of brand item of school uniform and introduce free breakfast club in primary school could save family in st helens north year perhaps more importantly these measure will make sure that child can start each day with full stomach healthy happy and ready to learn also want to see high standard and more opportunity for every child in every school say this not just from my professional background and interest but more importantly as parent be pleased to see this run right through the bill and through everything the secretary of state and education ministers have say since take office this mean put qualified expert teacher at the front of every classroom include in academy and develop new national curriculum to ensure that young people be ready for work and ready for life however as mention early have no doubt that the most important aspect of this bill will ensure that child and young people be safe at home and at school this bill be the big upgrade in child protection in generation and it should be something we can all support finish by pay tribute to my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion who speak so passionately and clearly about child protection as well as the importance of vote for the bill today and implement the jay inquiry recommendation as soon as possible this should be something on which we can all agree welcome this wide range bill that focus on the important issue of keep child safe provide more support for child in care address child poverty raise educational standard and return local authority to the centre of school place planning give the cost of living and with child poverty as high as in my constituency welcome the clause on limit school uniform cost parent be too often force to prioritise their school choice base on the cost of the school uniform which be form of selection if the hounslow school my son attend could limit brand kit to an iron on blazer badge tie and pe shirt so that the rest could be buy at supermarket why can not all school do this also welcome the introduction of breakfast club in all school as former local councillor and lead member for child be pleased that the government be give power back to local authority on place planning and proposal for new school right remove by the conservative government after the opening closing growth contraction and entry criterion of any school have direct effect on neighbouring school and local transport service furthermore the cynical practice of off roll by school that be try to up their exam score be another example of why the local authority role be so important welcome the relevant clause in this bill finally every school in hounslow be rat good or outstanding be sorry to disagree slightly with my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh who be no long in the chamber but in my experience the single big factor in successfully turn around fail school be not its governance structure but the inspirational leadership of great headteacher to address the recruitment and retention challenge in school leadership future great school leader need to be identify and support before they burn out and leave the profession mid career as fear many be do my question to ministers be whether the workforce and finance challenge inherit from the previous government will be address to deliver the full potential of this excellent bill child grow up in our country and in my city of portsmouth deserve the very good start in life and nothing less as teacher for year have see the good in education and unfortunately under the conservatives the very bad the good journey in life be not easy and it be shameful that under the last government we see the scrapping of sure start and building schools for the future the narrowing of the curriculum failure to meet target in recruitment and retention lack of join up service in education and health lack of child protection the ignoring of inquiry recommendation and an ofsted system that be not fit for purpose in short there be disregard for our child future in just six month this government have introduce bill that seek to reverse that situation the bill be innovative and importantly in draft the measure the government have listen to the voice of charity professional parent child and young people the bill provide an opportunity to truly transform life the measure will take action in the wake of appalling and tragic child abuse case create register of child not in school save family in portsmouth potentially year per child through the creation of breakfast club cap brand uniform introduce national pay and condition for teacher and ensure that kinship carer have clear guidance could continue with this list because the bill set out so many more action to benefit the wellbeing of child but want to concentrate on home schooling the relationship between many family and local authority on home schooling be adversarial and characterise by mistrust that relationship must be reset the register be vital to stop child slip through the crack it be crucial that home schooling be clear choice and when choose be not battle between parent and local authority parent must not feel they have no choice but to home school because the previous government dismantle send provision in our school or because child have be offload by some school we must ensure that every family who make the decision to home school be do so freely and with the good interest of their child at the forefront believe the child register will help provide datum and understanding the new duty for mainstream and alternative provision school to co operate with local authority on place planning will help ensure plan for adequate school place which know will be welcome in my constituency the bill be the single big piece of child protection legislation and it be what the child in my city and our country deserve welcome the announcement by the chancellor that the money raise from vat on private school will fund breakfast club for pupil in my constituency give they the good start to the day want to highlight mattersey primary school in my constituency rural school that be one of the small in the country with only pupil of whom shockingly receive pupil premium funding the school currently run breakfast club for day and have apply to be an early adopter of the free breakfast club scheme as the policy be roll out across the country urge the secretary of state to learn from the school how it run its breakfast club and invite she to visit the school for some child home schooling have be valuable and enable they to be educate in surrounding where they feel safe and can achieve their very good however there be huge danger and in some case home schooling have become vehicle that have put vulnerable child at great risk be concern by see too many child out in the street during school hour with parent catch up in generational cycle of benefit dependency and their child miss out on school because they be supposedly be home school at an early age those child be already face future of live on benefit and in black economy culture that concern be amplify where child be be hide whether they be like sara sharif or part of extreme religious group control child life and welfare in which the victim of abuse be silence all of we can and should support the government recommendation for oversight and registration in this sector the previous mp for bassetlaw lord mann give evidence on behalf of more than people to professor jay inquiry he and my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion be the only mp who do that in bassetlaw sit and listen to victim of child abuse this be crisis in all community the idea that the government should give action against one kind of child abuse priority be obscene and dangerous anyone who do not understand that should read the report by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse there be lot of unfinished business this be not just about legislation my office have be work since the moment be elect to get my constituent terry lodge who be enslave as child in foundry the compensation that nottinghamshire county council have accept that it will pay for his loss of childhood but which be still to be pay out that be in our country in white rural england child abuse be in every corner of our country be not prepared to wait three or four more year for action and neither should the victim or the survivor be require to wait any long want to read out message from survivor that have receive while sit in the chamber guess victim of abuse want to be believe to see justice serve and to hold the people who know and do help accountable not listen to another multi million pound inquiry last year which point out the obvious will end by say that instead of make this issue into political football will listen to my constituent order call dave robertson be still quite new member but over the last month we have be privileged to see the good of the house its support for the fight in ukraine and the terminally ill adult end of life bill spring to mind even in this afternoon debate the speech from the hon member for dorking and horley chris coghlan and the right hon member for skipton and ripon sir julian smith be excellent contribution that show the house in an exceptional light unfortunately this evening may yet see the disappointing spectacle of member choose to vote against measure to protect child solely so that they can make political statement that be significant concern reconfirm to any member on the opposition benches who be think of support the amendment that if they do they be vote to block the bill they be decline to give it second reading in block the bill they be block the single child identifier and the register of child not in school which be step that the government be take to protect vulnerable child we have hear from some member that they want to call for an inquiry in certain place they can still do that if the bill pass second reading as hope it will there be nothing in the bill to stop such inquiry or to prevent people from continue to campaign for they by vote against the bill to support the amendment be to vote against the bill they be vote against measure to protect child to make political point that be not act in the great tradition of this place could talk for over an hour on this matter but have minute left so will touch on school uniform around three year ago alongside business school and the community set up lichfield back to school bank uniform recycling scheme last year we support more than family and around of the city school pupil pick up uniform from we we prevent six tonne of carbon emission through that alone that however be not the real reason why be so proud of that many parent speak to talk about the weight lift off their shoulder when they be able to access school uniform because the cost be so high and such concern parent come over at the end of the event with couple of bag of thing to put on their kid which help they out with cost they be reduce to tear they have be feel pressure they have be look ahead to the cost and do not know how they would meet it be able to get that stuff at no cost release that pressure valve hope that story stay with for very long time those be the story we need to focus on story of the real world impact in our constituency want to make the house aware that my partner work for teacher training provider the bill represent real step towards close the gap through which child be fall parent and carer in birmingham northfield will welcome the measure in the bill to help keep the cost of school uniform down to extend free breakfast club to every primary school and to tackle the profiteering by the pirate of the high need which my hon friend the member for mansfield steve yemm speak about so convincingly agree with member from across the house who have say that beyond the bill we need to see progress in this parliament on our child happiness and on send we can not lose sight of the fact that the new duty to report safeguard concern will protect child and save life may say how welcome it be to see in the bill the name of the safeguarding minister the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips child abuse be the cruell and most cowardly of crime and few have do as much as she to champion victim the public hounding that we have see in the past week which some member of this house have fail to condemn represent threat to public safety disgrace to public life and an insult to survivor of grooming and abuse some of my constituent will take an interest in the vote on the conservative amendment as well as on the bill want to be clear the amendment be lengthy hodgepodge of objection to the bill and fundamentally disagree with it it would have the effect of delay action on safeguarding conclude by say to opposition front benchers that if they continue with the opportunistic weaponising of the most sensitive and serious issue which we have learn over the last day have extend to use this matter as fundraising opportunity they will remain in opposition and will deserve to do so it be privilege to be call to speak in this debate will focus my remark on the impact of this bill on school and parent in my constituency however first pay tribute to the family of holly newton from my constituency and to northumberland domestic abuse services which campaign tirelessly to provide protection for victim and young people in my constituency this landmark legislation be return to grown up sensible solution base politic and policymaking which for year this country have be deny unfortunately all too often parent in my constituency find the cost of uniform prohibitive that additional cost place burden on family who should be focus on send their child to what will be and in many case be genuinely world class school in my constituency be privileged to visit acomb first school longhorsley church of england first school and hexham middle school before christmas will be off on another school visit on friday the bill be merely the start for this child focus and child centric government be incredibly grateful to the secretary of state for join on pre election visit to the middle school in corbridge where we meet child and student and where soon will be pound the pavement and knock on door for our excellent council candidate be probably the first member to mention the local election in so guess it be now open season small school across my constituency have really suffer from county council that be not focus enough on the need of parent and child there be lack of school transport provision which have speak about in this place and lack of send provision which hear about at almost every single surgery that hold genuine concern have also be raise about bellingham middle school parent and resident feel that the conservative run administration at northumberland county hall have simply abandon the school and be content to let it wither be sure that there be some good intentione conservative councillor at county hall who would object to that but that be the view of the community in the second that have leave would like to pay tribute to those on the government front bench for their relentless focus on address the practical need of my constituent thank the secretary of state and the ministerial team for the time that they have give to and to other member from the north east for their focus on improve the outcome for school and for the time that they have spend speak about the challenge of small school in my northumberland constituency have finish my speech with five second to spare childhood be precious thing it can shape we or break we too many childhood have be steal by poverty abuser and the inaction of the previous government in britain today million child be grow up in absolute poverty more be be place in unregistered child home and it be estimate by the education policy institute that child be miss from the education system although opposition members seem to have wake up to the evil of child abuse and exploitation they can not deny that their lack of care and urgency on these issue have make our child more vulnerable their failure to act have create an environment in which it be estimate that almost half million child experience some sort of sexual abuse in this country every year and their failure to implement single recommendation from the jay report have make it easy for groomer in every corner of our country to continue to rob our child of their childhood their future and their dignity that be the cost of the previous government do nothing approach to child abuse and they should be ashamed the previous government failure have also see council struggle to cover the spiral cost of placement in croydon where be privileged to be an mp the council have have to cough up almost million to cover the cost of child service with of child there grow up in the shadow of poverty croydon young people have be fail by the inaction of the previous government it be time to end the previous government addiction to fail our child and support the bill the bill cut the cost of send child to school by introduce free breakfast club and tackle the cost of school uniform it also prevent vulnerable child from fall through the crack by bring in register of child who be educate from home and introduce unique identifier so that child be visible across the system the bill be the single big piece of child protection legislation in generation vote against it be vote against child safety their childhood and their future it be shameful that even in opposition conservative members continue to drag their foot on child protection continue to fail our child and continue to put the interest of their party before the good interest of our country unlike the opposition we will not turn our back on our child we will not accept failure and we will finally put the wellbeing of our child first child grow up in bournemouth deserve the good start in life nothing less whoever you be and wherever you come from you should be able to go as far as your talent take you and those talent should be rigorously systematically and compassionately nourish for everyone would not be here but for the teacher of my childhood thank alan garner and christine moore it feel really weird to name they in full thank mr garner and mrs moore who do so much to enable to get here they stay late in the classroom so that could have safe warm place to do my homework they inspire to do well when circumstance tell that could not so thank you to they the reality be that for many child opportunity be too often limited and their background can have decisive impact on the life that they can build welcome the bill because it will help every child to achieve and thrive at school with excellent teaching and high standard it will focus on disadvantaged child and those with special educational need and disability in bournemouth we have particularly significant send crisis the bill will get child ready for the school day by provide free breakfast club in primary school want to give shout out to pokesdown community primary school chef russ and ali bayliss be two fantastic leader provide nutritious breakfast for young child the bill will ease the financial burden on parent by limit the number of brand uniform item be particularly pleased about that because only this week be contact by constituent richard merghani base in southbourne who raise concern about the cost of school uniform welcome the government proposal estimate show that it could save parent over per child on the back to school shop want to bring the voice of constituent and local educational expert into this debate be think of david nayler who be the headteacher at stourfield junior school for year lyn gaudreau who have be senior principal adviser to dorset local authority education authority simon adorian former headteacher patrick connolly former educational professional and caroline ellis nursery manager they have inform everything that would have say if have long than four minute and everything that will contribute as the bill develop and pass through the commons thank they for their expertise and for what they contribute we should really be listen to they not conservative members who have disgrace themselves in this debate and in recent day thank the government front benchers for bring forward the bill and prioritise child so early in the life of this labour government it feel like unfinished business the last labour government do so much to improve the lot of child and young people we be just pick up where they leave off look forward to see the bill progress and to the future of all our child be so much bright there be few reason why put my head above the parapet and enter frontline politic and step from the classroom bench as former deputy headteacher to the green benches of this house to represent family in wolverhampton north east but none be close to my heart than this under the previous conservative government we lose sight of what be most important that child be happy healthy and safe have see the good of what education can offer have work with brilliant teacher and hard work dedicated support staff have work in school where of student be disadvantaged school that exceed expectation despite the odd but have also see the deep and grow divide in our education system divide that do not stop at the school gate but spill out into wide society and the bill will take important step to address they educational inequality be the define challenge of our time disadvantaged student have always face hurdle but in recent year those hurdle have become insurmountable for many inflame by the pandemic and the cost of living crisis school in wolverhampton and willenhall and across the country be battle worrying rise in school absence one in five child be now regularly absent and that figure be rise to one in four some child nationally be severely absent miss over half of their school session the scale of the crisis be staggering it be the equivalent of our wolves molineux stadium be fill five time over with child who have miss half the school year those child be not just miss lesson they be miss the foundation for well future the bill take the important step to reverse that tide by strengthen safeguarding for every child it protect the most vulnerable by ease the financial burden on family include cut cost of school uniform and by commit to free breakfast club in every primary school it tackle simple yet profound barrier to attendance by create truly child centre social care system and end extortionate profit making in child care it ensure that the need of the child come first have dedicate my life to education and wholeheartedly support the bill it be not just step in the right direction it be foundation for the future for the record my wife be employ as special educational need co ordinator in local authority school in the london borough of bexley welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the bill on aspect relate to look after child and academy on look after child the bill would make series of change on accommodation as colleague have comment which include increase ofsted oversight of organisation that operate multiple child home or independent foster agency introduce financial oversight regime for certain independent agency and child home provider and allow the secretary of state to cap the profit of child home provider and independent foster agency from my year as local councillor know how badly those change be need my local authority in bexley like many other have struggle to control those area with regulation and struggle with the financial aspect last year we see the large child service overspend of any london borough as result of those issue therefore welcome the measure to limit the profit of specified non local authority ofsted register social provider of child home and foster agency which have continually raise their cost far above inflation to profit from the taxpayer and from the care cost of our most vulnerable child welcome the change in clause to to school admission arrangement require school and local authority to co operate to manage admission and give local authority the power to direct academy school to admit pupil in my local authority we have school where over of the child do not live in our borough because of the admission arrangement that our academy school have decide to put in place in borough where of school have be academise we rely on their good will as to how many pupil they will admit each year from our local authority and how those applicant will be prioritise that have result in the same conservative councillor who cheer lead the roll out of academy openly complain to and colleague that they no long have control over admission criterion today we have the opportunity to give this landmark legislation its second reading it will improve education standard and strengthen protection for the most vulnerable child in bexleyheath and crayford and across our country it will drive high and rise standard in school through common sense reform and it will prevent child from fall through the crack by introduce landmark reform to safeguard child social care the bill be the single big piece of child protection legislation in generation vote for the amendment be vote against the bill and against the safety of our child their childhood and their future urge all member to vote with and the government and to give the bill its second reading wish to move away from the distracting insult and dangerous politic of some conservative members and return to the key principle of the bill which will reduce the pervasive inequality in our society it will drive high standard throughout our education and care system so that every child can achieve and thrive no matter where and into what circumstance they be bear in aylesbury of child live in absolute poverty that reality be sometimes lose in the perception of buckinghamshire as wealthy place which mask significant inequality will highlight three way in which the bill will make difference to child and family struggle in my constituency first support the bill commitment to deliver high and rise standard for every child in school by establish core national standard from which all school can build and innovate when visit school meet child full of hope and ambition and teacher determine to drive that ambition forward however budget be stretch staff recruitment be tough and standard across the sector be uneven the bill contain very welcome measure such as put more qualified teacher in classroom and update the pay and condition framework for teacher include in school in area with high level of deprivation have hear great idea in my constituency about the curriculum and assessment review include from some brilliant pupil speak to at the grange school look forward to see the outcome of that review later this year secondly be pleased that the bill will support the many parent and carer who be struggle with the cost of living free breakfast club will save parent and carer per child and limit the number of brand school uniform item will save per child in the back to school shop one broughton resident tell that seven brand item cost they seven item that their child will grow out of or lose before they know it they say that the cost be crippling family even more so in this current climate and it be only get bad we have hear those concern and be act on they through the bill thirdly be so pleased that the bill will ensure that few child fall through the crack in the education system welcome in particular the measure to introduce register of child out of school with unique number for every child recently speak to headteacher in aylesbury about the scandal she call ghost who disappear from school and social service in buckinghamshire alone the number of child miss education have double in the past two year the measure in the bill will ensure that the most vulnerable child can not be withdraw from school until it be confirm that it be in their good interest and there be suitable alternative education for they this be deeply principle bill that we can all take pride in it be realisation of one of our most important ambitious for this country that no matter who someone be or the circumstance they be bear into the government will support they to make success of their life welcome the measure that the secretary of state have set out to drive up standard and protect child it be just shame that so much cynical politic have be play in relation to the bill in recent day one of the good part of be new mp have be visit local school from yew tree primary to tividale hall and see smile face excited about the future however it be sad reality that child in my constituency and across the country have be let down not by their hard work teacher but by system in which public service have crumble rise special educational need and disability have go unmet and child have slip through the crack central mission of this labour government be to break down barrier to opportunity every child deserve the good start in life but we know that the play field be not level and we join the labour party to do something about it in sandwell of local child be eligible for free school meal compare with of child nationally education should be the springboard that break the link between the circumstance of person birth and what they can achieve but something be not work in sandwell we do not recognise the rosy picture paint by the conservative party that everything be great in school and all teacher love their job the year old who leave sixth form in july have spend their whole school career under conservative administration and in that time gcse and level attainment have completely stagnate in my area of sandwell anyone who look at graph of level and level attainment locally under the previous labour government would have see steady climb child do well and well in school but over the period of the last conservative government that progress have grind to complete halt we have be stick in situation where the proportion of child in sandwell attain two level or equivalent be percentage point below the national average that be not because child in sandwell be not as smart as child elsewhere it be because the system have not be work this bill will put more qualified teacher in front of class create cutting edge national curriculum and give all school the flexibility to recruit and retain the expert teacher our child need we want our child to go to school in the right headspace with hungry mind not hungry belly that be exactly what this bill will do with breakfast club that will improve concentration behaviour and attendance and help family finance also want to touch on something that be at the heart of this bill the fact that it be the single big piece of child protection legislation in generation while some be play politic we be take action introduce register of child not in school and unique number for every child and implement multi agency child protection team in the past six month the labour government have do more for child than the conservatives do in year this bill protect child their childhood and their future and break down barrier to opportunity that be why will be proud to vote for it today rise to speak to three point free breakfast club the clause deal with kinship care and have spend the past seven year manage team of barrister on public inquiry the opposition wreck amendment first we all know that child who have breakfast perform well at learn and bit like can be well behave as well however with the cost of living crisis leave to we by the last government far too many parent struggle to ensure that child get regular morning meal have be chair of governor at nursery school be keenly aware that the great impact we can make on person life chance come in the early year the derby poverty commission be explore with partner how free breakfast club can be provide in nursery school in derby and be look to work with business to fund that hope the government will keep under review whether in future the positive impact of free breakfast club can be extend to nursery school as well as primary school do my hon friend agree that it be also important to look at breakfast club for certain secondary school to make sure that teenager be also get the breakfast that they deserve and need for learn the evidence be clear on the real benefit that breakfast can give our child and young people secondly the bill require local authority to consider kinship care before they issue proceeding for child to go into the care system avoid take child into care when it be safe to do so lead to far well outcome in the first decade of my practice as barrister spend significant time in family care proceeding be frustrate by delay then and the situation now be far bad delay and limbo be hugely damaging to vulnerable child and their family finally be hugely disappoint by the opposition wreck amendment have spend the past seven year on public inquiry and have some insight into the benefit and limitation of those inquiry the opposition newly discover conviction that further inquiry on child sexual exploitation be need and their attempt to hijack this bill smack of political point scoring and headline grab and the suggestion we have hear that further inquiry could be do in year be wholly unrealistic inquiry can make recommendation but they can not implement they that be our job and wreck this bill will not achieve that my hon friend have highlight the landmark nature of this bill many of the most historically significant measure for improve child welfare and wellbeing have enjoy cross party support and be think here of the children act the order intervention really do have to be brief lot of member still wish to get in and we be on very tight time limit the hon lady have already earn an additional minute of injury time and regret that will not get all member in if we continue to have long intervention just wish to say that nearly decade after the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse be set up it be high time that the victim who so bravely give evidence see action welcome this bill because at its heart it put child first it do so in number of way and want to start by talk about child who be out of school parent have the right to decide whether their child be in school and support that principle absolutely but the state have duty to ensure that every child have high quality education it be fundamental right not privilege and one that we must protect this bill address fundamental shift that have take place over the last few year in hartlepool the number of child be home school have increase by since the pandemic in the last year alone the number of parent refuse to engage with the local authority in anything other than writing have nearly double add to that the number of child miss from education which be completely separate measure be now in hartlepool we have duty to protect those child and their education the vast majority of parent do phenomenal job in those circumstance but we have to accept the truth that there be time when they do not and this bill protect those child second issue that think be really important be exclusion in hartlepool we now have about permanent exclusion the capacity of the local authority to support such child be and it be expect to double over the next year without action this be that action and give local authority increase power to ensure that exclusion do not happen when they be not necessary will help local authority such as hartlepool want to finish by reflect on the support that the bill give to family we have hear about free breakfast in every primary school join the labour party because as young teaching assistant see child come to school hungry every day to be able to stand here today know that be about to vote to make sure that no primary school child ever face that again be proud moment for indeed on school uniform want to point to the level of need that exist in hartlepool natalie frankland an amazing individual who run the charity hartlepool reloved clothing have distribute piece of free school uniform in just two and half year that be the level of need that exist and this bill help those family it put money back into their year minimum and more if they have more than one child and it protect child and support family it be what the tories be try to wreck tonight and it be what we be go to support when think about why be go to support this bill and why it be so important to think about the number of child have teach over the year the sad reality be that of all the young people we teach the vast majority we do not get the opportunity to see again we do not see they grow up or what they do be proud to say that have bump into few of my former student over the year because some of they have go into the teaching profession one of they be actually in the death in paradise christmas special the year before last and one of they be the star striker for harlow town football club there be the other side of that however and once have the horrible experience of look at the front page of the local newspaper and see two of my former student who have tragically die in car accident but perhaps should not have mention that realise why be so passionate about teach and support young people and that be because feel so passionate as many of my colleague do about ensure that young people have the good possible opportunity to fulfil their potential truly believe that every young person have the potential to achieve if we give they the opportunity also believe that it be less about the type of school that young people go to and more about the broad range of subject that they can study so that every young person have the opportunity to star as say early have some genuine concern do not want to get into the politic of this but be concern about the number of young people who have fall through the gap certainly recently and welcome measure in the bill to introduce register of student who be not in school also welcome news about single unique identifier wear my hat as chair of the all party group for young carer and young adult carer mention the importance of ensure that young carer form part of that unique identifier and part of teacher training just little ask also recognise the importance of improve communication and multi discipline team have lot less time than think also wish to mention free breakfast club and the school uniform saving that will benefit parent and young people in my constituency who be struggle because of the cost of living crisis genuinely believe that that measure will help they as it be an issue that definitely come up in my constituency with time so short will focus on the three area that my constituent raise with most frequently we have hear about they today first be the introduction of free breakfast club which be the late in long line of manifesto commitment that we have keep over the past six month despite objection and comment from conservative members that provision will guarantee that no child have to start the day hungry and it also create an extra minute of childcare which will allow parent to be flexible with their work arrangement the second area my hon friend the member for lichfield dave robertson speak passionately about this be the limit that the bill place on the number of brand item that school can require parent to purchase for their child that limit will now be three this be exactly the right thing to do school uniform can get expensive as it be and no child or parent should be deter from choose school because of the cost of its uniform the third issue relate to child who be not in school the bill will create register of child who be not in school so that local authority will be in position to ensure that all child be be teach in suitable environment this be excellent work it be minimum standard and it be absolutely require have be approach by constituent who home school and they do an excellent job they want to share some concern with which promise would raise with the relevant minister so hope she will excuse as take the opportunity to do that now first when the register be introduce what safeguard will be in place to ensure that hacker and other who try to breach the security of the local authority can not access they of course the answer might not be forthcoming today they might come in committee secondly what will be do to ensure that all local authority take the same approach to the register so that we do not get hundred of different approach to collect datum finally what clarification can the minister provide on what intervention from the council will take place when it deem it appropriate to do so what will the guidance look like finally my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion have already state clearly in non party political way why we must not vote for the conservatives wreck amendment today she have already be through the national inquiry that have take place which have already produce recommendation none of which have be implement the time for word be over the time for action be now that be why be proud to vote for the bill today warmly welcome the bill and the secretary of state commitment to tackle the send crisis in our school crisis that develop over more than decade of neglect and which will not be resolve overnight the bill proposal to introduce duty for local authority to keep register of child who be not in school be cause concern among family with child who have special educational need and disability in my constituency the concern be base not on the bill but on the battle that parent find themselves fight in order to ensure that their child need be meet as survivor of the send jungle understand the state of perpetual worry that family live with and understand that they be fearful that the introduction of register may result in increase pressure from the local authority for their child to attend school without the support they need last year see increase in the number of request for education health and care plan in scarborough and whitby from the previous year and almost of decision on ehcp take six month or long leave child without the support they need while wait if child do receive an ehcp parent often feel that the provision offer do not correspond to their need as there be shortage of key professional and funding be often pool rather than use for the one to one support that they really need in my experience parent do not take the decision to withdraw their child from school lightly one constituent have face fine for her son non attendance that she can not afford to pay and problem at work because he be at home another constituent karen who run the marvellous charity closer communities in scarborough which support family in this situation have struggle to get appropriate support for her own son karen who be senior manager in the nhs be force to put her own career on hold which inevitably have financial implication for her family withdraw child from school be not easy and can have major impact on family most would prefer for their child to be educate in mainstream school where they get the support they need be proud that the government be work hard to ensure that that happen in the future with more targeted mainstream provision hope that the secretary of state can reassure parent like those have describe that they have nothing to fear from the legislation will she consider whether the register could be use to distinguish between parent who home school by choice and those who do so because they have no choice every child deserve the good possible start in life no matter their background or where they live and this bill be vital step towards ensure that for every child in the country the bill address ordinary family concern cut the cost of the basic need for school and ensure that every child have what they need to learn the bill be also the most significant piece of child protection legislation in generation it will protect the most vulnerable child and family the introduction of free school breakfast club in all primary school be significant step in support child learning and wellbee be also pleased to see the cap on brand uniform item include in the legislation too often the cost of uniform be prohibitive in morecambe and lunesdale we have huge uniform hub to try to deal with that problem additionally the bill step to regulate home education be crucial to stop vulnerable child from fall through the crack the introduction of register for child not in school will ensure great safeguard particularly for those who may be at risk of exploitation or neglect it be vital that every child have access to safe high quality education regardless of where that be give also welcome measure to crack down on illegal school where unfortunately we have see many serious case of abuse include sexual abuse measure in the bill will protect child from both poor schooling and the use of illegal school to terrorise child put on record my thank to humanists uk which have lead campaign for over decade to crack down on illegal school and have shine light on some really horrific practice thank the secretary of state for give and other mps time to discuss the detail of the bill include definition of what full time mean in the legislation and potential concern have about open up gap to avoid the cap on faith selection with little time leave want to put forward personal view on faith selection in school it should have no place in state fund education it be social selection by proxy and at the very least would like to see firm commitment to keep the cap on all school give child the very good start in life safe start where they have every opportunity to achieve their full potential be vital this bill support that it introduce more robust measure to help keep child safe and it raise standard and opportunity in school so that child receive high quality holistic education it cover huge number of area more than could meaningly address in the short time have available so will focus on the national curriculum introduce in by kenneth baker the national curriculum be one of handful of significant and progressive education reform of the opposition members should be more proud of it it provide the statutory standard for school subject lesson content and attainment level for state school in england however it be not compulsory for academy that make sense when academy be introduce in the early noughtie because in community where there be significant level of unmet need and low aspiration it allow school leader the freedom to devise programme of learning that help to address the acute and embed challenge that young people in those community face after the decline and lack of investment in school during the and early by may when the last labour government leave office there be of those academy now there be over follow significant expansion of the programme support the concept of academy ah do support the concept of academy they be great legacy of the previous government but because those school do not have to follow the national curriculum some be game the system by not teach full holistic programme of subject there have be massive decline over the number of art entry at gcse since some school offer no art subject at all at gcse level that matter for our economy and the uk stand around the world and for who we be as individual how we understand the world and how we interact with each other welcome the bill measure to provide more holistic education to child also want to speak briefly about breakfast club they will be very welcome in derbyshire because derbyshire county council increase the cost of school dinner by last year on top of what they already cost for parent that will help with the cost of living crisis but ask that the minister make sure that as we implement this legislation provide it go through we have the right check and balance in place to ensure that local authority such as derbyshire where ofsted find serious issue with send be fulfil their statutory obligation to ensure that child who rely on home to school transport can access breakfast club call the shadow minister over the past year we have have something that be quite unusual in politic degree of cross party consensus about education in england school in england have be improve by the magic formula of freedom plus accountability it start in the late be accelerate after by labour and be accelerate far under the lib dem conservative government in and it work england improve not just compare with the rest of the world but compare with scotland and wales where the opposite agenda be follow academy be ban league table be abandon and progressive curriculum be instal between and england go from to in the pisa league table on math while wales go from to on science england go from to while wales slump from to as the institute for fiscal studies point out in searing report title major challenge for education in wales amazingly disadvantaged child in england be now do well than the average child in wales early the secretary of state talk about what the bill would do for the work class we have see what labour agenda have do for the work class in wales it be similar story in scotland which collapse from to in math and from to in science other comparison tell we the same the trend in international mathematic and science study find that from to england ranking be all maintain or improve to become among the good in the western world meanwhile what happen in scotland and wales we do not know because they withdraw from the test after bad result in yet despite all that evidence the bill in front of we today take we backwards never mind the thing we do the government be undo the good thing that the last labour government do as educator have point out it be totally unclear what problem minister think they be try to fix but it be clear that it will cause problem because it take away academy freedom and start roll back the academy programme one important freedom that the bill take away be the freedom to pay more on top of the national salary scale to retain more good teacher the big school trust in the country united learning use those freedom to pay above the figure set out in the government national term the leader of that trust the former dfe official sir jon coles have warn that what the government be plan will be damaging and will make it hard to retain good teacher school employ at least teacher will be hit by the end of this freedom even the government have sort of recognise the problem say we recognise the good practice that academy trust have develop over the year but good practice should be limit by administrative structure this be bizarre if it be good practice why be the government not extend those freedom to all school rather than take they away from academy the dfe be try to say that their new law will not affect teacher pay why then be the government pass it what be the point of it if it be so good why have they tell schools week that it will not apply to senior staff minister be compound the problem by take away freedom over qts about teacher do not have qts at the moment and lot of those who enter state education without qts about year go on to get it however the fact that teacher can join state school without have it up front reduce the barrier to entry and make it easy to recruit to state school the treasury estimate that this policy will cost school up to million for the exist stock of teacher and million for the flow of new teacher each year but there will be no compensation for this cost the bill also end academy freedom to vary from the national curriculum this freedom promote genuine diversity in our school not all child learn in the same way and parent can currently choose what be right for their child it also protect educator from endless meddling by well mean politician and interest group in scotland the imposition of the ironically name but disastrous curriculum for excellence have be one of the main reason why scotland school have plummet down the international league table many school will now have to spend lot of time churn through labour brand new curriculum to work out whether they comply it be another move away from culture of teacher empowerment and towards tick box compliance culture and backwards move what problem be minister try to fix here they have admit in write answer that they do not even know how many school will be affect by this policy it be bizarre they be leap without even bother to look as well as cut back all those other freedom the bill also give the secretary of state terrifying sweep new power to boss academy about on any subject of her choosing where she think school be behave unreasonably as well as take away school freedom and leave we with academy in name only the bill also hack back the academy programme in do so it hack back accountability which have always be the flipside of school freedom in one of labour first move be to publish list of fail school and start intervene in they after try other thing it become apparent that the good way to intervene be to make the school academy and put they under new management this bill of course abolish the academy order under which fail local authority school be turn into academy the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh in her superb speech give great explanation of why abandon this central blair era reform be such mistake of course the very good way to turn around struggle school be to make it part of strong trust however the government have abolish the academy grant and the trust capacity grant that support this process they hope instead that bit of advice from some dfe official will do the trick of turn around fail school but that centralist approach have be try and it fail the bill take we back to local authority set up new school which at well set up messy situation however be particularly nervous about it in the context of the other measure in the bill which reverse the reform of the late those reform for the first time enable the good school to grow unshackle they from local authority and usher in the era of parental choice which be itself powerful motor for school improvement clause give local authority the ability to object if good school want to grow or even if the academy be propose to keep its publish admission number the same in the context of fall pupil number it will be tempting for local authority to prop up unpopular school particularly local authority run one by share out the pupil from more successful school rather than the normal split between regulator and provider local authority will be both politician in some local authority have never like school freedom and it will be very tempting for they to push down number in academy to protect the school they run early we hear the former labour leader the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn welcome the bill for exactly that reason the same reason he welcome it be the reason parent be right to fear it the bill be massive step backwards there be huge real issue that need tackle in school but the bill do not help with they and in lot of case hinder they our reason amendment today make this clear will the shadow minister give way be press for time so will see if can get to the hon lady at the end our amendment be also the first opportunity that mps will have during the bill proceeding to vote for proper national inquiry into the grooming gang as the bill go through we will seek to make further amendment to ensure that this much need inquiry happen the current discussion start when oldham ask for national inquiry into what happen there it do so because local inquiry would not have the power need it can not summon witness can not take evidence under oath and can not requisition evidence we have already see the two man who lead the greater manchester local investigation resign because they be be block yet the government say no to national inquiry and say that there should instead be local inquiry but there have be year over which they should have happen and they have not happen in many case the local official be part of the problem and even part of the cover up so they can not be the people to fix this interruption member be chuntere from sedentary position but take for example the case of keighley where my hon friend the member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore have be call for an inquiry for year interruption last night while ministers be here say that there should be local inquiry in keighley they be block local inquiry even as they speak so that be not the answer the government hide behind the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse it be an important first step but what it be not and never intend to be be report on the grooming gang it barely touch on they it look at half dozen just half dozen place where grooming gang have operate but there be to place where groom gang operate and the voice of the victim in those place have never be hear interruption have proper national inquiry do not stop anyone get on and implement the recommendation of the jay report indeed one of the recommendation of the jay report recommendation be to increase public awareness without national inquiry it be clear that we will not get to the bottom of this issue and that the people who look the other way or cover up will not be hold to account so far how many people in authority have be bring to justice or hold to account the answer be zero interruption tonight we have chance to change that order be go to allow the shadow minister to finish but will hear he he be perfectly within his right if he choose not to give way thank you madam deputy speaker some people really do not want to hear the voice of the victim interruption even though no one in authority have be hold to account the government seem to think that there be nothing further to be learn do not think that be right this afternoon the under secretary of state for the home department the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips say that there should national inquiry if victim want one victim be call for one so what be we wait for there be real challenge that we should be face recruitment discipline and attendance instead we have bill that just take we backwards as one of the nation lead educator sir daniel moynihan say today on world at one we be worried in the sector about what the problem be that the change be design to fix we can offer well pay it not clear why constrain that solve problem why academy should be constrain beat we hop that some of this will be amend it would be terrible shame if the reform that labour introduce over year ago be water down likewise the confederation of school trusts be warn that the loss of academy freedom propose in the bill risk make it more difficult for trust to do the hard work of improve school in the most challenging circumstance remember what state school be like in the and in my school it be chaotic with load of fight discredit progressive teaching method fail kid and good teacher be grind down interruption you think it be funny but the life chance of the kid be at school with be flush away by your disastrous ideology interruption order the shadow minister will know that do not flush away any child life chance perhaps he be bring his remark to conclusion be on happy note also get to see the good of state education go to an amazing sixth form that benefit from the freedom that the conservative government give it pay tribute to the inspire principal of that college kevin conway who help so many kid in huddersfield in his lifetime see what state education could be see the good of it freedom work madam deputy speaker and would not be here today if it do not be heartbroken by the bill it genuinely trash the cross party reform that we have have over year we can see they have work yet we be trash they be beg minister beg they to change their mind contrary to the doom and gloom that we have just hear there have be fantastic

country apologise if be not able to respond to all the point that have be raise there be huge number of they and we will have an opportunity to debate all those issue in the week ahead this

rethink their plan to close the grimsby post office and take it off the at risk register the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to take immediate action to ensure that the grimsby post office remain open to continue to provide incredibly important service to resident in the town and the petitioner remain etc trial of lucy letby before call the whip to move the motion for the adjournment remind the house that although there be currently no live proceeding before the court there be still the potential for further civil or criminal proceeding member will therefore wish to take care to avoid say anything that could prejudice any case that might come before the court in future motion make and question propose that this house do now wakeford be not in the habit of issue trigger warning but must warn the house that this speech will cover deeply distress event will discuss infant death failure in care and allegation of grave miscarriage of justice lucy letby be convict of murder seven infant and attempt to murder seven more she receive multiple concurrent full life sentence the case horrify the nation it seem clear nurse have turn into serial killer initially accept the tabloid characterisation of letby as an evil monster but then be approach by many expert include lead statistician neonatal specialist forensic scientist legal expert and those who have serve at the chester hospital and be afraid to come forward the expert include past president of the royal statistical society and past president of the royal college of paediatrics and child health people who be more knowledgeable than the purport expert whose evidence convict lucy letby they be all concerned by what they perceive as the false analysis and diagnosis use to persuade lay jury to convict letby sadly none of we be stranger to miscarriage of justice there have simply be too many the birmingham six the guildford four and the stockwell six be the famous one but the exeter university miscarriage database list nearly people who have be wrongfully imprison astonishingly wrong forensic evidence be responsible for case lead to over year of unjust imprisonment many of those case involve caregiver convict by medical expert testimony assert deliberate harm where cause of death be in fact natural those people be all exonerate but those who doubt their guilt be initially meet with the same fierce public pushback that now face those who question letby guilt so what have happen here the countess of chester hospital neonatal unit suffer sharp increase in death from typical two to four year to in one month period when hospital senior management become aware of the elevated mortality in june they be alarmed and commission some investigation the most notable be carry out in november by the royal college of paediatrics and child health whose report note many failing on the unit all of which at least in part if not in total could have be the cause of the death the report highlight inadequate staffing level delay escalation of concern to tertiary unit and disconnection between the neonatal leadership and the trust government and risk management process in essence because of mixture of inadequate resource and poor medical management the hospital be not capable of keep those very fragile baby alive that fact be recognise by the hospital when the neonatal unit be downgrade in july and stop take baby of less than week gestation the report offer completely different reason for the death be never show to the jury some consultant have attempt to blame letby for the death redacted section of the report state the consultant explain that their allegation be base on nurse be on shift on each occasion an infant die although not necessarily care for the infant combine with gut feeling there be no other evidence or history to link nurse to the death and her colleague have express no concern about her practice will the right hon gentleman give way no be afraid will not be short of time again that section of the report be never show to the jury those consultant then persuade management to call the police in april there be no hard evidence against letby nobody see she do anything untoward the doctor gut feeling be base on coincidence she be on shift for number of the death but and this be important far from all of they the case be build on poor understanding of probability that be to translate later into an influential but spectacularly flawed piece of evidence around that time the hospital be struggle with another problem and possibly more sensible explanation for this sudden increase in death leak report show that the hospital and specifically the neonatal unit battle pseudomonas aeruginosa infection for month that antibiotic resistant bug pose serious risk to the baby the child mortality rate for pseudomonas aeruginosa range from to and stand at over for infant of extremely low birth weight such as those in this case it be hard to see how we can eliminate that as the cause of death or collapse for at least some of those baby again the jury never know about that contamination from the start of the case cheshire police pick up on the doctor statistical argument supposedly point to letby in april an officer on the investigation approach lead statistician professor jane hutton and ask she to put figure on the likelihood of nurse be on duty during all the death collapse in the unit of course that be false proposition as letby be not on duty for anything like all the death as we will see later but that be glossed over at the trial notwithstanding that professor hutton inform the police that any proper statistical inquiry should not concentrate on one staff member from the outset instead it would require full proper research into all possible explanation for any increase in baby collapse include their medical condition and prematurity as well as the broad performance of the unit one would think that would be common sense cheshire police then sign consultancy agreement with professor hutton but in after letby have be charge the police write an email to professor hutton state we have have further meeting this afternoon where we have inform the prosecutor that we be look at the validity of statistical evidence again in the case the prosecutor have instruct we not to pursue this avenue any far at present this appear to be in direct contravention of part of the code for crown prosecutor which state prosecutor can not direct the police or other investigator again the jury be never inform of professor hutton explicit advice to the police that their statistical approach be flawed this matter enormously because the most powerfully influential piece of evidence in the case be the prosecution king counsel show table with letby list as the only nurse on duty for all of the allege murder and inflict injury professor hutton who have review the case extensively believe that deeply flawed statistical evidence be use and have say that the statistical error be similar to those in the sally clark case but bad sally clark be convict and then acquit of the murder of her two son base on flawed statistical evidence in may dewi evans retired doctor who run business that provide highly pay medical expert evidence in court case approach the national crime agency to volunteer his service evans opinion that letby inject air either into the baby vein cause air embolism or down the nasogastric tube into the stomach stop the baby breathing be one of the foundation indeed probably the major foundation of the prosecution case this suppose evidence be hugely controversial three month into the murder trial letby defence team apply for evidence from dewi evans to be exclude due to an adverse judgment from judge in previous case who say that report by dr evans be worthless and make no effort to provide balanced opinion in an extraordinary and as far as can see unprecedented intervention that very judge lord justice jackson actually write to the trial judge with his judgment on dr evans attach clearly indicate how unsuitable evans be as an expert witness evans assertion of murder by air embolism be entirely base on research paper from and its relevance in these case have be robustly challenge by the actual author of that paper evans change his opinion on several key issue during the trial and be now accuse by letby lawyer of change his opinion again since the end of the appeal process evans dispute this but if member be interested suggest that they compare his evidence record in the trial transcript of november with his sign statement to channel on august and decide for themselves it be also the case that evans have submit new report to the police what be extraordinary however be that the crown prosecution service have refuse to provide copy of that report to letby current defence counsel question have also be raise about the second expert witness for the prosecution dr sandie bohin eight family be currently file formal complaint against she over their child care which be be consider by the general medical council that bring we to the actual case and cause of the death two expert neonatologist consultant working neonatologist be work through the case to establish the actual cause of the baby deterioration and death they be do so thoroughly so this be take time so far they have complete two detailed case review for baby and there be five more that will be complete in the near future in the case of baby the prosecution claim the baby be attack with blunt trauma to the liver and have air inject into the nasogastric tube the case note tell different story show how the doctor use excessive ventilation pressure during resuscitation which overinflate the baby lung and prevent blood from flow back to the lung this cause the baby to desaturate his blood oxygen level repeatedly the medical team respond by increase the pressure even more initiate downward spiral in the baby condition the overinflation of the baby lung force the diaphragm downward push the liver into the baby abdominal cavity the consultant in charge take decision to insert needle into the abdomen to release what they think be gas pressure in the abdomen however this be wrongly insert into the right side of the baby abdomen as result of this error the needle penetrate the liver cause serious internal bleeding this be undoubtedly significant contributory factor in the baby death if not the outright cause the report state that the deterioration be predictable and his death be avoidable and result from suboptimal care the author of that sub optimal care the doctor who insert the needle into the liver be one of the principal accuser of lucy letby at the trial this directly contradict the prosecution portrayal of event the trauma to the liver be cause by serious error by one of the consultant who lead the accusation against letby the expert also state that there be no air in the gut in excess of what would be expect for baby in these circumstance none of this be make clear to the jury the prosecution evidence be again predicate on dewi evans diagnosis which in this specific case alone change multiple time in the case of baby the prosecution claim this be healthy baby kill by air be inject into his stomach the case note for baby demonstrate that this baby be actually profoundly unwell before birth the baby suffer from severe foetal growth restriction this mean the baby have to be deliver by caesarean section at an extraordinarily low birth weight even for that gestation of gram or about lb within an hour of birth he develop respiratory distress to treat the respiratory problem they try to deliver surfactant mixture that help baby lung to expand well open up down an endotracheal tube the case note however show that the doctor push the tube too far in push it into one lung mean that the other lung be leave collapse in the day after the baby birth he show several sign of abdominal obstruction include the vomiting of bile and he never open his bowel since birth which the doctor in charge do not recognise or diagnose the report conclude by state that this baby die of natural cause compound by sub optimal medical care this again directly contradict the prosecution narrative of deliberate harm dewi evans diagnosis claim the baby have air inject into the stomach so he could no long breathe this be predicate on an ray show an unusual amount of air on the stomach it have become clear that letby be not even at the hospital when the ray be take nor have she be at any point till then since baby birth two day early while the baby die from natural cause there be evidence of sub optimal care include the administration of surfactant and the lack of recognition and appropriate management of sign of abdominal obstruction again the doctor responsible for these error be another one of those who make accusation against lucy letby and again none of this be make clear to the jury there be great deal of evidence demonstrate that there be much more likely alternative cause of these tragic death than those put up by the prosecute team the most likely be that the hospital neonatal unit be not up to care for these fragile child in term of either resource or skill and this shortcoming might have be compound by other factor such as the pseudomonas infection my right hon friend will be aware that there be family connection with my constituency of hereford and south herefordshire what he say be deeply troubling and distress on so many different level and would like to ask whether his conclusion be that there be some case in justice to consider this an unsafe verdict there be case in justice for retrial in my view but there be problem would say it be technical problem one of the problem we face be that much of the evidence be available at the time what have describe be an expert analysis of the case note that be there at the time but it be simply not present to the jury that mean that the court of appeal can dismiss it basically say that the defence should have present it at the initial trial it be in essence say if your defence team be good enough to present this evidence hard luck you stay bang up for life that may be judicially convenient but it be not justice this have be historic problem in britain delay the resolution of number of miscarriage of justice case secondly the so call expert evidence in this case largely amount to put together theory suit the prosecution case from the bogus statistical argument through to the wrong diagnosis have just detail again this problem be not new in the law commission make number of recommendation precisely on the handling of expert evidence there be even section in it entitle inferring murder from unexplained infant death those recommendation have not make it into law nearly year later and it be past time that be put right perhaps most worrying of all in this case be that it be just the late example more than decade after the mid staffs scandal of the national health service inability to analyse its own failing this matter because until we learn these lesson there will continue to be unnecessary death in hospital up and down the country my central argument today which come back to what my right hon friend ask be about what to do about trial which in my view be clear miscarriage of justice by judicial system that could not manage admittedly difficult statistical and medical scientific evidence the only body available to correct this today be the criminal cases review commission in my view it should look at all the new diagnosis when they come out and if necessary consult the lead neonatal and statistical authority in the land the most expert people who be much more equipped to give proper assessment than the expert who be employ by the police at the time as result in my view it should order retrial and it should do it quickly this be significant because the ccrc have recently be criticise member may have read about it in the andrew malkinson case where there be effectively year delay in release he from prison dna evidence prove he innocent of the rape he be convict of be know four year after his conviction yet it take further year to correct it that can not happen again we can not repeat that if as believe it will retrial clear lucy letby she should be release in her thirty not in her fifty thank the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis for secure this debate first want to acknowledge the impact on the family that any debate surround this case may have as lady justice thirlwall state at the outset of her inquiry much of this debate have come from people who be not present throughout the trial to hear the evidence in full the parent have be wait long time for answer and it be important whatever may be say here this evening that we agree that we must work towards deliver closure for those family who be go through unimaginable and intolerable grief it be an important principle of the rule of law that the government do not interfere with judicial decision in this case the court of appeal have carefully consider the argument before it and deliver its judgment give that and the ongoing police investigation it would be inappropriate for to comment on miss letby case specifically but will outline the principle and procedure regard expert witness and appeal will the minister give way will not as unfortunately we be tight on time my apology first in the area of expert evidence the criminal procedure rule apply the common law principle that govern the admissibility of expert witness and provide structured framework for expert witness and the court to follow they cover expert witness and how medical report be commission and the criminal practice directions provide detailed guidance on expert evidence all of those be follow for every criminal proceeding where it be relevant like all criminal procedure rule they be regularly review by the criminal procedure rule committee the committee be make up of legal expert appoint by the lord chancellor in consultation with the lady chief justice and its role be to make the criminal justice system as accessible fair and efficient as possible the rule outline that expert evidence be admissible only if the witness be competent to give that opinion and the expert opinion be sufficiently reliable to be admit they far state that the expert witness must provide the court with the necessary scientific criterion against which to judge their conclusion and must give notice of anything that might undermine the reliability of the evidence or detract from the impartiality or credibility of their evidence expert witness be require to sign declaration of truth to that effect the right to fair trial by jury in the most serious case be fundamental principle of the justice system it be design to protect the right of the defendant and to ensure thorough examination of the evidence that include the presentation of evidence by both the prosecution and the defence the examination and cross examination of witness and the impartial judgment of the jury where scientific evidence be present the judiciary utilise judicial primer write by lead scientist peer review by scientist and legal practitioner and approve by the council of the royal society and the royal society of edinburgh while note the concern raise about the trial process as set out the jury consider all the evidence put before they and make their determination secondly turn to the appeal process in the criminal justice system follow miss letby first permission to appeal application the court of appeal hear legal argument over several day on number of ground and issue detailed page judgment set out why permission to appeal be refuse that include the trial judge handling of the argument raise by the defence as to dr evans evidence it be not appropriate for or the government to comment on judicial process nor on the reliability of conviction or evidence furthermore the criminal justice system provide route through the criminal cases review commission for those who believe that they have be wrongfully convict and the appeal system have be exhaust the ccrc be an independent body and it review any application make to it accord to its statutory role and procedure its role be to investigate case where people believe they have be wrongly convict and to refer case back to the court of appeal where it believe that there be real possibility of conviction not be uphold miss letby as with any other convict person who maintain their innocence follow refusal to appeal be able to apply to the ccrc the decision on whether to seek review from the ccrc be matter for miss letby and her legal team thirdly it be relevant to take into account that the thirlwall inquiry be establish in october chair by lady justice thirlwall one of the country most senior judge and that that be ongoing the inquiry be purposefully set up to be independent from government and it will play an important role in identify learning follow event at the countess of chester hospital contribute to the future of patient safety it will cover the experience of the parent of the baby name in the indictment the conduct of staff management and governance process and the effectiveness of governance external scrutiny and the professional regulation of keep baby in hospital safe include consideration of the nhs culture the inquiry will examine not the conviction but rather the response of individual within the trust base on what they know or should have know at the time of the event when they occur lady justice thirlwall make that clear in her remark when open the hearing statutory inquiry can not apportion civil or criminal liability and will not review the jury finding it be of course open to the expert to contact the inquiry directly and seek to participate through the provision of evidence for the inquiry consideration it be then for the chair to manage the inquiry as she consider appropriate to deliver the public term of reference which be agree in consultation with the family and other stakeholder the chair will consider all relevant available evidence when draw conclusion and when write her report and recommendation in due course give the importance of the inquiry be sure it be appreciate that it must have space to gather evidence from the various stakeholder and to draw its own finding without ministerial involvement the criminal justice system have well establish process and procedure for how expert evidence be use and route to challenge if any individual include miss letby maintain their innocence set aside what the right hon gentleman have put forward have be make aware that some nhs staff question their culpability and their ability to do their job that be how they feel some nhs staff have leave the profession simply because of their concern ask the minister gently what can be do to restore the confidence of nhs staff particularly the nurse the hon member make an important intervention it be important that all individual in public life feel that they can speak openly and with duty of candour that be why the lady thirlwall inquiry will look at the culture in the nhs more broadly this government be commit to bring forward hillsborough law which will look at duty of candour to ensure that individual in public life tell the truth it be not safe for or the government to undermine any of the process in the justice system our attention should rightly remain on the family and parent impact by this case and on continue to work towards provide answer and closure for they it be to the family that speak to the thirlwall inquiry will play key role in this question put and agree to house adjourn
