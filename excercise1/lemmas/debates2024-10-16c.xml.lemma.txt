important role that million of family carer play in provide support for disabled or elderly relative who need care at home echo those comment and add my own tribute to all family carer much of their tireless work go unseen and unrecognised like other member be privileged to witness glimpse of carer dedication through my correspondence and through event attend in my constituency run through today debate be an underlying and understandable anger at the position we inherit from the last government whereby family carer try to do the right thing have be leave with staggering overpayment often run into thousand of pound as my hon friend the member for birkenhead alison mcgovern set out early we be make sure that we understand precisely what have go wrong so that we can put the system right for the long term our family carer deserve no less many member include the hon member for eastleigh liz jarvis and for north east fife wendy chamberlain my hon friend the members for shipley anna dixon and for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis and the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone and of course my hon friend the member for city of durham mary kelly foy and the right hon member for kingston and surbiton speak about their own experience as carer or the work they do locally to support organisation help family carer grow up watch my grandmother care for my grandad struggle with parkinson disease before later see my mum one of the many hidden carer up and down the land care for her mother my nana in her final year battle alzheimer disease none of we in this house be blind to the work that carer do they be fortunate to have some wonderful advocate those include their mp as we have see today but also organisation such as carers uk the carers trust and the learning and work institute to name but three the minister for social security and disability my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms and have already meet delegation of carer and carers uk and he will be do so again shortly he will also meet separately with the carers trust and the learning and work institute because we be determined to ensure that the voice of family carer and the organisation support they be at the heart of everything we do also want to pay tribute to the hundred of dwp staff largely base in the north west who provide financial support to million family carer through carer allowance day in day out the government will spend record amount to support unpaid carer real term expenditure on carer allowance be forecast to rise from billion in to just over billion year by turn to some of the other point raise during the debate with apology that time will permit to address only some of they let take the opportunity to congratulate and pay tribute to my hon friend the members for clwyd north gill german and for weston super mare dan aldridge and the hon member for torbay steve darling on their excellent maiden speech they paint vivid picture of their constituency and feel certain that they will go on to make significant contribution in this place on the wide point will begin with the question of the adequacy of carer allowance set as it be at per week carer allowance will be increase in april by the consumer price index to help ensure that it maintain its value as well as carer allowance carer in low income household can claim income relate benefit such as universal credit and pension credit those can be pay to carer at high rate than to those without care responsibility through the carer element and the additional amount for carer respectively for example over carer household on universal credit can already receive an additional year through the carer element that say the house should be aware that issue beyond the scope of the independent review announce today be not be ignore this be merely first step towards progress the government be also look at the broad question of how to provide the good possible support for family carer although do not want to pre empt that work today let turn to the question of taper which be raise by number of right hon and hon member at the moment introduce taper in carer allowance would significantly complicate the benefit with award have to be adjust manually on weekly basis for some of those declare earning that would add to administrative cost and could mean more fraud and error those also receive universal credit would need to have that adjust if their payment of carer allowance change because of an earning taper rate taper could be introduce only follow significant change to the it system that support payment of carer allowance for the moment therefore it be not possible on the potential writing off of overpayment which be at the heart of many of the excellent contribution that we hear an overpayment can occur through fraud or through claimant or official error the secretary of state have an obligation to protect public fund and ensure that wherever possible overpayment be recover but determine what good we can do to support those who have accrue overpayment be within the scope of the independent review as be how such overpayment occur and what we can do to ensure that we take all the step we can to reduce the risk of such incident happen again let turn briefly to the comment of the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for central devon mel stride he list the many intervention that the last government supposedly make to improve the lot of carer seemingly include the private member bill of the hon member for north east fife but after year of conservative government we see carer who find themselves in heartbreaking situation have rack up huge overpayment however the right hon gentleman correctly set out the incredibly complex nature of the carer allowance system with allowance for legitimate expense pension contribution and so on and why resolve this matter be therefore not straightforward that be why the independent review be the correct mechanism and next step to fully understand what go wrong and why and how we can put thing right welcome his support for the review many colleague refer to the role that family carer play in ease pressure on the social care system and indeed in support our economy and they be entirely right to do so acknowledge everything that carer do they be hero we appreciate how much society rely on unpaid carer we recognise the challenge they face and we understand the need for change support carer be both moral and an economic imperative so we will help carer stay in pay work we be spend record amount on carer allowance and we will sort out the overpayment scandal we inherit that be why we have announce the independent review today so that together we can rebuild the trust that have be lose and ensure that those who offer comfort dignity and support to the one they love be give all the help they need in return hope right hon and hon member will acknowledge that work today by support the government amendment question put standing order no that the original word stand part of the question
