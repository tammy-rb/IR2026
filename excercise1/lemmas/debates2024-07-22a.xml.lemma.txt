strickland focus with great pride on the hitachi rail company in his constituency shortly be afraid to tell he to be seize by the labour party and nationalise as part of its government programme my hon friend the member for farnham and bordon greg stafford stress defence spending the hon member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake leasehold reform and the hon member for south antrim

tribute to david morris and his support for the eden project and be particularly pleased to see she do that the hon member for north down alex easton make think one of the most moving maiden speech

attempt to join we here in the house of commons the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins reference the fact that roman road watle street run through her constituency and speak passionately about the importance of community and tolerance finally the hon member for north durham luke akehurst speak warmly of kevan jones whom all of we who have be in this house for while remember with great fondness and the importance of skilled and well pay job in his constituency hope that have pretty much covered everybody and say the main thing that need say let we now turn to the debate itself and it seem to that the right hon member for leeds west and pudsey rachel reeves while congratulate she warmly on be the first female chancellor think that be huge achievement and be to be very warmly welcome be be afraid suffer from some level of amnesia she appear to have forget the legacy that we have bequeath to she inflation which be up at over last autumn be now back to target mortgage rate be soften real wage have be grow in each of the last month and taxis have be come down more recently under the previous government when it come to debt we be on target as we hand over to the right hon lady to see debt fall in line with her own fiscal target at the end of the fifth year and we of course have the fast grow economy in the one wonder where this amnesia be come from and it be of course nothing more than smoke and mirror it be to cover up the fact that the chancellor be roll the pitch to raise taxis against all the commitment she make during the general election she will be raise those taxis in the autumn it will not be because we have bequeath she something of which she be not aware in advance the ifs have make it very clear that the book be open as paul johnson say for all to see when it come to public service we have proud record on education we have the good reader in the western world we have be go up the pisa scale for mathematic and science something that do not happen under the last labour government crime have be halve broadly speak across the period from to the present day when it come to work and welfare we have near record level of employment and we have low level of unemployment and economic inactivity be low than in every single year under the last labour government what be labour record when they leave office unemployment be double the level that it be today under every single labour government in history unemployment have be high when they leave office than when they come in most disgraceful of all be that youth unemployment be up under the last labour government under the last conservative government it be down by over as for welfare under labour there be million people languish on long term benefit for almost decade on pension we see the pension increase and the gordon brown raid on private pension of billion from which the pension system never fully recover it be therefore no surprise that under labour we end up with the fourth high level of pensioner poverty across europe under labour there be million more people in absolute poverty after housing cost there be more pensioner in poverty and more child in poverty under the last labour government than there be today we will be responsible opposition we welcome the commitment to growth in the king speech we welcome the commitment to build house as long as that be with sufficient local consent we welcome the budget responsibility bill in principle and we welcome the announcement that the chancellor have make regard pension consolidate pension and ensure that we get well return for pensioner and that we invest in long term pension capital but there be too many echo in this king speech of the labour of old the nationalisation of the railway the consolidation of gb energy the long hand of government member hear hear labour members cheer now but they will be cheer in few year time they have short memory remember when the railway be nationalise and it be not pretty situation they be bring forward french style employment law that will lead to less efficient business and to tribunal they will be increase the freedom of trade union who be their paymaster and they will be dispense with minimum service level that will lead to more strike and the inconvenience of the public but certainly not great growth what have we hear in the king speech on welfare one of the big challenge of the modern age zip absolutely nothing nada diddly squat absolutely nothing from the labour party they talk about move the national careers service from the department for education to the department for work and pensions well hardly think that will move the dial their back to work plan be name exactly as our back to work plan be that my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt the shadow chancellor and launch last autumn but it have nothing stand behind it not the billion of pound of support we put in place to encourage people to go into work and to transform life all we have hear from those on the government benches be denigration of our job centre these be describe as place of fear by the secretary of state for work and pensions and by the minister for employment the hon member for birkenhead alison mcgovern as place that do not offer real help what an insult to the ten of thousand of hard work people up and down our country who go into those office to help people improve their prospect and improve their life they be against what they call punitive sanction it will cost hundred of million of pound to remove those and it will result in less engagement with the help that be available and diminish people life chance there have be no comment whatsoever from the government benches on our work capability assessment reform that accord to the office for budget responsibility will see few people on long term sickness benefit they oppose in poetry they have to govern in prose they have not even pick up the pen but let be clear we make mistake in government and we have pay the price at the ballot box and it be right that my party now face period of reflection and do so with humility the electorate have speak and we must listen but that be not the same as say that the vision that be conservatism have die even if of late it have be too often obscure that vision still burn bright it burn bright as beacon of freedom enterprise opportunity and yes stability and hope in the face of stuart anderson stuart andrew edward argar victoria atkins gareth bacon kemi badenoch harriett baldwin steve barclay peter
