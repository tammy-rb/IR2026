reduce the reliance on direct award while retain and improve transparency and the ability to act at pace in situation similar to the covid pandemic be deeply sadden by the death of our dear friend sir tony lloyd fear that the procurement act will allow for the same horrific waste of taxpayer money and the approach to public procurement that we experience during the pandemic with friend and donor to the tory party be give the first bite of the cherry while decent local skilled business be increasingly sideline by the government approach we see that in recent analysis from the british chambers of commerce can the minister explain why small and medium sized enterprise be increasingly be sideline from access to public procurement have to take issue with number of the hon gentleman point first and foremost the idea constantly repeat by opposition members that there be special consideration for individual it be very important that we go through this yet again the hon gentleman have have answer on this twice in the past year but be go to tell he third time the simple fact of the matter be that everyone who apply for contract go through the same process very hardworking and

performance in previous contract government lawyer have advise that this can not be do but they be wrong will the government give far serious thought to block large company with terrible track record such as fujitsu from bid for future contract and if necessary legislate accordingly thank my right hon friend for his question as he will know there be clearly define circumstance in which the government can exclude company from bid for contract with regard to fujitsu he may be interested to hear that this morning the cabinet office receive letter from fujitsu voluntarily undertake not to bid for government contract while the inquiry be ongoing unless of course the government ask it to do so when it come to small and medium sized enterprise get government contract sometimes the devil

member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis the minister totally miss the point because he refer to define reason why company could be exclude the government and parliament make the rule they have be drag their foot month after month year after year on change that in this regard but also in term of support domestic industry as every other major economy do when will they sort this out and get it down to the house and into the rule over civil service intransigence and delay tactic the right hon gentleman will have hear what just say to my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis know that as lover of due process he will believe that the statutory inquiry should appropriately have the final word on this and when it do we will have absolutely no compunction in act may too convey my sympathy to the family of tony lloyd thank you mr speaker for allow we the opportunity to come together more fully as house to pay tribute thank the minister for his answer my constituent in strangford and indeed people across northern ireland include large number of small and medium sized enterprise and business they create many job wage packet and opportunity very much want to be part of this process and know the minister be keen to support we what can be do for defence procurement for example and also for the food and agriculture sector because we have great company that have the potential to do well can the minister add his support certainly can as my hon friend will know northern ireland agree to be part of the new procurement regime when we pass the procurement act which be fantastic sadly that be unlike our friend in scotland who will miss out on all the benefit of the good modern procurement framework in the world that mean that small and medium sized enterprise in his constituency will now have well opportunity to bid for government contract very much enjoy be in northern ireland at the end of last year be go again in the next few month and would be happy to meet any business that he would like to put in touch with support for female veterans what step he be take to improve support for female veteran the government will publish our first woman veteran strategy in the spring focus on the specific need of woman veteran the office for veterans affairs have provide to well understand the experience of woman veteran and to increase support for those who have experience military sexual trauma thank the right hon member for his answer will he join in recognise female veteran who not only serve themselves as know he do but support veteran in their local community such as my constituent morag lightning she be an raf veteran who volunteer as raf association welfare officer and who do too many

have leave the military often set the example for how we look after our veteran pay tribute to she and the hundred and thousand of other across the country who spend night and day help veteran welcome the woman veteran strategy and the update that the minister have give on it will the strategy take into account the finding of the review of veteran welfare service which be pleased the government carry out yes of course the review of welfare service for veteran be the most significant review that have happen ever on the statutory service of veteran affair across the ministry of defence and across government it have of course be concern of mine for some time that female veteran have not feel as include and as part of the veteran community as would want they to feel be absolutely determined to over correct that and ensure that woman veteran be look after and be as proud as be of their service and of be in the veteran community call the shadow minister the centre for military women research have identify numerous gap in our understanding of woman experience in the military the consequent problem they face and the reluctance to pursue research on those matter be it right to presume that the woman veteran strategy hear what the minister say about his genuine concern on these matter will be his main vehicle for ensure that we tackle those issue absolutely the point of the strategy essentially be to ensure that the voice that have be unheard for too long be hear know that there be unmet need and pain in the female veteran community there be also huge pride and there be extraordinary example of those who have serve and have go on to achieve extraordinary thing in their life we will of course look to achieve balance want to ensure that female veteran be correctly

as the government have start work on an artificial intelligence hit squad to eliminate civil service job and replace human labour it be of urgent importance that they lie out the safeguard they will enact the childcare benefit scandal in the netherlands in where artificial intelligence bake in racial profiling that discriminate against minority highlight the necessity of strict control and protection so will the minister reveal what step they be take to prevent the harmful use of artificial intelligence it be not the case that this be about take job off civil servant it be to enable they to do their job well and more efficiently for the benefit of the public we serve in this place in respect of the measure that we be take to ensure that we follow good practice the government central digital and data office be ensure high delivery of quality and regular testing of that software throughout all stage of development in addition there be service assessment model so we be take number of step to ensure that we guard against the risk that the hon gentleman highlight infected blood inquiry what progress his department have make on implement the interim recommendation of the

announce yesterday that the final report will be publish on may and the government be commit to update parliament on the next step within sit day of publication the publication of the final report into the infected blood scandal have yet again be delay cause dismay for hundred of people include some of my chester constituent who be still wait for justice in this matter time be precious the government commit to introduce primary legislation early in the new year to enable the establishment of the compensation scheme give that the house have show its majority support will the minister confirm that the government will now get on with it take the will of the house very seriously that vote be on december as part of the victims and prisoners bill which will now be work through its next stage in the other place the week after next have be work with colleague across government to ensure that we be able to respond appropriately at that time call father of the house the house understand that it be the minister department that have to co ordinate government and that be not an easy thing to do do he understand that sir robert francis and sir brian langstaff have make it absolutely clear that the final report will say nothing more about compensation it be not just the victim of the infected blood scandal who matter so do the family of those who have already die they be die as well may say on behalf of the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood be sure that the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson would say the same that day after the report be publish in may be too long to wait people want certainty and need support thank my hon friend for his empathy with the complexity of deliver this recognise the urgency of course that be why over the recess have several meeting with official we be move forward with the appointment of the clinical legal and care expert however recognise that his focus and that of

colleague to move this forward as quickly as can personal smartphones government business what recent assessment he have make of the prevalence of the use of personal smartphone for conduct government business by ministers and official the cabinet office do not hold datum centrally regard personal smartphone use we be committed to ensure that government business be conduct securely and to support individual in meet their security responsibility in march last year we publish guidance concern the use of non corporate communication channel for government business which set out consideration around the use of private device may be part of very small and shrink group but think it be sensible that ministers official and adviser should be able to share their thinking and thought in private on occasion however the truth of matter be that the constant drip of story whether about boris johnson nicola sturgeon or anybody else and whatsapp message not be available to hold people accountable be harm public confidence in government and politic will the minister look again at this to see how we can have good accountable and transparent government the right hon gentleman raise important point draw his attention to the document we publish last year use non corporate communication channel whatsapp private email sms for government business think he will be particularly interested in the summary table on page two honour system what step his department be take to increase transparency in the honours system we have make number of important change to increase transparency we have launch new website and online form to make it easy for anyone to make nomination we have bring the recruitment of the independent honours committee which make the honours recommendation into line with the governance code for public appointment and we have bolster probity check through new and renewed agreement with vetting body the post office scandal and paula vennells hand back of her cbe have shine real light on the need for more scrutiny and transparency in the honours system do the minister agree that the vetting process the scrutiny and transparency be need more than ever in our honours system to protect its integrity do agree give that my hon friend be former sub postmaster can fully understand why he feel so strongly about this matter he be absolutely right to do so and thank he for all the work he have do for his fellow postmaster and sub postmaster it be important that we protect the integrity of the honours system which be something to which this government be committed we have undertake range of action to strengthen check include expand criminal record check and work closely with regulator and other body to ensure full due diligence for all nominee call the shadow minister the right hon lady have just speak about the integrity of the honours system but the government have fail to be transparent around the interest of baroness mone in the ppe medpro contract where over million be waste we have no answer from the government as to why the link be not make public at the time no answer as to why government minister do not correct the wrong impression that have be give in public and no answer in response to the allegation that the government indicate national crime agency investigation would be drop if the civil claim be settle back on december labour call on the government to order an urgent investigation into this matter to give taxpayer the answer they deserve but the deputy prime minister have not even respond to the letter be the reason the government be so afraid of an investigation that it will just show once again tory sleaze we have respond you have not respond have you not have our letter have not have it will say from the dispatch box that the answer have be send and give if it need to be reissue we will do so but it have be send baroness mone have take leave of absence from the lords and there be separate investigation into the allegation against she in my mind if she be find guilty of wrongdoing she need to resign membership of the lords the public would expect no less the house of lords reform act ensure that member convict of serious offence will cease to be member of the house of the lords and that be what we want to see we do not want people in parliament who bring either house into disrepute they need to leave veteran skills what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on help to ensure potential employer recognise veteran skill and prior learning veteran employment be at an all time high with of those leave service find employment within six month we have recently launch the employer guide to hire veteran showcase good practice on how employer can benefit from veteran skill and qualification regularly champion veteran employment to cabinet colleague as employ veteran be one of the good decision that business can make be it not the case that after year of conservative government ministers have create postcode lottery for veteran and halve employment support for they specifically will the minister tell the house how many veteran have be employ as result of the civil service interview scheme for veteran when it come to veteran care in this country and how it have change in the past year it be hard to take the hon gentleman seriously those service have be transform the number of those employ through the civil service scheme be believe over but will write to he with the correct figure have job be the no factor that improve the life chance of any veteran in this country it be the real focus of what we be do at the office of veterans affairs and be incredibly proud of those effort again lament the fact that that be not reflect by labour want to see that change as we go into the next election so that veteran know that whoever win it their interest will be represent properly topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility this week sign an agreement on biological security between the united kingdom and the united states this strategic dialogue will mean share more datum collaborate on research and co ordinating action prepare for whole spectrum of biological threat also sign memorandum of co operation on cyber partnership with japan help to fulfil key element of the hiroshima accord this week the government be make available free portrait of his majesty the king available to all public building this portrait will hang in school police station and local authority serve as reminder of the country ultimate public

look into they on behalf of the hon lady last year the government trialle their emergency alert system this summer have the joy of go to south korea unfortunately be catch up in the typhoon but there be many such alert tell people where road be close or flood recently in leicestershire the like of shenton and witherley come under the cosh of flooding and my constituent be wonder whether the alert system could be use for something like this as the government website state that it can yes the service be available but it be up to local responder to determine whether to put in request for it in this case they do not do so would commend the local responder whether the environment agency the police or the fire service for their response that tool be available to they should they need it call the shadow minister echo the condolence that have be give to the family of tony lloyd far to the question about flooding yesterday the public accounts committee say that over property in england be vulnerable to flooding and the budget for flood protection be now expect to cover few property than the government originally say it would we have see the devastation that flooding can do in recent week and the terrible consequence for those affect give the cabinet office responsibility for resilience can the secretary of state explain why the plan be so far behind schedule and what the government will do to protect the property that may now be leave without adequate flood protection as the right hon gentleman highlight the cabinet office have responsibility for resilience under lead government department model but the department for environment food and rural affairs be responsible for individual flood defence we have put record sum into flood defence and we have provide record flood defence building clearly there be more to do to allocate those resource but we have make considerable progress this week gareth davies the head of the national audit office say that ministers could save up to billion year of taxpayer money by modernise it system tackle fraud and well management of major project such as he also say that out of date it expose the uk to great risk of cyber

more in tax instead of save money by get grip of these it project and major infrastructure project as have be call for by the national audit office that be precisely why we have create ai the incubator for artificial intelligence under my leadership to make sure that we apply artificial intelligence to drive down the cost of public service and to improve output say gently to the right hon gentleman that it be bit rich to be take lecture from the labour party which waste over billion when it be in government on fail it project fail it project in the nhs the ministry of defence and defra

it great deal will be write to she in due course it be complicated area of constitutional law but we appreciate the position from which she be come in light of the shocking revelation that only of the tip off receive by the government covid fraud hotline be be actively pursue can the secretary of state explain to an increasingly despairing nation what step the government be take to recover every single penny of that fraudulently claim taxpayer money that be precisely why we set up the public sector fraud authority and can update the house that in its first year it meet more than double its target in addition there be both civil and criminal investigation ongoing to bring every person responsible to justice if they have defraud the taxpayer my constituency boast the high number of veteran of any in the uk with about of people have serve but the veteran agency be not assist and other mp like in serve my constituent because when raise issue with it it insist on respond via ministerial correspondence from the ministry of defence there can therefore be no direct interface with it make it very time consume and frustrating for my constituent will the minister get the veteran agency to introduce an mps helpline so that veteran concern can be answer quickly and efficiently believe my hon friend be refer to veterans uk which be be retire because be well aware of the plethora of issue we have staff there who work incredibly hard but with very poor resource and consequently the experience of veteran have not be what want it to be we be retire that brand and completely revamp those service take on board the point about an mps hotline which exist in other departments can confirm that we be look to establish the same thing in the new organisation to meet these claim give the paymaster general answer to colleague early may remind he that sir brian langstaff say yesterday that compensation proposal be publish in april and must be deal with urgently can

the day when these service be no long require this week the head of the national audit office tell parliament that between billion and billion of annual efficiency could be achieve by well use of competition when so many area of our public service be on their knee and would benefit from that funding can the secretary of state set out what step he be take to stop this colossal waste of taxpayer

interaction between health and social care and to reduce the incidence of bed block last week we hear that no few than hospital bed in dorset be occupy by people who do not need they at cost of over

important issue of select committee power under review so that committee such as mine can continue to operate without obstruction thank my hon friend for her question the power and privilege of this house be necessary to enable parliament to function freely and fully and it be vital that select committees be able to obtain full and accurate evidence from witness as part of their inquiry that be critical the power available to this house and select committees have be under continual review and they have be investigate numerous time in the past decade it be of course very frustrating when witness do not co operate with select committees and the government support this house in assert its power to ensure that it can scrutinise effectively may say how sad we on the liberal democrat benches be that tony lloyd have pass away be councillor in rochdale when tony become the first police and crime commissioner in greater manchester he be such decent man and sincere politician and public servant warm and comfortable home be crucial to reach net zero and reduce energy bill people should be encourage to invest in energy save measure but complicated certification landscape mean

number of area and that be one of they we have have announcement on petrol retail for example in the last week shall certainly make sure that the secretary of state have hear her concern about that

particularly because of the economic impact that they can have will my right hon friend agree to have debate on how can they be restore and maintain for future generation the government recognise the importance of these often much love heritage asset that be why part of the coastal community fund be there to renovate heritage building particularly pier and lido and we have do that we have renovate an enormous number of those type of structure across the uk even sad than the pier closing be the fact that it receive million through the coastal community fund and only few year ago undergo million enhancement there be question about the use of that public money and what my hon friend local authority be do want to alert the leader of the house to action by private security firm on the wynyard estate in my constituency to stop legitimate political campaigning there be thousand of home on the estate but chris mcdonald who hope will succeed as the labour mp for stockton north be order to leave the area by guard he be tell that they do not allow cold caller and that be how they categorise labour activist the leader of the house will recognise that as anti democratic deny thousand of people the right to hear from those who seek to represent they would be oblige if she could use her office to investigate the silencing of politician and make it clear that people of whatever political colour should not be stop carry out perfectly legal activity will certainly ensure that the cabinet office have hear about that case think there be sometimes misunderstanding about the function of local councillor and member of parliament when they go door to door try to identify issue there be certain area in local authority particularly those with high volume of quite vulnerable people where cold calling zone be in place that be perfectly proper will certainly raise the matter with ministers but also encourage member to address such issue directly and locally often these thing be misunderstanding if people say what their business be in particular area hopefully such incident will not arise but will ensure that minister have hear the hon gentleman may add my word of condolence to the family of tony lloyd serve with he on the international trade committee he always make valuable contribution and will be sadly miss the rac recently publish report call on the government to commission an independent inquiry into headlight glare member will be aware that headlight on vehicle be now much bright with led light in my constituency the local paper the grimsby

tony lloyd at the appropriate time the hillsborough inquiry the post office horizon scandal windrush contaminate blood and lgbtq veteran have all be the subject of report and they be all example of how the state treat working class people when it should be there to support they victim of the last three of those scandal windrush contaminate blood and veteran be still wait for their compensation to be sort out and for the outcome of the report to be enact can we have some form of cross party arrangement whereby we can all come to an agreement on how we should respond to the report and treat those people with the dignity to which they be entitle the government be just obfuscate and kick the can down the road we know that we be at the fag end of the government but these thing need deal with now why can we not have some co operation to bring matter to conclusion for those people in last week session speak about many of the inquiry and issue that the hon gentleman raise be proud of this government record in bring forward for the first time in some instance inquiry into such matter and in make public apology on behalf of the state about some of those issue will not repeat what say early about the legislation and progress on infected blood but will repeat the statement with which end my evidence to the infected blood inquiry about why the inquiry be so important not just to comparatively small group who have be affect or infect but to all of we because it could have be any one of we anyone in the country could have be affect how the state respond to such matter be incredibly important and we all want to see justice do last week write to the cabinet office about how we could learn lesson from the series of inquiry we have set up know that the paymaster general be in regular touch with the all party group that be primarily concerned with the issue the hon gentleman raise and with the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson in addition many people in the house and other stakeholder be engage in consultation and provide their input we be determined to get these long run injustice resolve that have be our visible track record when be paymaster general admit that there be moral obligation on infected blood and set up the compensation study we will deliver on it with hope the support of opposition members send my condolence to the family and friend of tony lloyd do not know he well personally but know he well within this place he be not just well respected but well like which be quite hard for politician of such tenure he be also know to be very kind and the immeasurable difference he make to this place will last for generation recently speak to constituent who be concern about fraudster knock on door dress as if they work for commercial business with the intention to scam usually vulnerable resident will my right hon friend advise on how that issue can be address to ensure that resident feel safe when open the door to people who be supposedly sell to they may start by say how good it be to see my hon friend in his place again fit and well early we hear from an opposition member about cold call zone and measure that be put in place to protect area with high volume of vulnerable people which be one way to address the problem that my hon friend raise that be within the gift of local authority and may

from lunch club to library and from art group to youth centre to support bus service community be lose the thing that bring people together and support their life can we have debate in government time on the impact that this loss of social infrastructure be have on community and particularly on the old the young the sick the disabled and those who already face extreme poverty the hon lady will know how to apply for debate in the usual way but also draw her attention to the local government finance settlement and the offer from the secretary of state and his ministers to discuss that with member urge she to take he up on that offer if she so desire also point to the work and focus across many government departments on the issue that she raise be think in particular of the department of health

constituent kym ledgar former sub postmistress and former representative of the national federation of subpostmasters be already appal but be now incense by the story that the victim of the post office horizon scandal have to tell welcome the government commitment to complete the process of exoneration and resolve outstanding compensation claim as soon as possible but those responsible need

it could learn from horizon and from other inquiry that we have establish my hon friend may wish to raise the matter directly at the business and trade question on january there be no transport bill

bank and have support from town right across the united kingdom be sorry to hear about the situation in the hon gentleman constituency he will know that the department for levelling up housing and communities have number of programme to ensure that vital service such as those he outline be co ordinate locally and can still be access he be right that for the charity sector in particular but also

vaccine analysis from the office for national statistics publish in august last year show that people who have have vaccine have low mortality rate than those who have not be vaccinate the issue of

the hon gentleman from my experience of serve on the committees on arms export controls for those who do not know it do not decide on arm export it scrutinise the decision take that the input and expertise from the four select committees of this house on live issue and the geopolitical situation that need to be consider when scrutinise such decision be incredibly valuable ultimately however these thing be matter for the house it be now over two year since the hon member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch produce her fan lead review of football and the government have accept most of the recommendation in that time several community have face lose their local club and the long we wait the more that will happen when will we finally see the football governance bill or be we go to

odd pint together in strasbourg politic and parliament be the poor for his passing prevention and suppression of terrorism beg to move that the draft terrorism act proscribed organisations amendment order which be lay before this house on january be approve be grateful to the house for consider this draft order which will finally see hizb ut tahrir proscribe the event of october will be permanently ingrain on our mind what hamas do that day be barbaric it be evil who can erase the image that we see of mother cry over their blood soak bed with their child miss of teenager gun down at festival of peace or of woman abduct rap and slaughter who among we could fail to be appal by such depravity or to still feel the pain of those whose loved one be hostage who could stay silent in the face of the bad pogrom against jews on any day since the holocaust in the aftermath of october community across the united kingdom come together to condemn these vile act and to stand with british jews in their hour of grief not everyone however react with sorrow instead of horror hizb ut tahrir respond to the murder of civilian with elation instead of condemnation it lavish hamas with praise want to make something very clear be champion of freedom of speech and have no issue with people say thing that regard as insensitive uninformed or wrong but this be different free speech include neither the promotion of terrorism nor the celebration of terrorist act it be not acceptable to describe hamas as the hero of palestine or the event of october as long await victory it be not acceptable to refer to the killing of jewish tourist by an egyptian police officer as simple example of what should be do towards the jews it be not acceptable to call for so call muslim army to rise up and carry out similar act hizb ut tahrir have antisemitism at its very core it reject democracy and engage in vile homophobia as an organisation it do not just reject british value it seek to undermine they we will not let group such as hizb ut tahrir abuse our freedom we will never tolerate the promotion or encouragement of terrorism we have zero tolerance for antisemitism hizb ut tahrir must be proscribe before come to discuss the specific of the order will set out some background on the proscription power currently terrorist organisation be proscribe under the terrorism act for an organisation to be proscribe the government must believe that it be concern in terrorism as set out in section of the act if the statutory test be meet the home secretary must consider the proportionality of proscription and decide whether to exercise their discretion proscription be powerful tool with severe penalty criminalise membership and invitation of support for organisation it also support other disruptive activity include immigration disruption and terrorist financing order in short the resource of proscribe organisation be terrorist property and therefore liable to be seize decision to proscribe be take only after great care and consideration give its wide range impact it must be approve by both houses part of the act contain the proscription offence in section to an organisation be proscribe if it be list in schedule to the act article of the order will add hizb ut tahrir to the list in schedule as new entry we have carefully consider all the evidence hizb ut tahrir be concern in terrorism with the house consent it will be proscribe include all regional branch such as hizb ut tahrir britain although be unable to comment on specific intelligence can provide the house with summary of the group activity hizb ut tahrir be an international political organisation with footprint in at least country include the united kingdom the united states canada and australia its long term goal be to establish an expansionist caliphate rule under islamic law with no fixed border seek new territory to occupy in the name of jihad that be its stated aim hizb ut tahrir headquarters and central medium office be in beirut and its ideology and strategy be co ordinated centrally the british branch hizb ut tahrir britain be establish in it be afford autonomy to operate in its local environment but it be important to emphasise that it be part of coherent international movement and recognise the leadership of hizb ut tahrir the decision to proscribe therefore relate to hizb ut tahrir include all its regional branch any distinction between they be artificial there be evidence that hizb ut tahrir be concern in terrorism its central medium office and several of its middle eastern branch have celebrate and praise the barbaric terrorist attack on israel and other nation citizen carry out by hamas which as member will be aware be already proscribe organisation be the minister aware that zeyno baran of the hudson institute have observe that the british chapter of hizb ut tahrir be the nerve centre of the international movement as be so often the case when deal with terror organisation the responsibility to protect our own citizen extend to citizen in other country as well the right hon member be absolutely right that the unity of this organisation mean that one branch can not be separate from another the uk branch be important when take down the network around the world that be why as will come to this action be support not just here but around the world as mention early recent activity include an article attribute to hizb ut tahrir egyptian branch which refer to the killing of jewish tourist by an egyptian police officer as simple example of what should be do towards the jews the british branch be supportive of and indeed subservient to its global leadership and policy position it demonstrate hatred not just of israel but of all jews its promotion and encouragement of terrorism be inspire by an abhorrent antisemitic ideology hizb ut tahrir have frequently refer to hamas as the hero of palestine hamas be not hero those who perpetrate the attack on october be monster hizb ut tahrir britain publish an article on its website that describe the october attack as long await victory that ignite wave of joy and elation amongst muslims globally it be the government view that the content include in that article and other like it betray hizb ut tahrir and hizb ut tahrir britain true ideology and belief hizb ut tahrir have regularly engage in homophobic and antisemitic discourse it reject democracy and its aim bear similarity to those of terrorist group include daesh which be already proscribe internationally hizb ut tahrir play the mood music to which other terrorist dance this proscription will serve as reminder that the united kingdom do not and will never tolerate the promotion or encouragement of terrorism it will send the message that promote or encourage hamas sicken attack on october be utterly unacceptable and at odd with the value of this country by proscribe we will reassert our unwavering commitment to fight antisemitism which have increase unacceptably in the united kingdom and globally in recent month to the jewish community in the united kingdom say this we will always protect british citizen we will do whatever it take to protect you to british muslim parent and to many mosque across the country say this we will remove this menace that claim to act in your name hizb ut tahrir do not represent islam or muslims you be crucial part of our nation and your government be on your side before conclude will make couple of further point first the decision to proscribe be support by our international partner hizb ut tahrir be ban in many country around the world include in germany and restriction be place on its activity in austria this be an organisation that do not believe in border or the nation state and that call for the overthrow of every government in the islamic world it have declare the custodian of the two holy place in saudi arabia the khadim al haramayn an apostate and have be ban in turkey saudi arabia and the united arab emirates follow coup attempt in jordan and egypt it have be ban in those country as well its call for the caliphate be colonial imperialist ambition from another age and give legitimacy to other include isis and al qaeda when al nabhani split from the muslim brotherhood to found this organisation in it be to great extent because he do not believe in its incrementalist policy of use democracy but instead turn to violence and radicalise muslim military to establish single expansionist islamist empire this be an organisation call for the conquest of india greece spain and france anywhere in fact where muslim army once trod even if that be over year ago let we not forget the impact of hizb ut tahrir in the united kingdom one of its original leader subsequently go on to set up al muhajiroun pernicious organisation now also proscribe with link to many of the perpetrator of islamist inspire attack in recent year we be take this action to stop the pain and loss cause to countless family across our country who have lose love one to this cult this proscription be important to protect all community across our country and to stand with our ally and partner in nation from indonesia to morocco proscription be powerful tool it will significantly hamper hizb ut tahrir operation in the united kingdom and damage its activity and support for branch in other part of the world the united kingdom must not be hub for global terrorism not today not tomorrow not ever it will now be criminal offence for person to belong to hizb ut tahrir invite or express support for hizb ut tahrir arrange meeting in support of hizb ut tahrir and wear clothing carry or display article in public in such way as to arouse reasonable suspicion that the individual be member of or supporter of hizb ut tahrir the penalty for conviction of proscription offence can be maximum of year in prison an unlimited fine the first duty of government be to keep our people safe to guard the home of our friend and fellow citizen and to discourage any from go down the path of radicalisation that destroy life nothing matter more it be tremendous responsibility and one that we approach with the utmost seriousness the fight against terrorism demand constant vigilance when there be clear need for action to support that vital mission we will not hesitate therefore urge the house to support this proscription order it be proportionate response to the promotion and encouragement of terrorism it be justified response to call for violence and disorder and it be necessary to defend our value and to protect all the community of our great country thank the security minister for what he have say and his colleague at the home office for brief the shadow home secretary and ahead of this debate today proscription order be underpin by the exceptional man and woman who serve in our intelligence and security service in government and in our police they work tirelessly to keep our country safe we be extremely fortunate to have they keep our country safe be the first duty of government and common cause that we share and treat with the utmost seriousness on that basis it be vital that the government and the opposition work together in the national interest on these crucial issue as the minister lay out the order will amend schedule of the terrorism act to add hizb ut tahrir to the list of proscribe organisation do so will make it criminal offence to belong to hizb ut tahrir to engage in activity such as attend meeting to promote support for the group or to display its logo after year of serious and increase concern about hizb ut tahrir activity both internationally and in the uk the opposition strongly support its proscription it be necessary and proportionate step to effectively counter its hateful extremism and divisive rhetoric which threaten the safety and security of our country proscription of this international terrorist organisation come after other country include germany have already ban it hizb ut tahrir be be proscribe now because of escalate activity in the aftermath of hamas barbaric terrorist attack on israel unlike other muslim group in the uk who condemn these attack hizb ut tahrir britain glorify as hero the hamas terrorist who revel in act of indiscriminate violence against civilian in the aftermath of october there be deep sorrow and outrage among the british people share with the israeli people but hizb ut tahrir boast of its euphoria on the news of that appalling and tragic loss of life there be no place on britain street for vile antisemitism there be no place on britain street for those who incite violence and glorify terrorism there be no place on britain street for hizb ut tahrir this terrorist group peddle hate glorifie violence and be not only hostile to our value but hostile to the common tenet of humanity there be nothing new about the divisive and poisonous rhetoric of hizb ut tahrir which have be widely record for over two decade in the uk long before the attack of october organisation such as the community security trust the antisemitism policy trust and the union of jewish student have long raise serious concern about hizb ut tahrir antisemitism alongside its misogynistic and homophobic hate speech which provide channel for extremism that be why previous prime ministers home secretaries and security ministers have consider proscribe hizb ut tahrir but its activity be not recognise as sufficient under the definition of terrorism in section of the terrorism act until now give the amount of time for which these matter have be debate and consider should be grateful if the minister when he respond say whether he think there be lesson to be learn about the length of time that it have take to proscribe hizb ut tahrir will he also say whether he believe that the current proscription process be agile enough to counter threat to our national security robustly and whether he agree that bespoke proscription mechanism for state sponsor organisation which labour have already call for be now require counter threat to our national security require join up cross government work but the counter extremism strategy have not be update since with important element of policy involve community cohesion now the responsibility of the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities give the significance of these matter should be grateful if the minister tell the house when the government will provide new definition of hateful extremism can he also tell we when his department will update the extremism strategy an update that have be call for by the shadow home secretary my right hon friend the member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper proscribing hizb ut tahrir be the right thing to do for our national security for too long the public have be expose to its extremist ideology its glorification of terrorist activity and its core aim of overthrow our democratic system of government to replace it with an islamist theocracy if leave alone extremism can and will spread insidiously and seep deeply into our national conversation no government must ever relent in their determination to ensure that we be always one step ahead of those who seek to harm we or to undermine our way of life this house must always be on the side of the public whom we strive to serve and protect and that be why we strongly support this proscription order rise order note that there be some interest in this debate it must end by pm so ask members to be mindful of the contribution that they make as speak in this debate will have in mind the hostage who be still hold by hamas include eli sharabi several colleague and meet his brother in law steve in the house yesterday welcome what both the minister and the shadow minister say on this subject and disagree with nothing thank the organisation that have campaign on this issue over the year include the ujs and the antisemitism policy trust which be ably lead by danny stone he have long campaign on this and congratulate they all on their effort which have now pay off my only slight point of disagreement with what have be say be that once again voice my support for the proscription of the islamic revolutionary guard corps which be behind hezbollah hamas and of course the houthis this be debate of consensus so will leave that for another day as the minister say hizb ut tahrir be an antisemitic racist organisation that promote and encourage terrorism as both front benchers say it openly celebrate the appalling pogrom of october and have describe hamas as hero they be not hero they be murderer and rapist for which they should be call out by everyone hizb ut tahrir be an explicitly antisemitic group and have target gay people woman and muslims who do not share its perverse interpretation of islam it be right to ban this group but will that ban include its pernicious online activity will now look at some of the individual involve with hizb ut tahrir omar khan sharif one of the british bomber of mike place in tel aviv be find with hizb ut tahrir literature the bombing take place in the second intifada so let we remember what an intifada be for those who have be march in the street with sign call for an intifada at the weekend people hold sign call for socialist intifada be not sure what socialist intifada be perhaps it mean murder people more fairly but that be what people have be call for the second intifada involve the bombing of pub and civilian bus and it involve the murder of countless innocent civilian that be what people have be call for on our street and they have be allow to continue call for it without any police action it get even bad because this weekend we hear people not only on the march but on the stage say that massacre should now become the norm there be no place for that in society which be why such motion should be welcome not only by every member but by everyone in this country could not agree more doubtless the majority of people who attend protest be peaceful but that behaviour be make jewish people in this country frighten of wherever the protest take place the jewish community in my region have express to its concern about the small march we have have in my area and of course jews in london be afraid to come into central london when the march be take place precisely because of that behaviour which believe be by minority the leader of hizb ut tahrir in denmark be convict of racial hatred for distribute leaflet that say kill they kill the jews wherever you find they the organisation tell its follower that they should not be close friend with non muslims in fact one of its leaflet say we maintain that the clash of civilisation be not only inevitable but imperative of course it share that view with neo nazis it be absolutely right to ban this organisation and agree with everything that the minister and the shadow minister say welcome though it be however the ban will not end the continue target of the jewish community and jewish people in this country which have lead to increase in antisemitism this week be inform by the police force in my area that pro palestinian activist might come to protest one of our holocaust memorial day event be sure they will protest peacefully but that event be be target for no other reason than jews will be present that be absolutely appalling and disgraceful behaviour just as it would be for person to protest hamas or hizb ut tahrir at muslim community event it be completely unacceptable in fact it be pervert jewish charity that support disaffect young man and young boy in the north of london be target this week by activist who scream and shout abuse outside what do jewish charity work with disaffect youth have to do with this conflict it be target for no other reason than it involve jews we have see continued denial of the event of october in online space and on the street of this country although this proscription will do great deal it will not prevent the continue target of jews indeed in just the last few day because of smear someone post online after dare to say in this place that people who do not contextualise the israeli response to october with the event of october be give the terrorist free pass have receive the most appalling antisemitic communication include describe the hostage as they zionist rat hostage someone message to say nobody care about the jews another message to tell that should be flog because of my belief have be target with email directly quote the comment make about on social medium and tell that they be false flag operation that the hostage do not exist and that it be the israelis who kill people on october all the various conspiracy theory the comment on social medium have enable antisemitism of the most awful kind and be afraid it will continue which be why we have to do so much more know that both the government and the opposition have do incredible thing in call all of this out and put extra money into the cst but the continue target of jews in this country be deeply disturbing although this motion be welcome it will not prevent that from continue we need tough action as say in westminster hall debate it have seem on occasion as if the metropolitan police force be act as the public relation arm of some of the protest instead of do what it should be do and protect british jews from such hate speech we be such small community just of the population thank the minister and the shadow minister for what they have say and welcome this move hope the minister will answer my question on whether the order will apply to hizb ut tahrir online activity the snp absolutely support the proscription of hizb ut tahrir we stand with jews and jewish community against antisemitism particularly thank the union of jewish students for its work in aberdeen and be grateful for the comment it have bring to about its experience in the wake of october the hon member for brigg and goole andrew percy tell we about some of the incredibly explicit and horrific comment he have receive and feel for all those who receive such comment whether or not they be in the public light receive such comment be awful and we be happy to commit to work with everyone in the house to do everything we can to oppose antisemitism wherever it occur in our community we must stamp out antisemitism wherever we can we recognise the horrifying dangerous comment and attitude of hizb ut tahrir and agree with the reason the minister set out for its proscription at time of unprecedented violence on so many front we call for and we support those who call for unity in the face of the force of hatred that try to divide we can the minister assure we that after proscription he and the government will take further action to remove hizb ut tahrir ability to operate in the uk and together with international partner its ability to operate around the world where we can do so will he update the house on the government action and its impact afterwards if necessary understand the need for some of that action to be take without give head up but we would like to see the outcome and whether it have have an effect so that we can support future action and be clear that it will achieve what the government intend wholeheartedly agree with the comment make by the hon member for brigg and goole about the antisemitism policy trust and danny stone danny be an absolutely dedicated public servant who do huge amount of good in support his community and bring advice and information to parliamentarian ensure that we be all far more knowledgeable as result will the minister update the house on whether the government have make further assessment of whether to proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps it continue to be the snp position that sanction be not enough and that proscription of this organisation be require if he can assure we that this be be keep under watch brief that would give we at least some reassurance that the government have not entirely rule it out and that it could be consider in the future we ask that that organisation be proscribe too thank the minister for introduce this order and agree with the timescale it be relatively unusual to have legislation come forward this quickly but in this case we be happy to support it because of the speed and haste with which this have to be do in order to ensure that hizb ut tahrir can be proscribe we support the uk government proscription of the organisation we hope that the action take by the minister his government and everyone mention by those on the shadow front bench include the security staff and the police will ensure that such organisation can not continue to operate we support the work that they be do and we hope that it pay off we hope that we have positive result as result of the action that the government the security service and the police be take as say we be happy to support the proscription in this case rise to support the government the proscription of hizb ut tahrir be overdue but it be always good when it happen continue to welcome my right hon friend the minister to his position both of we of course have be sanction by the chinese government and may touch on this in second the proscription of hizb ut tahrir be overdue because it have be well know for quite some time here that the uk have be at the centre of operation be always concerned about how long it sometimes take we in the uk to openly recognise that there be force at work within this united kingdom use our freedom and our judicial system to protect themselves while they promote the most ghastly behaviour and attitude after all hizb ut tahrir be an antisemitic organisation as my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy and my right hon friend the minister have already make clear antisemitism be at the core of its whole being it be not an organisation that be passingly antisemitic antisemitism be its core belief let we be clear that the killing of jews be priority for hizb ut tahrir and its activity here in the uk as result of the protection it be no long to have have influence lot of people who do not really understand what be go on in the middle east and who settle on the idea that hizb ut tahrir be somehow espouse the view of people who be persecute abroad it be not hizb ut tahrir be talk about the persecution and eventual eradication of the jewish people hizb ut tahrir be antisemitic and racist as my hon friend say it have also support other group in their attack on israel as have be say already hizb ut tahrir celebrate the october murder and the taking of hostage and it have encourage terrorism globally but it have also provide excuse for some of the nonsense be say at the moment on some of the march people do not seem to understand what the organisation be say support my hon friend call to make sure that its online activity be seek out and shut down and that those involve in they be prosecute under the criminal code that be critical so welcome my government decision to proscribe hizb ut tahrir it be worth bear in mind want to come back to this in second that as my hon friend say early there be terrorist organisation proscribe here in the uk and this will now add to that want to come to the other bit here which be to do with the irgc will not spend too long on this but want to make this point because these organisation be link we be proscribe an organisation that be dangerous vile antisemitic and abusive but there be another organisation whose finger extend into all these organisation around the world and here in the uk the irgc it make possible much of what go on in term of the attitude towards antisemitism the attack on people in democracy and the misogyny and homophobia within these organisation it be not just one element it be complete we know now that since the attack in october iran have accelerate its execution of those who have protest against the current regime an astonishing number of execution be now take place under cover of what be go on in gaza it be quite appalling we know that the irgc be behind hezbollah it direct it arm and it make sure that hezbollah act as its arm in lebanon and beyond it be attack israel right now to keep israeli force tie up in northern israel for tactical reason the second part be that we be now engage in try to protect our shipping in the red sea who be supply the houthi rebel the terrorist with arm and direction it be iran which have up its supply of rocket to the houthis when the foreign secretary say to iran that it have some responsibility for this as think he do quite recently iran response be mind your own business and leave that alone it be still supply the houthis with weapon and if we do not get our action right they could shut down the red sea for all trade when be approach by somebody who have be protest ask be you aware of what be go on here they say what do it matter these people in israel be persecute the palestinians in gaza so they right to do this reply so you do mind massive inflation hike and huge extra cost you do mind the fact that trade can not travel down the short route and all the other consideration they just look at blankly because they have not understand what we be talk about right now iran be directly involve in what be go on in the red sea to try to shut down the free world business arrangement and affect the cost of good another part of it be that iran be quite clearly involve in the attack that take place in october on peaceful israeli citizen and other the murder and the hostage taking how do it benefit from this iran know that israel would have to respond that be exactly what the whole plan be to launch vile attack murder enough jews and make sure that israeli territory be invade so that israel be bind to attack be not go to spend time debate exactly how far israel should have go or any of that which be separate issue my personal view be very clear iran be link to russia and what be go on take the attention off russia and divide america ability to supply arm and weaponry it create major debate which be go on in the united states at the moment about give supply to the ukrainians to defend themselves and it also take the attention away from china aggression towards taiwan iran be part of the axis of authoritarianism which also include china north korea russia and now syria and other in the middle east iran be very dangerous and the irgc be the arm of the iranian government not only be iran behind all the attack but it continue to persecute christians to degree that we simply can not understand execution incarceration and abuse be take place as we hear yesterday in report deliver here in the house of commons what do the government plan to do about the irgc america have ask the british government to proscribe it and we simply have not yet respond ask nameless individual who be involve with this and with the government why they have not proscribe the irgc they say it keep back channel for we to get america through to iran say what we now have to act as back channel for the americans do we think the american government be quite capable of find way to engage iran if they have to they then say well of course we would lose our ability to influence iran ask they exactly what influence have we have over iran in the last five year they say the release of hostage say no you do you pay for those big time and they be hostage taking for that we have no influence over iran iran be dangerous and the irgc be the arm of that threat around the world with two iranian bank sit in the city of london we know how the money be transfer to support some of these organisation create some of the nonsense on the march most people do not understand what from the river to the sea mean notwithstanding the fact that hassan nasrallah make it very clear that the chant mean clear the jews out of palestine and israel be go it be as simple as that he say that that be what it mean yet people chant it and the metropolitan police still do not seem to understand that it be an aggressive antisemitic chant have jewish sister in law who tell the other day that she have never feel more under threat and less safe in this country in her whole life what statement to make in this united kingdom which uphold freedom of speech and the rule of law that jewish person now feel desperately under threat just get up and go to work in the morning that be simply not right and we need to deal with it who be behind all this the irgc in his concluding remark will the minister please address this issue it be more than high time this be cross party issue know that those on the opposition front bench have call for it we have to face this the irgc must now be proscribe and the bank of iran shut down in the uk the irgc can no long continue to use the uk as base for further operation congratulate the government on their decision on hizb ut tahrir but we should go lot far we need to protect our citizen congratulate the government will not say that too many time on take the important and welcome step of ban the extremist antisemitic misogynistic and homophobic group that be hizb ut tahrir echo the comment of the hon member for brigg and goole andrew percy about the hostage still in gaza one message that we can all get behind be to bring they home now this group pose threat not only to democratic institution but to people include the vast majority of the muslim community here at home hizb ut tahrir or hut as will refer to it have blight our shore and specifically our university campus for year it have run meeting and distribute leaflet include one that describe jews as coward and call on muslims to purify yourself against the deception of the jews on the israel palestine conflict it have call for the elimination of the monstrous jewish entity restore all of palestine to the land of islam if that be not an organisation preach hatred do not know what be anti racism campaigner include the union of jewish student have be particularly alive to the threat and its officer have run campaign over many year include successfully to have the group outlaw by the national union of students as early as despite that uk hut activist have seek to circumvent such effort report have emerge that between and keynote speaker from hut speak to separate campus over month include in bradford and birmingham and at the london school of economics the speaker include luqman muqeem prominent figure on the hut website who speak five time at the university of birmingham despite have post video online in which he say that muslims must fight jews to the death and voice support for the attack on sir salman rushdie hut have long history of use front group on campus for example radical from the group have seek to pass themselves off as the one nation society the democracy society the islamic front the muslim media forum the muslim current affairs society the new world society and the society in change the legislation will the government also look at those organisation to ensure that hut can find no further loophole to preach its hatred on university campus such group be observe at university across the country include in nottingham at queen mary and locally to in manchester concern have be raise about how the group might have continue to undermine our legal and official system use those front group the antisemitism policy trust danny stone who have rightly be mention several time in the debate highlight to the public bill committee for the higher education freedom of speech act the danger of hut in its many guise misuse the new free speech protection in order to solicit compensation it be therefore extremely welcome news that that potential loophole be now firmly closed but ask the minister to confirm that front group alias and other mask will not be enough to prevent hut member from be identify and prosecute this move will be welcome not only by numerous other individual such as sir anthony glees and group such as the cst and hope not hate have call for hut to be proscribe although welcome today move we need as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith say to go far and proscribe the one group that be not only provide funding but destabilising entire region the irgc that be more important now than ever consider the last day or so both group be antisemitic they blatantly repeat those trope time and again have mention that in this chamber on the street in westminster hall and online and will continue to do so because we need to highlight what an evil organisation the irgc be both organisation perpetuate homophobia suggest that both labour and the conservatives should not be trust because of our work to protect lgbt community again that be not welcome in modern tolerant society the irgc rail against what it define as the secular democratic liberal system and in favour of global caliphate these be freedom and right that we have work hard to earn and we will protect they with every ounce of our being because that be the right thing to do worldwide hut have reportedly be behind attempt coup in jordan syria and egypt again with the backing of the irgc the irgc be also in yemen back the houthis in lebanon with hezbollah and in gaza with hamas those activity be not limit to foreign country we see they on the street in this country which be why we really need to tackle the threat of the irgc seriously when we see hamas operative here in the capital that be step too far this move from the government be important and correct it be slightly overdue but it be welcome thank the minister for come to the house to highlight it but we need to go far place on the record my support and that of my party for today measure the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith give lot of important international context particularly in relation to recent event in the red sea and in yemen will spare the house repetition of what he say simply place on the record the fact that very much endorse his analysis of what be go on there not least because it bring into sharp relief the role of the irgc as other have say it seem as if the focus of our attention must now turn in the direction of the irgc if it be any consolation to the minister think it have emerge from today debate that consensus to proscribe the irgc would be easily construct whether to proscribe hizb ut tahrir be not new debate it have be go on for considerable time think it be back in that david anderson the government reviewer of terror legislation advise against proscription on the basis that the group be not advocate violence clearly we be in different situation today but mention that because feel slightly conflict about the speed with which we have move we should be slow to ban any organisation because as society it be not something we should do lightly however once the evidence be there as it clearly have be for some time and as it have be in relation to the irgc then as the hon member for barnsley central dan jarvis say that raise question about whether our process for make such decision be adequate obviously it be important to take this step as part of our domestic legislation at the moment because not to do so would send the bad possible signal to those in the jewish community who have feel so embattle since the event of october hope they will take some comfort from the fact that action of this sort have be take against those who have preach and do more than preach antisemitism however there be wide legislative context as important as it be to proscribe organisation like hizb ut tahrir that be only part of big plan it seem that many of the other tool in that fight such as the prevent strategy be not achieve the goal we need they to achieve they be overdue for proper root and branch review let we not forget that spiral emerge here we see the growth in antisemitism and antisemitic hate crime but that in turn produce growth in islamophobia so we do not proscribe hizb ut tahrir in the interest only of jewish community but in the interest of muslim community as well the tackling of extremism of which that be just part have to be at the heart of find long term and sustainable way of approach the issue encourage the minister to speak again to his colleague in the home office in particular about the prevent strategy we know what we want it to achieve but as we view it today have serious concern about its ability to deliver what we need it to do truly the world be become hostile place the more we watch what happen across the world the more we be convince of the evil intent of many thank the minister for his statement clarity and strength of intention know that my party will fully support he as we always do when it come to these matter the reason for the proscription have be clearly outline by other it be important that we do something in relation to the hamas murder of innocent israelis the taking of hostage the continue war of aggression and their view about the annihilation of the israelis in the uk we want to play our part the minister have outline how we can take on the terrorist activity and intention of those who march in the street and think they have status above the law of the land today quite clearly they do not and we welcome that the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith always speak with much wisdom and bring forward issue that we all endorse in their entirety the proscription of the irgc be critical because it fund train and give weapon to many terrorist organisation across the world we need to take that proscription stage far on top of this one and do that with zest be ever mindful that organisation have be proscribe already as northern ireland mp be obviously aware of the issue as be the right hon and gallant member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat from his personal point of view have serve in the army and now as the minister for security the real ira and the new ira have be most active and the threat level in northern ireland be at height we have not see for some time there have be number of demonstration across northern ireland and we be ever mindful of international terrorism as those who want to murder destabilise kill maim and destroy come together wherever they may be from be conscious that it be not always appropriate for the minister to answer certain question in the chamber but want to put on the record my concern about the connection between ira republicanism and international terrorism during the demonstration that have take place across northern ireland thing be say and do that should never have be do in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland where be great believer in unity and be well together on commitment by police force have the minister have the opportunity to speak to the force here on the mainland and to the police service of northern ireland to ensure that they collectively take on hizb ut tahrir the terrorist organisation proscribe today be sure he have but it would be nice to have that on the record it be important that we be unified on the issue as we be in the chamber especially when it come to intelligence gathering and work collectively police force need to be able to exchange their point of view and the intelligence that they gather to ensure that they protect our citizen across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland which we all have duty to do the proscription today be step in the right direction but hope the minister can provide some reassurance on my final point pay tribute to member for the tone in which the debate have be conduct place on record my thank to the hon member for barnsley central dan jarvis it be pleasure to stand with he again in protect our country interest this time little close to home also pay tribute to the hon member for halifax holly lynch who be with he on the opposition front bench early she be an extremely able predecessor in his role and great help repeat the hon gentleman thank to the intelligence service who have do so much to prepare the evidence in various different way which have enable we to support these various action although much of the information have be public so it have be able to prepare it in the usual way thank he for his comment about the way in which this work have be do as he recognise it have be little quick than we would normally go but be grateful that the scottish national party and the labour party recognise that there be an urgency to this matter and have support it will briefly answer the hon gentleman question about the timing of the proscription this be quite rightly detailed legal work the judgment have to be make extremely carefully it must be not only lawful but proportionate and we must get that balance right as other have mention proscription be an extremely powerful tool it be not political tool or to be use at the whim of government or minister to silence critic or debate this tool should be use only to protect the british people from terrorism that be its purpose we need to make absolutely clear that we be use it appropriately and only when necessary all of we in this house hope support freedom of view and freedom of expression we have all hear thing we may not like but we would defend the right of people to say they and we must ensure we be extremely careful about that the hon gentleman raise question about the definition of extremism as he know we be work on that pay huge tribute to those work on that and to the government counter extremism adviser robin simcox who have be an extremely important voice in much of the debate thank member on the opposition front bench for their support turn to my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy who have be good friend of mine but more importantly good friend to his community for very long time he be tireless in the campaign against antisemitism he rightly identify what we be see today as be in the mould of the fascist movement of the we could easily mistake some of the word on the work of hizb ut tahrir as come from the voice of some of the fascist leader of the they bear stark resemblance to they he be absolutely right that the online activity must be ban and he will be pleased to hear that they be all activity by this group be ban my hon friend be also right to say that jews should not be afraid to be in london at any time and certainly not on saturday or sunday when many people want to go out shopping or just to be with friend and family these protest sadly have not only be vile demonstration of some of the bad part of our community but radicalise moment in themselves know the police be aware of that the home secretary and have both speak to they about that thank the right hon and gallant member for give way he join on the march against antisemitism several week ago when ten of thousand of people be say no to jew hatred may use this moment to say that there be similar march in manchester this weekend if any member want to join we to say no to antisemitism they would be more than welcome the hon gentleman will see again on sunday as will be there with he may suggest to my right hon friend that his department look into the possibility of confine march to static location the fact be that all people be currently be inhibit from attend central london at weekend and that be have significant impact on commerce and shop in the west end would not want to see demonstration inhibit by have cost impose on they but it seem perfectly reasonable compromise after so many march to have static location thank my right hon friend for his suggestion shall certainly take that away and be sure that my colleague in the department will come back to he may just turn to the remark of the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman she rightly praise the union of jewish students in aberdeen and the work that it have do the union have do some incredibly important work around the united kingdom in our university which have see rise in antisemitism on their campus have already speak to universities uk and the russell group about that we simply can not tolerate this it be simply unacceptable to see student exclude from education because of the vile hatred of other it be wrong it be unbritish and it will not be tolerate the hon lady will understand hope that she forgive why for very obvious reason will not go into the action that the police and other organisation may be take but she can be assure that conversation have be have that will lead to action as soon as possible to ensure that this proscription once authorise by both houses will not be sit idly on the book and will be enforce as she would rightly expect just before the minister finish on that point will he commit to update we even if it be some time down the line about the impact that those action have have to assure we that they have work absolutely will do that hope the house forgive if sound slightly coy in the way that put this but will update the hon lady as soon as can in the most appropriate way possible now turn to the comment of my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith who note that we be both sanction by the chinese state can add both the iranian and russian government and after today think he will be join in at least one of those what we be see be pattern of violence as he rightly identify it have spread out of tehran over many decade and have have an influence on many different group include as he correctly identify in the red sea in this late episode of houthi piracy we be incredibly aware of that which be why the government have rightly take action the prime minister be absolutely clear immediately that we should stand not just with our american ally but with many other around the world in make sure that we defend freedom of navigation and that we protect those people work on ship who be from very diverse background and have be target by this violence in recent month sadly we have see the murder of crew and ship worker by houthi rebel in the red sea and it be right that we take action be grateful to the prime minister for his clear and determined response my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green also raise the question of deal with state actor in this matter this be something that he and have discuss in the past draw the house attention to the recent introduction of the national security act which give extraordinary and extra power to our intelligence and police service to make sure that they may take action not just against intelligence service but against any who be support they and work with they it be not admit the same as proscription but it do give huge range of authority to our community to make sure that it be properly defend against the threat that we see it would be wrong of to comment far on proscription option that we may be hold in reserve as member will know for very clear reason these be matter that we do not discuss until we be ready to announce they none the less it be absolutely right to say that we be take the state abuse of our citizen or the intervention of state in our government or economic process extremely seriously that sit alongside the national security and investment act and hopefully demonstrate clearly to the whole house that we will not tolerate foreign interference or foreign aggression on our soil or illegitimate us by foreign intelligence service of organisation within the united kingdom that be design to do we harm the hon member for bury south who will be see on sunday also speak about front group and he be absolutely right to do so if there be alias or name change provision can be change quickly that be cover under the terrorism act should it be necessary we will update the house but member can be assure that simply change name do not avoid proscription the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael speak about advocate violence and the challenge of radicalisation in what we be see draw the house attention to the fact that the independent reviewer of prevent sir william shawcross have just publish his report he have do what think be magisterial piece of work which highlight area where we need to update and change policy we have accept his recommendation and be in the process of make sure that the prevent duty as it apply to this country be there to help and protect family across this country not just from the effect of violence but from the effect of radicalisation the pain that many family must feel when their child be tear away into these cult like organisation be horrific and it be quite right that we protect family from every community across this country that be where the hon member for strangford jim shannon be right as well of course this action apply across the whole of the united kingdom and of course we will be have conversation with police force across the whole of the united kingdom regularly communicate with the psni which be very important part of our national police presence and very effective police force be grateful to the hon member for his comment and support this action be about protect the whole of the united kingdom against terror sadly his part of the united kingdom have experience far too much of that although remember very clearly as child here in london the effect of northern irish terror be feel on the underground and on the bus where sadly too many people be also kill and maim on that thank the house for this debate hope that this motion will go through as intend to ensure that this country be well protect question put and agree to resolve that the draft terrorism act proscribed organisations amendment order which be lay before this house on january be approve backbench business loan charge beg to move that this house be deeply concerned that hmrc have confirm the suicide of people face the loan charge and that despite the morse review thousand face unaffordable demand with the risk of further suicide note that hmrc have also confirm case of serious harm include suicide attempt believe that many people who use scheme be victim of mis selling and that in other case employer and agency push people into use they yet hmrc be demand all dispute tax from scheme user not from those who recommend promote and operate the scheme further note that section of the income tax earnings and pensions act deem agency worker to be taxable as employee of those agency and that hmrc should have collect tax from agency at the time criticise hmrc transfer the liability to individual despite its own failure observe that hmrc be pursue open enquiry for scheme before despite the morse review also note that hmrc be seek additional payment from those who settle far believe that the morse review be limited and not genuinely independent of hm treasury and hmrc highlight the resolution propose by tax professional call on the government to work with all party to find fair resolution and for full independent investigation include into the conduct of hmrc and believe that taxpayer right must be enshrine in law and enquiry close after four year if hmrc fail to act before we start the debate on behalf of my party pass on our condolence to the family of tony lloyd he serve for short time as the shadow minister for northern ireland always find he to be very courteous and well inform and he want to be well informed he ask the right question and be always prepared to engage even though he often do not agree with some of the stand we take he be always happy to engage with all the party in northern ireland and we pass on our condolence to his family order be slightly concerned that there be something wrong with the sound let we start again thank you madam deputy speaker hope that the point be make about tony lloyd be pick up want to pass on the condolence of our party to his family and pay tribute to the work he do as shadow minister for northern ireland thank the backbench business committee for grant the debate it be timely debate and know that the many thousand of people across the united kingdom who have be affect by the loan charge in very detrimental way will be glad that it be be consider in this house over the past two week we have be look at the dramatic fallout of the horizon scandal at the post office and quite rightly we have be focus on what belatedly can be do to repay and to deal with that great injustice say to the house do not think that be be overdramatic when say this that we be look at another horizon scandal and the parallel be frightening first because of the action of government department people in the united kingdom have commit suicide and many other have attempt to take their own life because of the pressure they be put under by official and by statute pass by this parliament we have hear time and again in evidence to the loan charge and taxpayer fairness all party parliamentary group of the disruption and disaster this have cause in many family secondly despite the fact that alarm bell should be ring in the treasury no action have be take indeed some ministers have even refuse to meet the group other have simply put out the party line and regurgitate the excuse of his majesty revenue and customs for what be happen do the right hon gentleman agree that it seem to be the case yet again that people act in good faith be be prosecute and pursue whereas the people who absolutely know what they be do be get away scot free that be point want to come to we be see that once again minister be turn blind eye and these lesson should be learn apart from two example of ministers that can think of one of whom former minister be present ministers turn blind eye for year we then have the result but it be not until an itv programme bring this matter to the nation as whole that action be take we have have attempt by hmrc to justify what it have be do in the past postmaster and postmistress who have unblemished record for year be accuse of be thief we be now be tell that the people who hmrc be chase today be to use its tax evader minister have to say that when read the letter that you order the right hon gentleman know that he do not address the minister directly but through the chair when read the letter that the minister send to the joint chair of the all party group he start by once again remind we that as you be aware disguised remuneration scheme be contrive tax avoidance arrangement that seek to avoid income tax and national insurance contribution it be almost like warning do be take up these case because these be bad people that you be talk about that be exactly parallel to what we find with the horizon scandal agree with how the right hon gentleman have introduce the debate he mention the scale of how hmrc be go after people catch up with the loan charge be that not in stark contrast with how multinational company be enter into sweetheart deal with hmrc such as google and vodafone indeed it be and will come to the issue of hmrc chase the individual rather than the promoter will the right hon member give way let just make this point it seem that hmrc be go after those whom it regard as easy target the promoter of the scheme have not pay one penny despite the fact that they have make hundred of million of pound from the scheme have mis sell they and have disappear when there be any attempt to get at they the promoter be not be pursue and indeed hmrc have admit that it do not intend to chase after the promoter and yet individual be be harass to the point where many of they have take their own life congratulate the right hon member on have secure today debate especially give that at least people have sadly commit suicide it be of course essential that disguised remuneration scheme be deal with fairly and effectively but why do he think the government and hmrc have not actively pursue the architect and promoter of the scheme rather than the victim who have be lead into the scheme the answer be easy the victim be easy target they be the one who be easy to chase the promoter of the scheme have all kind of mean of defence many disappear when they realise that they may well be pursue this be the baffle thing and maybe the minister can explain it if these scheme be design as contrive way of avoid tax why be hmrc not pursue even some of the new promoter who be establish themselves today and who will have disappear by tomorrow once it be see that their scheme be be challenge be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his courtesy on this occasion share his comment about sir tony lloyd who be member of the northern ireland affairs committee which chair the right hon gentleman make an important point about the regulation of promoter where be the regulation of those individual this be an ungoverned space surely as they be try to sell financial service product they should at least come under the control of the financial conduct authority we have to not just focus on what have happen in the past but look at what be happen now where innocent people be be exploit intend to come on to that point the parallel as say be frightening ask myself this question and the minister should be ask it of himself too in one two four five or year time will we see the same embarrassment and see ministers who parrot the department line be ask the question why do you not raise the alarm at the time why be the explanation not challenge and why be the call for help not heed that should be salutary warning to ministers it be very unusual that agree with every word the right hon gentleman be be generous the simple truth be that hmrc fail to police this issue many people make hmrc aware of their involvement in the scheme and it take hmrc year to get back to they or even to look into the issue that be one of the real crime here be glad the hon gentleman agree with everything have say today think he have even dress to show that agreement with his red white and blue outfit and appreciate that very much maybe he have become unionist as well even for day that would be something of miracle let we look at the role of hmrc and the approach it have take it have be rightly point out that there should have be much more supervision within hmrc of what be go on hmrc be now say that it believe that many of the people who use payroll loan scheme should have be pay pay as you earn but at the time hmrc be not challenge the scheme and the promoter be able to say they be legitimate for year people be act in the belief that they be legitimate and be no risk and here be the ultimate irony hmrc employ people on contract to do work for it know that those people be be pay in that way and never challenge it that be the case we have to ask what the level of supervision be or whether hmrc change its mind and then have do so decide to go after the individual who have undertake those scheme some people will argue well it their own fault after all they know that when they go into one of these scheme their tax liability may have be reduce if people do that they take that risk the fact be that many people do not volunteer to go into those scheme many people be force into they some people be put into those scheme and do not even know they be in they as far as they be concern they be employ by contractor and their tax be be deduct and they only find out later on that that be not the case by the way this be not rich people employ fancy accountant to tell they how to avoid their tax many of the people catch up in the scheme be ordinary worker nurse teacher cleaner and some be people who want to set up company and because of the flaw in this be the only way of deal with their tax affair people do not always volunteer to go into the scheme one of the way we discover that hmrc be involve in this be that one lady come to we and say be employ by an it consultancy the contractor be work for hmrc and the only way could get the job be to be pay through one of these scheme do not particularly want to but want the work so have to enter into the scheme hmrc apparently be quite happy for that contractor to pay its worker in that manner in many case if people want to work they be force into these kind of scheme for year although it be quite clear that there be an employer employee relationship and they be under the direction and supervision of company they be treat as if they be separate stand alone employee or individual self employ people who could pay tax in that way the result be of course that when it be decide that the scheme be not tax compliant and there be year and year of back tax ministers be persuade to introduce the loan charge in the finance act it be very convenient for hmrc to have that arrangement in place because use the loan charge enable it to decide what tax an individual be liable for and people could not challenge it in the normal way tax dispute can be deal with through either tribunal or court that be rule out for they in many instance hmrc do not even have to explain how the tax bill be reach if people do not have any redress to court or tribunal they really have no chance of negotiate whether or not the tax they have be deem liable for be liability and correct liability add to that be the fact that many employer see the scheme as an advantage because they could employ people without pay employment taxis or have to deal with pension or holiday pay that be why many employer force individual to be pay in that way those who argue look these people try to avoid pay tax so slap it up they now they have reap the consequence and they should just grin and bear it should bear in mind that thousand of people be affect by this because they be impotent to stop that method of payment be use and be tell by the promoter that it be all compliant and that there be no risk in fact of those in the scheme be assure there be no risk and that they be compliant indeed they probably be compliant until in later year hmrc decide they be not compliant people be leave with tax investigation go back to which have result in many of they find it impossible to pay want to mention couple of case study because the confusion in hmrc make it very difficult for people to settle hmrc do not seem to have the capacity to tell people in one particular case an individual be tell after six year you owe he want to settle rather than be put in the loan charge he be tell despite the fact that that be not in the criterion we do believe you can afford to pay on the term you have give so no settlement be grant and he be put in the loan charge and the man who could not afford to pay be then hit with bill of he could not afford to pay in settlement but he be push into loan charge where he have to pay we have the back charge tax year that people think be close have be reopen the confusion and some people now have to pay more in tax than they actually earn hmrc do estimate think one person be tell when an explanation be seek of why they owe so much that it be because everybody else pay that amount and of course there be no redress congratulate the right hon gentleman on bring such an important debate to the chamber have be contact by several constituent who have describe themselves as victim of this situation do he agree that those people who be be ask to pay what my constituent describe as incomprehensible amount of money while their employer and the people who provide those scheme be not be pursue for one penny be victim but be assume to be criminal do he agree that they must be treat as victim and that this must be cover by truly independent inquiry that bring to the very last point promise it be my last madam deputy speaker will simply list the point and other people can take they up and expand they later on there be number of issue the minister must consider first while have no evidence of this we have be tell that hmrc official just as post office official be be on commission for the money that they bring in through the loan charge the minister must confirm whether that be the case because if so it would act as huge incentive for they to pursue individual relentlessly secondly trust that the minister in his new position will challenge the department line on this matter we need great challenge than we have have so far thirdly believe that the loan charge need to be repeal because it be not fit for purpose and be have detrimental effect fourthly the employer and promoter must be pursue under the law they be responsible for collect tax from the employee that be the basis on which tax demand be now be make of people that they be employee not self employ fifthly of course we recognise that the government have to collect tax when it be due but the current method of pursue this will not bring in tax revenue because people be go bankrupt group of professional have propose that the government could claim back an affordable proportion of the tax that be owe they would get at least some tax revenue out of it while stop this relentless pursuit of individual in the long run think we need bill of right for taxpayer and for tax fairness to be build into legislation but that be matter for long debate there be people who be suffer today because they be be batter by the cosh that hmrc official be use on they to extract money that they do not have and which many of they do not believe they owe ask the minister to grasp this nettle and ensure that we do not have another horizon scandal as colleague can see this be very well subscribe debate with another debate to follow in order to give equal time to back benchers throughout the afternoon my advice would rather not put time limit on be that colleague stick to about seven minute be sure that greg smith will lead the way will do my good madam deputy speaker congratulate the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson not only on secure the debate but on the incredibly powerful and eloquent way in which he open it entirely endorse his speech indeed alongside the right hon gentleman and the noble baroness kramer serve as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on the loan charge and taxpayer fairness it be through that lens and give the many constituent of mine who be victim of the loan charge that have become profoundly trouble by what can only describe as one of the most significant crisis face by british taxpayer certainly in my living memory the loan charge have haunt and be still haunt thousand of our constituent throughout the country bring with it train of despair and destruction that should weigh heavily on hmrc and all of we in this house to date an estimate people have be affect by the loan charge tragically as have already be say of those people have come to the tragic conclusion of end their own life invite the house to reflect on retrospective hmrc tax policy that have lead to people pray no more end their life those be not number on page they be human tragedy each one be poignant reminder of the injustice feel by individual who be still grapple with the devastating consequence of the amount of money ask of they in some case more than they earn in the first place as the right hon gentleman mention the profound impact of the loan charge extend its reach far beyond mere statistic and financial repercussion it be devastating narrative that encompass contractor freelancer and agency worker from all walk of life those professional seek compliance under legislation take and follow professional guidance in good faith on the point about take advice and be lead by agency and promoter do the hon member agree that it be simply scandalous that none of those agency have be pursue by hmrc for their part in this and that that further heighten the injustice feel by those who be be pursue that be point on which we have consensus it be outrageous that promoter have not be pursue the all party parliamentary group have consider and take evidence on that and will certainly continue to push that point in this debate and for the week month and year ahead in try to get justice for all the victim of the loan charge and hold to account those who give that advice who suggest know what they be do thank my hon friend for give way and the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson for secure the debate do my hon friend agree that protect the coffer of the state should never take precedence over protect the life of our constituent my hon friend make an incredibly powerful point with which entirely agree part of the ask of this debate and of the all party parliamentary group on the loan charge and taxpayer fairness be fair settlement that people can actually afford to pay that take into account dare say it reality and that understand what people actually earn and that they act in good faith and take the professional advice that mention few moment ago will the hon gentleman give way one more time the hon gentleman be be generous be it not the case that what we need be proper transparency in how government body operate when so many people see these problem again and again that really undermine trust in government agree with the hon lady of course we need transparency across all walk of life government or otherwise the right hon member for east antrim refer to the horizon scandal and the post office there be clear similarity and there need to be an inquiry and serious action how can body of the state the post office in the case of the horizon scandal and hmrc in the case of the loan charge scandal be autonomous in be judge jury and executioner at the same time we simply have to take that away check and balance must be build into hmrc if we be to see justice for the loan charge victim as well as for victim of any other scandal that might well come about could say much more on this subject but be mindful of the time limit that you have set madam deputy speaker be incredibly grateful to my hon friend the minister for his letter yesterday offer meeting with the all party parliamentary group hope that we can get that meeting in the diary as soon as humanly possible so that we can have meaningful dialogue on how to get to settlement review of hmrc practice and justice for the loan charge victim give the colleague whom have see bob particularly from the conservative benches suspect that we will hear many more powerful story and testimony from victim of the loan charge whose life we should see as totally valuable and deserving of our attention and of justice be grateful for the opportunity to speak in today debate and congratulate the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson on have secure it thank the backbench business committee for grant the debate declare my membership of the loan charge and taxpayer fairness all party parliamentary group as we have hear this be long stand issue that continue to have an impact on the health and wellbeing of thousand of people right across the country include resident of merthyr tydfil and rhymney among they be my constituent geraint owen whom have meet on number of occasion over long period of time he and other victim of this scandal have experience considerable frustration in attempt to deal with hmrc the way hmrc have deal with this issue have cause unbelievable hardship distress and anxiety for large number of the people we serve this sorry saga bear strike similarity to the post office horizon scandal which we have hear so much about in recent week ordinary people up and down the country be be ask for unrealistic payment which be cause huge financial hardship bankruptcy and bad such as the risk of lose their home and an increase risk of suicide there be real concern that this be another scandal where the government have ignore the alarm bell and cry for help so urge they to revisit it and ensure fair and more effective approach this debate be huge opportunity to highlight the injustice of the loan charge scandal at recent meeting of the all party group we hear more harrowing story about how people life have be rip apart by the loan charge the government approach have mean that ordinary people who be victim of mis selling be face huge bill which be cause they untold distress and personal harm tragically the number of suicide link to this scandal have reach double figure clearly labour support attempt to tackle tax avoidance scheme but that be not what we be talk about in this case the fact that there have be so many shocking account of harm and distress suffer by people liable to the loan charge include those we hear at meeting of the all party group demonstrate how the government approach have go badly wrong labour have consistently call for fair and effective approach from hmrc instead of the current approach which be extremely tough on those catch up in these scheme we be clear that the morse review can not be the final word on this matter we table an amendment to the finance act that would have force the government to review the impact of the scheme and the fairness of hmrc implementation of the policy and propose new clause to the finance act that would have require the chancellor to commission an independent review to consider hmrc approach to the loan charge scheme and make recommendation on how it should be alter it would also have require the government to explain to the house of commons what effort they have make to guarantee the review independence we need fair and effective approach from hmrc instead of the current approach which be extremely tough on those catch up in these scheme but weak on their architect as the all party group previously suggest the tax burden should not fall solely on the individual user of the scheme but should be share by the employer and agency and also ideally and appropriately the operator and promoter of the scheme on that basis the government should change course and announce fair approach we must remember the human impact of the loan charge as we know and as touch on early hmrc have confirm that there have be suicide of people face the loan charge it have also confirm that there have be suicide attempt that in itself should be enough reason to stop this cruel retrospective policy urge the government to accept that there be something deeply wrong with their current approach to the loan charge scheme report to the treasury select committee last october state that around people still face the loan charge mean that four and half year on there be still many unresolved case the current approach have not work hmrc be still try to resolve ten of thousand of case and family have lose love one to suicide this whole sorry saga be cruel and unacceptable action be need now the government must think again when ordinary people who be the victim of mis sell face financial ruin and personal harm because of the way the loan charge have be pursue action must be take urgently hope that in sum up today debate the minister will address the point have make will try not to repeat everything that have be say but it be very difficult not to one thing relevant to this debate that discover in government and that have constantly observe be that hmrc be very peculiar department hmrc be unaccountable it be the only department that do not publish account every year so there be no scrutiny of money lose or fail to be gain hmrc act independently with many civil servant go on radio and television not reliant on ministers to take the responsibility for they that have be one of the big problem the backdrop to this issue be that hmrc operate almost with impunity have see minister come and go at the dispatch box who be tell one thing by hmrc leave their position and then come back and say do not know half of the stuff that be go on simply say that there be problem with hmrc regard the way that hmrc work campaigner have often ask to see draft document that be hide from they for example they be not able to see draft of report one of the thing evident in the post office horizon fujitsu scandal be that hold back information be detrimental to justice do the right hon member agree that that information should be make available wherever it be practical to do so absolutely which bring back to the point be just make mean no insult to the civil servant who work very hard it be simply that the culture of hmrc be one of impunity it do not behave like many other government departments we have problem with other departments run one so know what that be all about but hmrc act very differently from they and ultimately it be protect by the treasury that be where one of the big problem arise and it be why it be so difficult to get any information out of hmrc because even the ministers who be in charge of it seem unable to command or direct it to provide that information make that observation from have work in government my right hon friend be make very powerful point about hmrc it be the product of forced merger of the inland revenue and her majesty customs and excise by think gordon brown and the labour government the merger be rush they be push together and hmrc have never enjoy the proper scrutiny and ministerial involvement that it should have receive do my right hon friend agree that now be the time for root and branch review and change to the nature of hmrc retain its independent function of course but allow for great ministerial oversight agree do not intend my speech to head off down this track but will observe that it have now become clear that hmrc be unable to find any legal basis to justify its claim that it have to pursue individual but not those who promote the scheme hmrc have try to deny that for some time but it have now become very clear even its head the permanent secretary have state that in recent month have repeatedly try to obtain legal analysis to understand the strength of our claim with very little success for yesterday hear we be initially give summary of avoidance win some of which seem to have nothing to do with the scheme simply say that hmrc still can not justify the legal basis for pursue individual and not go after those who promote the scheme will my right hon friend give way be conscious of time if my right hon and learn friend will forgive other have to speak and be go to try to stick to madam deputy speaker prescription apologise to he will quickly raise the case of three of my constituent gareth lloyd joe green and karen duberry all of whom have be face terrible imposition be sure many colleague have see similar case gareth lloyd say that face and now pay the loan charge have mean year of stress with constant stream of demand and letter from hmrc when should have be enjoy watch my young family grow up ve be constantly at fear of potentially lose our home joe green say nine year of worry nine year of anxiety nine year of not know what to expect from hmrc other than continual bullying tactic to try and extort monie from with threat karen duberry say that she be shock and alarmed when learn of the loan charge feel alone scared threaten and worry for and my family the mental stress on and my family have be immense we know that because at the far extreme of these case people have commit suicide but there be many other problem between the extreme all these people deserve process that be well fair open and reasonable and that go after those who originally promote the scheme these people be under the impression as be the case that the scheme be quite legal the important point be that hmrc conjure up retrospective process to deal with this which be appal historically that have not be do you deal with where you be at the beginning but hmrc feel it have lose whole load of taxation and do not want to blame itself what it do be to go after those individual threaten they and cajole they an inquiry take place but it now appear that the morse review be not entirely independent give some evidence as many do to the original inquiry and assume at the beginning that it be completely independent in fact it turn out that it be not hmrc get to see element of the report before it be even publish which be astonishing to as we be give clear understanding that it be to be independent there be much more that need to be do and that review be by no mean the end of it be surprised when my right hon friend the member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman who be the minister at the time say we have plan under way to crack down far on the promoter of these avoidance scheme it turn out that he do not why be minister allow to stand at the dispatch box to make statement draft by civil servant which we then find out be not right he be not right hmrc be go after the individual not those who promote the scheme as we have discover hmrc have no legal basis for do that so the whole thing have become terrible mess congratulate those who bring forward this debate because there be so much more here that need to be say just want to conclude by say that this have be go on for too long with law change retrospectively denial about what hmrc be do bullying and intimidation and failure to come clean about the process engage in all of this it be so familiar as the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson say we be in the middle of the problem over the post office and we see the same thing in that process we have be see the same denial protection and pretence with the loan charge for long time it be very clear now and hope the minister agree that we be long past the point where we need to start recognise that this be not the way for any government department to behave when deal with an issue such as this that have clearly create huge problem my constituent and many other who have face this issue should not be pursue in way that treat they from the start as criminal rather than as somebody involve in something that hmrc never say be illegal at the time but be now pretend that it be hope the government will now recognise that we do not want to see repeat of what happen with the post office scandal as result of hmrc bad behaviour start by thank the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson for secure this important debate and by acknowledge the many thousand around the country affect by the loan charge know that some of they be in the gallery today include some of my own constituent pay tribute to their dignity and determination in pursue their cause will focus first and foremost on the fundamental unfairness of the loan charge but also as have be mention on the morse review and the need for great transparency have be contact by number of people whose life have be turn upside down by the charge while it be not possible for to give voice to all of they today would like to share one story that think speak to the experience of many have be force to raise huge sum include borrow from my mother and by borrow huge sum against my home leave in position where can not plan for my own or my family future the impact on my mental and physical health and my relationship have be huge and be in genuine fear for my future wellbee if hmrc be allow to continue unencumbered another constituent in great distress tell how she make the difficult decision to have an abortion base on concern about affordability stem from the loan charge combine with the number of suicide that have take place this paint truly harrowing picture of the impact this unfair charge be have the report by the loan charge appg publish in find that there be direct interference in the morse review by both the treasury and hmrc and that both organisation make clear attempt to direct the review from the outset give the tragic impact of the charge and the public interest in this matter surely it be time the government set up genuinely independent review that achieve fair and final resolution for all shall end by raise final point about the need for great transparency late last year one of my constituent be successful in overturn the information commissioner decision to allow the treasury not to release the final draft of the loan charge review the original freedom of information request be make in december yet over three year later the material have still not be release my constituent tell that their attempt to obtain the documentation have be meet with what they consider to be deliberate attempt to avoid foi obligation include be tell by the treasury that the information have be destroy then that it could not be find and eventually that it be prohibitively expensive to locate it such lack of transparency undermine trust in our institution and must be address hope the minister can assure that the government will look into this particular matter and take all reasonable step to ensure that the information be release as soon as possible with over people directly impact and the tragic death of people it be vital that we do everything we can to find fair and final resolution to the loan charge scandal to gain public trust far great transparency from hmrc and the treasury be need most importantly we need new and genuinely independent review to take place if as ministers insist the law be clear in it would have be entirely unnecessary to have the legislation open up previous tax year because my constituent who have be affect by this mis sell scandal for that be what it be make their tax arrangement entirely clear in those year and be unchallenge by hmrc within the proper window available it be entirely unnecessary and the reality be that the vendetta that hmrc be now pursue notwithstanding the obfuscation of the write answer to parliamentary question be exclusively against the victim of that mis sell scandal happy be those member of this parliament who be not here in and do not vote in favour of the finance no bill of which contain the measure that be now torture so many of our constituent we be culpable for not have spot not have ask about and not have examine the consequence and implication of the measure that be bring before we it be measure that cry foul against every tenet of proper legislation with first its retrospective aspect and secondly its take away from our constituent the right to appeal to tribunal with an administrative or quasi judicial process to have their case fairly consider it make hmrc both judge and jury in their case and what judge and jury it turn out to be we now come to another of these debate in which we recount the late injustice and enumerate the rise tally of suicide and the minister will in all probability make the same speech as his predecessor make the last time ask hon member what be the point the point as see it be that it afford recur opportunity for hon member to recant what the house do when it create this injustice drip by drip and member by member the tally will increase and ultimately it will reach the public consciousness the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey serve on the all party group and we be indebted to he for his chairmanship when he be in the chair of the group he have be hound over the last few week and find himself in very unfortunate position for be the postal affair minister at the height of the horizon scandal notwithstanding the fact that he be lie to on an industrial scale nevertheless it have be very uncomfortable for he to have the charge that he do not ask the right question he do not pursue it enough and he do not spend time with the victim let that be an object lesson to we and to all those ministers who stand at the dispatch box give we flannel and peddle the fiction that the limited inquiry be in some way independent my advice to my hon friend the minister today be this set aside the brief that you have be give and end this debate by just say that you have sit here you have hear what we have say and you be go to go away and ask the awkward question and spend time with the victim because ultimately this will reach the public consciousness we may even have our own tv drama the reality be that there be plenty of scope for such drama and when it do reach the forefront of public consciousness we will rue the day that we do not take the action when we could that be phenomenally good speech also congratulate the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson on secure this debate and for his powerful and passionate speech which be very impressive also thank the all party group on the loan charge and taxpayer fairness and the loan charge action group for their diligent work on this very serious issue and indeed my own constituent who have suffer greatly from this total injustice on july state in this house that the loan charge be go to be the next post office scandal and just look where we be with that today will it take another modern form of the stock by way of further itv drama to expose and publicly humiliate hmrc or the government into some action on the loan charge scandal unfortunately it would seem so but certainly hope not as other have say vitally important part of the loan charge scandal be that these ordinary people be contract worker do job of work for somebody or some organisation that simply need their service most importantly they be worker and as worker they be entitle to protection under the agency rule the agency rule determine that their employer be that the agency the umbrella company or another body in the supply chain or the end client itself be liable to deduct the correct amount of paye and pay that to hmrc at the time before pay the worker their salary these company simply do not do that hmrc be well aware of the arrangement and as have be say do not pursue for tax any of the entity as the worker employer hmrc be also well aware many year down the line that it be legally out of time to do so hmrc have and still have duty to establish who the employer be and who be direct control and supervise the worker who have be supply it have not do so it have fail time and again to do so hence the invention of the retrospective loan charge to get around that very inconvenient and uncomfortable fact it be entirely unacceptable to continue to hound ordinary worker with no right or fund for legal defence against such powerful government body as hmrc this have all the hallmark of the post office scandal what be really vexatious and concern be that hmrc continue to hoodwink mps into believe that it be go after the promoter who put the worker into this abominable position when we all know it be not do so further issue be that these group of company these promoter that sell arrangement to freelancer have not only not be ask to pay penny of the dispute tax but their cause the death of poor soul who be so distressed by the way they have be hound and criminalise by hmrc that they take their own life we all know that hmrc have state that total of people have take their life over this scandal the figure be likely to be far more in reality in this awful and unravel scandal the number of people affect by the post office scandal be likely to be dwarf by the number affect by the retrospective loan charge scandal purely and simply because of the number of people affect between and at the last count by hmrc with the figure likely to rise far higher too many ordinary people be face huge bill and many of they have be suffer untold distress for many year and in some case personal harm and indeed suicide because of this ongoing retrospective loan charge scandal the whole thing be an absolute mess be sure that ministers must by now be mindful of all these serious issue so will the relevant finance minister and the government now speedily commit themselves to finally commission truly independent review to deal with this mess wholly of hmrc own making and thereby allow we as mps and parliamentarian to help to right this grievous wrong this be such an important issue for our constituent and be very grateful to the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson for bring it to the house it have be mention that give the recent example that have expose excess of power in public body it be only right that the loan charge and the way it be infringe on the right of individual be debate in this house one particular case in my constituency bring this issue to my attention and it highlight several problem with the way hmrc have try to combat disguised renumeration scheme through the loan charge the way in which hmrc be retrospectively try to obtain income tax and national insurance contribution raise important question the first of they be that the law on tax should be knowable and accessible to the people to which it apply base on the case that have see in my constituency that be clearly not the situation many individual who work for agency simply do not know that their pay would one day be subject to dispute tax argument with hmrc because the loan charge do not exist or because they be mis sell such scheme by hire agency add to this fundamental trespassing on the right of individual be the fact that we can not continue with the situation whereby public body be pursue retrospective action against our constituent with they have no right to due process first thank the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson for his kind word about my time as postal affair minister my hon friend be make the point that this be really good example of why retrospective policy be not good idea there be the fact that hmrc need to use its investigatory power which outstrip those of policeman proportionately the fact that it should be go after the practitioner and promoter of these scheme which it can do under the rating coronavirus and directors disqualification dissolve companies act that pass few year ago and the fact that it should not be go after contractor consultant and self employ people who the government and many government institution treat as tax evader as the default as be see with the million exclude during covid who feel they do not get the support that other do that bring to one of my main point these be ordinary worker these be our constituent they be not fat cat they have not get offshore bank account they be not like that these be ordinary member of the public who desperately need our help that bring on to another point which be how hmrc be handle these case it be not unfair to say that it be hardly lesson in how to handle dispute resolution or customer service one of my constituent receive letter some four or five year ago tell they that hmrc be withdraw the information notice it have send in the post as far as my constituent be concern that be the end of the matter and they could get on with their family life there be no contact for further three year but now hmrc have inform my constituent that withdraw an information notice be not the same as withdraw its concern and that in any event it be not aware of the reason for the withdrawal in the first place and it would like to revisit the matter say to ministers that the situation be untenable hmrc can not have the power to suddenly request ten of thousand of pound from individual appear to drop case and then revive it on whim without any explanation at all that be an exercise in excessive power by public body we should be go after the dispute tax from those who promote and operate the scheme and who make huge amount of money do so understand that might be more complex but that should not be barrier we should be protect ordinary worker from abuse of power and pursue those opaque and monied body that seek to game the system will end on that note echo the point that these be ordinary people we be try to assist it be time that the government act begin by thank the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson for bring forward this incredibly important debate the issue have be live for far too long and the damage that have be inflict on thousand of ordinary worker whether freelancer contractor or temporary worker and their family by the loan charge be distress the comparison that he draw with the horizon scandal be real this be serious injustice but what be different from the horizon scandal be that at least the horizon victim have the appearance of justice it may not have be justice but they have the appearance of it as the hon member for buckingham greg smith make clear hmrc have persist and act as judge jury and executioner with ruthlessness that can not believe have be in meeting with hmrc and it have advise we will never put people under enormous pressure we will not take more than of their disposable income to recover the cost but that be simply not true the ferocity with which it have go after my constituent and the amount of money it have demand be eye watering it be completely impossible for my constituent to meet its demand simple point occur to the real similarity between the horizon programme and this situation be that those who be prosecute under horizon and put in jail and so on have it put about by the post office that they be greedy people who have steal money so the public at first do not have any sympathy similarly in this matter hmrc have basically say that they be greedy people evade tax that other people then have to pick up and pay the public still have not pick up on that these people be not do that that be the key point and break through that will get public support for something to change thank the right hon gentleman for that point not only be the victim of the loan charge victim of mis selling they be now the victim of hmrc pursuit of they for every penny they can possibly earn that be not just now but for future year so that point be incredibly important it be important to remember that we have an opportunity number of year ago to write off the retrospective element with new clause to the finance bill which be support by the loan charge and taxpayer fairness all party parliamentary group unfortunately because of the timidity of some member that new clause be not put forward for vote that be deeply regrettable it be important that speak about my constituent who be my main concern in all this four year ago speak about the horrific plight of my constituent doug aitken who be face bill of to pay that off he would lose his house and his car as employ person he would lose his business because he would be bankrupt the government simply do not listen he be one of those who have successive complete and closed tax year that be reopen by hmrc and he be be charge exorbitant unjustifiable and unjustified rate for all the suppose earning he have secrete away today want to speak about another constituent of mine alan geddes who have disposable income of month the payment demand by hmrc from mr geddes be month for the next year that be not the only charge it be ask he to pay it be also ask he to pay up front the hon gentleman and many other colleague across the house have make analogy in their excellent speech between the horror of the horizon post office it scandal and the scandal around the loan charge which have affect so many of our constituent will share with he and the chamber another analogy be he aware that hmrc also use an apparently bombproof system from fujitsu the hon gentleman make very interesting point to which think member from all part of the house will pay close attention thank he for do so not only be hmrc ask for up front but it have put lien against mr geddes home although his disposable income have now drop below month because of the cost of living crisis hmrc have suggest that perhaps they should renegotiate his term to bring the rate down to however to get that new rate he need to give hmrc another those other charge would then continue for further year the question be what planet be hmrc on these shocking figure exclude interest be add to allow the payment to be spread over year it be clear daylight robbery minister in the department have previously advise that approximately of the billion that hmrc have recover through disguised renumeration settlement between the budget of and the end of march have be from employer be therefore correct in presume that that figure be billion give that the sum that hmrc expect to be bring into charge from employer have already be exceed why do it need to pursue loan charge customer for of the tax plus interest plus accelerate payment notice penalty and plus inheritance tax particularly when it be fully aware that customer have already suffer to deduction on their earning through the mis sell scheme additionally would like to learn why hmrc continue to pursue customer with loan from before december give that morse already pardon those with no open inquiry on the basis that the law be not clear those key factor could all be address because hmrc have the facility to amend its settlement term it require no legislation or change in the law hope that the minister will ask hmrc to apply the same treatment to those who have already settle member across the house have be scream on this issue until we be hoarse we have send repeat letter include one send by mp we have have publication put out by the appg and debate in this chamber but it be simply not enough people be on the brink and in despair if we be to prevent any more constituent from resort to suicide we must urgently deal with this issue and grapple with it in way that be not do with the horizon scandal rise order because some colleague have take slightly less than seven minute have bit of leeway do not want speech to be extend massively but if colleague wish to speak for perhaps couple of minute more than seven would be content with that may join the congratulation to the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson on secure this important debate this be why parliament exist we be here to seek redress of grievance from an overmighty executive who abuse their power this be classic example of the state abuse its power through aggressive tax collection why be it that in the bible the tax collector be see as the villain on almost every occasion the tax collector be refer to it be because the tax collector seek to extract more than be by law allow in our system it have always be the case that the job of the tax collector be to raise the tax set out by parliament not penny more nor penny less it be not for the tax collector to squeeze out extra from people if that be not intend we know from this discussion that hmrc do not think there be anything wrong with these scheme early on how do we know that as the right hon gentleman point out it employ people use these scheme so we be say either that hmrc be so incompetent that it have no idea about the basis on which it be employ people or that actually because it save some money it think these scheme be licit the other thing we know be that constituent of our send in tax return acknowledge that they be use these scheme and hmrc do not question they then in panic worry about the tax receipt that be come be an important date when tax receipt be very low and the country have an enormous deficit squeeze get put on and that squeeze become retrospective but retrospective legislation be basically unconstitutional except in extraordinary circumstance whenever there be any retrospective part of legislation it have to be specifically approve and clear by the attorney general before it can be bring before the house why be that it be to safeguard the constitutional right that people know the basis of the law under which they be operate that be surely proper because with retrospective legislation people who have behave properly and honestly and follow the law that parliament have pass suddenly find that they have not that be entirely unfair and unreasonable and it could criminalise any of we for action we commit year ago do my right hon friend agree that in all these scandal the presumption of innocent until prove guilty have be turn on its head and we see the presumption of guilt and one be unable to prove one innocence to use biblical analogy this be not so much david versus goliath it be david versus an army of goliaths and david have have the slingshot take away from he my hon friend be absolutely right hmrc through the amalgamation of the inland revenue and customs and excise have extraordinary power customs and excise historically maintain extraordinary prerogative power much great actually than those of the inland revenue and the come together of those two body have bring more aggressive culture to our tax system it be culture that assume that taxpayer follow the law as they understand it and indeed as hmrc understand it may be do something wrong that be bad principle under which to operate member need as we be to look after the interest of constituent who be be affect in that way we need to allow people to know that their tax affair be clear after an inquiry have not be open that be set out there be month period in which tax return remain open and seven year period under which people have to keep record and yet we have pass retrospective legislation that overturn all of that my right hon friend the member for new forest west sir desmond swayne be absolutely right that those of we who be here in should be appal that this get through without be notice and without be stop what he say to the minister be absolutely right we should look carefully at the ministerial response hmrc be in the odd situation of be non ministerial department it be not properly accountable with most departments the minister say go and at least theoretically they goeth with hmrc its independence be such that it can effectively ignore ministerial control but that should work two way if the minister can not control hmrc he should not read out the rubbish that it provide for he to read out from the dispatch box and he should be well aware of the warning give of ministers who have either be willing to read out thing that turn out in future to be untrue or not ask the right question very much look forward to the speech by the shadow minister the hon member for bristol north west darren jones because he have the advantage of independence not have go native by virtue of be in the treasury he can bring hope an independent mind to this bear in mind that there will be an election this year and who know what may happen in that and what responsibility may fall upon his shoulder it be really important to know that the opposition be on the side of proper constitutional practice the whole point of our system be that we come here as we have do since the century to seek redress of grievance for our constituent when they be badly treat this be classic example and government be absolutely appalling at answer it people have mention the post office but it be not just that it be hillsborough and infect blood for some strange reason government have desire to defend the mistake of long since past administration and they do that to the disadvantage of constituent today hope that on this occasion it will not happen or at least it will not continue to happen there be an ability to set it right and there be an ability for the house to do more if hmrc be not produce document we have thing up our sleeve that the house can do to continue to exert pressure the backbench business committee can allow humble address motion to be table but it would be so much well if the minister at the dispatch box who be one of the most able and intelligent minister in this current administration be to grasp this and deal with it to save our constituent from further pain and frankly put hmrc in its box it be pleasure to agree with so many right hon and hon member which must say be novel experience for look at the history of this scandal it remind of the time when many of our constituent be claim work tax credit sometimes those credit be overpay and they would receive letter from the revenue which be standard letter but have individual clause stitch together to give the semblance of have be personalise one such sentence be etch on my memory it go like this even though we tell you that your assessment be correct it be not reasonable for you to believe so you this though be an extremely serious matter as think about how would approach the debate think that would tell the story of my constituent rob cowen who be victim of the loan charge scandal do however speak today for other colleague in plaid cymru and particularly my right hon friend the member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts who can not be here though she would wish to be while some people gain financially through the use of umbrella organisation and service rob cowan be use the scheme on advice as simple accounting service so that he could be pay legally and conveniently as so many other people find he have seek advice from accountant who assure he that the product he be use be legal only later do he find out that it be not rob have suffer immensely since then back in when he be in his early he be consider wind down his business change his work pattern move from full time to part time work and enjoy the fruit of his work over many decade he then start receive communication from hmrc inform he that he be liable to pay back thousand of pound due to the loan charge that force he back into full time work but that aggravate repetitive strain injury that he have develop over the course of his work life eventually that lead he to become disabled so he could no long work and make an income to pay back the money due under the loan charge at the age of rob find himself unable to work and unable to pay back the money that allegedly he owe and he face very bleak future he now have no saving and no ability to work he can not pay hmrc the money that it say he owe he have suffer psychological and physical trauma from this ordeal as have so many to give just one example which be sorry to say be common he tell recently that he be unable to switch on the heating during this very cold period he can not afford it as so many people have find thank the hon gentleman for share that powerful example have constituent in my livingston constituency who have suffer and who have come to see as the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg speak about the other scandal that we have face and challenge in this place be remind of the primodos scandal and the word of baroness cumberlege first do no harm it should be the duty of the government of the day and of this place to first do no harm to our constituent when harm be do and policy be wrong as this one have be prove to be surely it be the duty of government and hmrc to take some responsibility and not to put the hon gentleman constituent my constituent and other through hell before they get the justice that they need how many more folk need to die before this will be sort out thank the hon lady for that powerful point it be an old saw but justice delay be justice deny which be quite obviously the case in this matter my constituent also point to the stigma associate with what have happen to he as other right hon and hon member have point out he feel that he be in the wrong he be be make to feel that he do something wrong but he act in good faith throughout seek expert advice and follow the advice that he be give because he have no intention of do anything wrong in contrast as have be point out will finish on this point the owner of the company that run these scheme have make considerable sum of money rob feel that he have be deny fair hearing while other people have get away with it as the hon member for buckingham greg smith say hmrc be judge jury and executioner in its own case which be obviously wrong people be receive retrospective punishment even though they act in good faith there must be justice for rob cowen and the other victim of these scheme and of hmrc behaviour join the call on the minister to act quickly in the interest of time will try not to repeat all the self evident truth that have be state throughout this debate the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson make characteristically fluent exposition of the case everyone from he through to my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg reiterate essentially the same point all of sudden in the last few week the public have become aware that huge state or quasi state organisation put their own interest ahead of the interest of the public and unfortunately that be not abnormal behaviour the right hon member for east antrim quite rightly characterise that as be repeat in high handed and insensitive way by hmrc but frankly think he understate the point why do think that because hmrc have refer itself to the independent office for police conduct over those suicide and some other attempt suicide and self harm when deal with government departments that be as close as we get to confession those at hmrc know they have do wrong and they have know it for some time they have know that the consequence of this have lead to death and enormous harm to people yet they have continue to do the same thing over and again how on earth do they justify that when they look at themselves in the mirror the only thing can come up with be that hmrc think this be deterrent clearly it will not raise that much money three quarter of people will go bankrupt so maybe it be deterrent if it be that bring we to the next question that the right hon member for east antrim raise why do it not go after the promoter the promoter exact to of the income of these people in carry out this scheme so there be large sum of money there someone say hundred of million it may even be that the victim of the scheme that be the right word think that be the tax deduction because it be of that order of magnitude why have hmrc not do that we know that many of the organisation use those promoter and contractor be state organisation include hmrc itself that might be reason it do not want to embarrass itself it might be because of that that it be complicit in covert advice to those contractor at the beginning it be entirely possible that hmrc approve it and those document be hide away in hmrc what be the answer my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith be not quite right in say that hmrc be completely protect there be one body the public accounts committee that can get at this one of the thing that should come out of this debate be that the public accounts committee should look at the document not the number associate with those early contract and see why they be do that would be one way to get past the assertion make by my right hon friend the member for new forest west sir desmond swayne that we can not deliver practical outcome that be one practical outcome that we can deliver the second practical outcome we can deliver among ourselves be to address the fact that this be retrospective taxation as my right hon friend the member for north east somerset rightly point out our country do not believe that people who undertake behaviour that be not illegal at one point in time should be prosecute if it become illegal in future that apply in spade to taxis one of the thing want to do early on in our collective campaign be to move motion in the house at the beginning of the budget under the general motion that be normally put explicitly to ban retrospective taxation let we guess what happen since then the treasury have not move general motion we always get narrow finance motion which make it difficult to change anything write to the procedure committee which gather be still concerned about this to ask it to request the return of the general motion at the beginning of the budget then we could actually put it to the house back in those day we probably do not have the plus supporter that we now have today we could probably carry that motion ask everyone take part in this debate to support that might write around and ask everyone and to write to the procedure committee to try to get that correct we can use our right of initiative which we do not have much of anymore to stop this explicitly agree entirely on the amendment of the law resolution in fact whenever have speak on finance bill since it stop be common practice to use it have say that we should have an amendment of the law resolution appreciate what the right hon gentleman say about the procedure committee as member of the committee can tell he that we have look at this but ultimately it be the responsibility of the government to make the change they need to table the amendment of the law resolution the previous chancellor be clear that it be small technical change that he would not make forgive but have be here long time the procedure committee can do it it can put it to the house and seek back bench motion guess what we can move back bench motion that instruct the government some may remember that we do it on prisoner vote and we win that day it be about time that we exert our own right in this house on this matter the last point want to make be that this whole thing be if not precipitate then certainly make bad by the move by the government with what be now know as the complex rule associate with the trigger part of this behaviour pattern what be interesting be that the behaviour of hmrc on pretty much mirror its behaviour on the loan charge large number of people out there one of whom be in the gallery today have be oppress by hmrc frankly they have an argument over money let we say they win in the first tribunal so hmrc appeal they win in the upper tribunal so hmrc appeal again and take they to court the court of course then send they back to the beginning and they do it again the house will remember previous backbench business debate when we start the action against slapp strategic lawsuit against public participation in which oligarch use their huge financial power to destroy people what be hmrc do precisely the same thing the government be now move to stop oligarch do what they do themselves so we need to look at that too be disgrace when state organisation with infinite resource actually your tax money and mine use that power to overrule and reduce the ability of ordinary citizen to protect themselves be afraid it be behave in way similar to how country behind the iron curtain use to behave my right hon friend power of forensic analysis be second to none but do he agree that it be actually slightly bad than that he be entirely right in what he say but there be also case particularly for those affect by the loan charge where people have allow themselves against their well instinct and judgment to make false confession of guilt they have go through the process and end up have to pay an extortionate amount of money and think the matter settle then hmrc have come back and go after even more yes my hon friend be right be afraid that one of the characteristic of miscarriage of justice have forget who raise this point early so please forgive for not reference they be that the victim at the beginning be probably the most unpopular person in society they be think to be guilty and may even doubt themselves over whether they have make mistake these people by and large have be compel to do what we be talk about they have be offer job on these term only so they have have no choice but then they think well maybe should have know then like the sub postmaster they be persuade by the people deal with they that they be the only one until our campaign start all these people feel that they be the only one or one of few nasty tax evader not tax avoider so they give in of course it be like the gestapo confession never save you it be step to execution that be how it work be afraid that be true of all big organisation full of people who be well intentione but who defend the institution that be why answer my right hon friend the member for north east somerset it go on through government after government after government it be not the ministers who do this but the member of the institution get all of that and my right hon friend be right but there be peculiarity about hmrc with its power and lack of accountability it do not publish account and ministers come and go they do not really run that department that really be the issue bad as it might be elsewhere it be astonishingly bad now because of hmrc behaviour my right hon friend the member for north east somerset list few of the other case from hillsborough onwards so it do come back to that even the department for work and pensions the department my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith use to run have its own police force in effect and its own prosecutor that be one of the clue this will come back time and again with hmrc and other he be right that we need to hold this organisation to account it serve the people not the government of the day this parliament be the institution that serve the people and start with the public accounts committee we should be hold hmrc to account but there be many other who should get involve have give completely different speech from the one intend to give because everybody else say everything before rise but will finish with point certainly want to make the bbc once refer to as an old war horse so will give the minister some old war horse advice have be there once or twice myself one of the lesson of the last few week be that ministers junior ministers in particular be very easily lead to give dead bat answer in the chamber they be the answer hand to they by their official and they have no other answer to give unless they want to end their career on the spot have do that twice but never mind this be not about his answer today but the simple truth be that unless he want to be see in the same light as ministers in the past maybe he want to be future leader of the liberal democrats he need to go back to his department and say want to see the truth here be the thing you ve do why do you not tell the house of lords why you be not pursue the promoter of these scheme why do you tell people you only go for half their disposable income when you not do that get the answer minister then when you next come back to the chamber and you will have to come back to the chamber again you can give we the truth like everyone else in the chamber today have constituent who have be affect in way that be incredibly distressing so understand completely the howl of outrage sound across the house today want to deal with process though some hon member here take part in the debate in would like people to read the speech make in that debate by my hon friend the member for west ham ms brown be the shadow chancellor then and she be in my shadow treasury team speak from the opposition front bench she set out exactly case after case as hon member have do today but there be one additional case we draw on which have not be mention today case in which because of cut to local council and elsewhere staff have be lay off and then rehire on this basis by public body which be particularly shocking let read the ministerial response that be give then because think we should learn from it the then economic secretary say although have tremendous sympathy for those face large tax bill it be unfair to let people get away with not pay the tax they owe there be support for people who have use the scheme and now find themselves in difficult situation which require those affect to approach hmrc and bring the matter to close official report november vol that be the ministerial response do not think we can tolerate similar ministerial response today because that lead to immense human suffering include as some have say some people lose their life many of they do approach hmrc and they do try to negotiate deal but there be no element of clemency and no understanding of the individual plight of those people as result many of our constituent suffer badly just want to move on and try to get some resolution hope that we and the government can agree today on review that review should be immediate and time limit in month not year it should be truly independent with its independence assure by the victim it should propose specific range of resolution which will have to include some element of compensation for what people have suffer the review should look at where the compensation should come from think it should come not from from other taxpayer but from levy on those who promote the scheme and perhaps some element of the finance and accountancy sector that be involve up to their neck to be frank that be my first point also think that we need to review our own role in this and in what have happen over time agree with the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis that not only should the procedure committee examine the house role but the public accounts committee should look into how we have arrive at current situation let give two example of the background to all this hmrc have come in for considerable criticism today and agree with much of it what say now be not in mitigation of hmrc role but an attempt to gain some element of understanding of what have be go on there hmrc be rightly under pressure from all of we on both side of the house to tackle tax avoidance and evasion some of we have lead campaign over the last year or so to try to get hmrc to work on that effectively and pay tribute to the government for put it under pressure to tackle the tax gap they be the first government to identify tax gap of billion or whatever the amount be disagree with the figure but at least we have target to aim for however at the same time over those year both party have excel in dutch auction to establish the extent to which hmrc staff level can be cut can understand wish to reduce staffing but there be well way of do it and for while the way in which it be do at hmrc be fairly brutal that result in redundancy scheme whereby whole wave generation of expertise be lose and it have an effect on the culture of hmrc accord to my understanding hmrc look for short cut and way of meet the demand for it to tackle tax avoidance and evasion and the tax gap and think that this be one of the short cut that it invent in latter day there would probably have be wise head in hmrc itself to suggest that this be not the route to go down because it would bring about more problem than solution however culture of secrecy and protectionism have develop in hmrc and we need to understand that if we be to tackle this properly as an institutional failing secondly we need to look at the role that the house play have be go back to the year and try to remember what be happen in the house at that time some member will recall that there be not normal process for the finance bill because the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may who be then the prime minister have assure we all that there would not be general election think she assure we of that five time in the house go for walk in wales come back and declare an election so the finance measure be throw into the wash up procedure which as member will know mean political party sit down to decide what measure be urgent and must be pass it be agree that the finance bill would go through in single day and as result of that this measure be introduce should like the public accounts committee and other to look at how that process work and how it do not work the right hon member for haltemprice and howden make an extremely valid point which we make about every finance bill or budget bill that come forward when the government introduce the no amendment to law procedure that tie the hand of the house when it come to what it could open up what debate it could have and what amendment it could table that be introduce by hammond yes by lord hammond think it be almost unprecedented as say it tie the hand of the house even when it come to far investigate issue relate to the budget and finance bills also think that we need to look at the process whereby ministers and opposition be able to question impact assessment and how they be develop as well as the independence of those assessment still find it problematic that impact assessment be prepare largely by the department and the ministerial team that be promote the legislation involve rather than its be do independently have there be an independent impact assessment in this case and time for proper debate and for amendment as well the house would probably not have agree to take this course when look back think that the implication should have be draw to the attention of the whole house the impression give be that this would be focus on small number of hard case tax avoider or evader and their scheme promoter agree with nearly everything that the right hon gentleman be say but why can we not address it now why can we not go back and put it right the point be make be about enable we to do that hope that some of the lesson be learn be learn not just by the whole house but by the government as well whichever party be in power as soon as we introduce measure to fetter the role of individual member of the house or the house as whole we open up the opportunity for mistake to be make because policy be not test effectively in democratic debate in this chamber welcome the fact that review be to happen but believe they should happen as matter of urgency if for no other reason than because do not want to be here again in few year time we be now in and do not want to be here again in or and find that we be in the same situation as we be in do not want to find that more people have suffer and worryingly that more people may not be with we as result of this because they have take their own life there be an element of urgency about rectify this issue and do it with compassion and in many instance with clemency that will enable we to focus properly on tackle tax avoidance and evasion and also the institutional arrangement that exist to enable that to happen we need to have thorough debate in the house about our regulatory mechanism especially with regard to the accountancy and finance sector it have be refer to many time this afternoon but the number of time in the last few week that have speak here about the post office scandal be well know and it have rightly dominate our headline however the question that we have probably not address enough be why there be clearly parallel between why we have address the post office scandal and the reason for the encouraging speech we have hear this afternoon if there be one thing that the british people hate more than anything else it be injustice and it be the injustice of the loan charge scandal that make it so important the stark reality be that the people who be affect by it have have their life ruin at just the same level in term of financial as well as personal and family impact as those affect by the post office scandal have be member of the loan charge appg since be elect and have speak about it in the house when the appg run session back when be first elect hear harrowing account of people who be innocently catch up in this situation include some of my constituent my constituent peter phillips fall into loan scheme on the advice of tax professional as means to be clear of and compliant with you could not make it up there be never any intent to avoid tax it be simply means to keep up the income and standard of live that his work as contractor afford he have get to know peter over the four year since my election there be time when probably do not wake up in the morning without an email from peter he be watch this debate too he be good decent kind and law abide man like so many of the constituent we have speak about this afternoon if he have be aware of hmrc view on these scheme he would never have choose that route but it be never make plain to he either by the tax professional or by hmrc in addition he know many other contractor who have be work through loan scheme for many year without any issue with hmrc peter have settle his scheme with hmrc and quite rightly he be utterly aggrieve by the unfairness that because he tell hmrc of what he have do he become an easy target whereas the other who do not tell hmrc be get away with it so to speak that be grossly unfair and unjust in the loan charge scenario hmrc be treat the loan as both income and loan to the individual estate and be therefore force peter to pay income tax and inheritance tax on the amount we have be talk about this issue for while and many of the victim be old as they get old they be think about plan for their family so these issue become even more of worry and even more pertinent do not think he should but peter be prepared to accept that he make an error of judgment of course he do not make an error of judgment in my view this be retrospective penalisation by hmrc at the very least hmrc be equally at fault in the well know retrospective penalty that it impose it seem wrong that peter be pay penalty for his honesty in disclose the scheme if peter understand that he have to accept some responsibility why be hmrc not do the same and at the very least offer well settlement term to all those affect again the parallel with the post office scandal be that many loan charge victim be not believe these be complex tax arrangement in many case and they be simply mis sell to people the individual who take out these arrangement be not tax professional they just go along with what they be tell and as we have hear they have be financially crippled way beyond any sensible proportionate rationale they need help agree with other member who say we have an opportunity to put this right at the very least these individual could be well support in three way for start the loan should be exempt from iht where victim be subject to accelerate payment notice which occur when hmrc think it have detect tax avoidance scheme the dispute tax be pay to hmrc why be proper discretion not apply to the circumstance minister go back and look at the case and help the victim finally we should scrap or at the very least extend the residual tax waiver which have be thoroughly unjust time and again remember if person do not settle before september hmrc apply the penal loan charge and calculate the settlement give high figure that again have disadvantage many many people we take decisive action last week and many applaud we for that be the extent of the loan charge expose think there would be willingness in society to act something should be do and it can be do remember that so many people be innocently catch up in this scandal it have huge parallel with the post office scandal and it should be put right it be pleasure to speak in this debate thank my right hon friend the member for east antrim sammy wilson and the hon member for buckingham greg smith for set the scene secure the debate and bring this matter to the chamber believe that the job of this house be to act on behalf of our constituent although hmrc be independent it be tool of the government so there have to be some accountability with great respect believe that the ball will lie at the foot of the minister whom be very fond of at the end of this debate he will tell we what be go to happen the loan charge be controversial tax policy that have affect thousand of employee freelancer and contractor who be persuade or in many case coerce into use loan scheme to reduce their tax bill the policy introduce as tax relate measure in give hmrc the ability to collect taxis go back to april some people have face bankruptcy or depression or even commit suicide because of this ask the minister how it be possible for hmrc to investigate individual for unpaid taxis go as far back as year give that its limit for hold information on taxpayer be only seven year can not quite get my head around that how do person challenge year old tax demand do hmrc breach the gdpr by hold such information for this length of time the loan charge policy be unjust and unworkable it be retrospective tax that violate the principle of legal certainty and the rule of law it be punitive measure that target innocent taxpayer who act in good faith and follow professional advice it have result in disastrous consequence cause immense hardship distress and tragedy for thousand of people across the country it be retrospective tax of an insidious nature because it change the rule after the game have be play imagine win football match and then someone come and say by the way you do win you lose and here how it happen that be what have happen with the loan charge it ignore the fact that many people use scheme because they have no choice as they be force to do so by their employer or client it disregard the fact that many people who use scheme do not benefit from they as they pay fee interest and taxis on their loan we all seek professional advice daily in our job if we follow it because we believe that it be legal and correct we expect to be protect in this case people have not be protect the loan charge be retaliatory measure and impose disproportionate and unreasonable demand on taxpayer who have already pay their fair share it calculate the tax liability base on the total amount of loan regardless of the actual income or profit derive from they it add interest and penalty on top of the tax inflate bill to astronomical level it deny the right to appeal challenge or settle tax dispute at fair and independent tribunal it force people to pay the tax in one lump sum with no regard to their current financial situation or ability to pay hmrc employ process that have cause immense hardship and distress for thousand of people across the country it have push people into debt poverty and homelessness it have ruin career business and reputation it have damage mental health wellbeing and relationship it have drive people to despair and suicide accord to the loan charge action group at least people have take their own life because of the loan charge sobering figure it have also identify suicide attempt and case of serious self harm we need to remember that these be not just number but human life these be constituent colleague friend and family member how many more life will be lose before the government listen and act there be an immense responsibility on the minister and hope on behalf of our constituent that he can give we reassurance on this issue perhaps the most striking feature of all this be the brutality of hmrc ruthless approach which extend to cruelty it be no stretch to say that people be effectively pursue to the grave and beyond because bereaved family be ruthlessly pursue by hmrc for its demand hmrc continue to be unyielde and relentless it defend its action by claim that it have duty to collect tax that be owe and that it offer support and flexibility to those who be struggle believe that above else hmrc have duty to be competent and to uphold its charter which state that it will always act to get thing right hmrc be in breach of its own charter and the minister need to come clean and give we some reassurance on that the loan charge policy have fail on every level fiscal and human it have fail to collect the tax that it claim be due it have fail to uphold the principle of justice and fairness that underpin our tax system it have fail to protect the right and interest of taxpayer who have do nothing wrong it have fail to prevent the harm and suffering that it have inflict on thousand of people it have fail to acknowledge the error that have be make in implement and enforce the policy it have fail to respond effectively to the recommendation and criticism that have be make by various body include the house of lords economic affairs committee the loan charge and taxpayer fairness appg and the independent review lead by sir amyas morse to conclude in adherence to the timescale that be give the loan charge be policy that must be abolish it be not too late for the minister and the government to do the right thing it be not too late to end this injustice it be not too late to save life urge the minister and the government to listen to the voice of reason compassion and conscience and to abolish the loan charge once and for all the quick it be do the well what be go to say will echo what have already be say this afternoon but want to add my voice to those of all member and particularly to those of my constituent because bath constituent have be affect and want to help they as much as can the loan charge have destroy life of course business and individual should pay their fair share in tax however much damage have be do to people who act in good faith they have be punish in an entirely inappropriate way while those who be behind the scheme have get away scot free we must defend individual taxpayer even if we think that they might have be ill advise in the first place as we have hear many be force into the scheme and do not have choice the morse review conclude that the loan charge be not an appropriate or fair response to the use of payroll loan arrangement it focus on loan make many year ago they be not taxable under the law as it be understand at the time and hmrc do not act against they as enact the loan charge mean that income tax must be pay as if the outstanding amount be part of the income tax in the current tax year that do not account for change financial circumstance which be particularly relevant for freelancer those taxpayer pay much more than they would have if they have pay tax on the loan at the time the loan charge state aim be to end tax avoidance scheme which be understandable we all want to ensure that people pay their share however the central injustice be that hmrc have pursue only the user of the scheme who act in good faith instead of those who recommend promote and operate they as result the loan charge be not even deterrent there have never be conviction of those promote loan scheme that be now subject to the charge the people who be compliant and disclose information on their tax return have be hit the hard nearly all respondent to survey by the loan charge and taxpayer fairness appg report that the risk of payroll loan arrangement be not explain to they now some face tax bill as high as family have break down and there have be suicide people be make to feel like criminal despite have enter into the arrangement follow professional advice many have say that as contractor they have little or no choice but to enter the scheme many small and medium sized company owner and director be also impact after follow professional tax advice their staff now face redundancy as well as the awful mental health impact which the hon member for strangford jim shannon mention tax bill of hundred of thousand of pound leave some with no option but to go bankrupt in many case be declare bankrupt will prevent people from work again or pay tax none of that would have happen have hmrc identify the issue early publicise the risk of payroll loan scheme and penalise those behind they the nightmare now unfold have echo of the post office scandal where individual with no intent of wrongdoing be leave with impossible choice livelihood and life be be destroy while those run the scheme who know what they be up to be get away with it in addition government body be magnify the injustice pursue people with intimidation and make they fearful we should put that right rather than make this wrong even more wrong we urgently need genuinely independent review of the whole loan charge and fair and final resolution for all it be clear there be huge cross party interest it be in everyone interest to finally resolve this not just for those face overwhelming tax bill but for hmrc and the government the loan charge have not even achieve its intention instead it represent policy failure that have leave thousand suffer it be for all of we to act and act quickly call the spokesperson for the scottish national party congratulate the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson on secure this important debate and thank the backbench business committee for make time for it to paraphrase the hon member for strangford jim shannon this be an absolute mess it be not an ethereal mess or something that be not happen to real people it be happen to real people and affect their life today we have situation where the promoter and operator have face no recourse ten of thousand of people have have their life change and tear apart but hmrc have not be hold to account for its behaviour we must get to point where there be resolution an end must be find so that people do not have the sword of damocles hang over they first on the promoter and operator as have be say there have not be any arrest or prosecution never mind conviction of anybody who have be promote or sell the scheme look at debate from that time the then minister make it very clear that they be crack down on scheme not the individual who use those scheme and give commitment that they be chase promoter and operator whether ministers be lie to by official or knowingly come and tell we something that be incorrect do not know but we should never have be give those assurance which be patently false there have be consistent and concerted campaign of disinformation mp talk on behalf of their constituent as well as mp talk about the general issue have be face with disinformation whenever we have try to find out information we have be tell stuff that be untrue so agree with the right hon member for east antrim that we need to redouble our effort in fact it be not even that we need to redouble our effort because double nothing still make nothing we need to make effort to actually go after the promoter it be not only those promoter who promote scheme back in the day but the new one that be spring up along with other individual and organisation that be take advantage of people who be catch up in the loan charge scandal people be be tell oh you involve in the loan charge stuff can help you with that the person offer the help be then take their money and run for the hill that be still happen today but those folk and those organisation be not face any sanction for their behaviour the government need to ensure they be take action in many case the life of individual have be irrevocably damage communication have be terrible and there have be contradiction throughout every member who have talk about individual case have say that people have be give conflict information by hmrc people be tell if you pay this much it will be fine but then they be tell actually we ve discover we want another grand from you or we need this or we be go to serve an apn or we ve reopen tax year as constituency mp we have all hear report that people have be tell conflict information either every one of our constituent who have come to we about these issue be lie to we or this be actually happen tend to assume that this be actually happen and that people have be mistreat by hmrc that be major concern it be impossible even for mp to find out how much hmrc think people owe there be time when have have settlement figure and an amount on behalf of constituent and then hmrc have chase that person again for other money later as say it be sword of damocles hang over people they can not ever get to the stage of resolution because even if they settle hmrc can come back and say sorry we miscalculate we be go to chase you for another year there be no point at which people can get out of this trap have speak to so many constituent who whether it be because of the loan charge or other thing reach the stage where they be terrify of open envelope that come through the door those of we who be deal with constituent who be catch up in this know that they be terrify of open any official look envelope because it might be another demand for ten of thousand of pound it might be another demand for money that they do not have be follow the hon lady argument and agree very much with she do she not agree that this be almost contrary to jurisprudence there be no double jeopardy so person can not be try more than once for the same offence yet hmrc on those occasion seem to be do just that be concerned that we will not get to the end of this and that our constituent will never feel comfortable opening letter again they will never get out of it the minister need to look not just at this issue as whole but at each individual case it be very clear that there have be disparity in the way that people have be treat we be give the utmost reassurance that nobody would lose their home and nobody would be make bankrupt as result of this that be make utterly clear to we remember be in westminster hall when the minister stand up and make those promise those promise have dematerialise completely have constituent on universal credit whose only asset be his home and he have be ask for ten of thousand of pound not ten of thousand of pound over or year period but ten of thousand of pound today the only way that he can get that money be to sell his house that be directly opposite to what the minister tell we at the time we need to ensure that these change be make finally resolution to this be the most important point for this need to end so we need to get resolution for individual or for the whole group people need to be absolutely confident that they will never again get through the door terrifying demand from hmrc about something that they think have be sort out if we get proper resolution for each of those individual our constituent we will have do our job as constituency mp may start by congratulate the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson for hemel hempstead sir mike penning and the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows with whom have work for many year on the post office horizon scandal and the hon member for buckingham greg smith on secure this important debate today thank the backbench business committee for grant the time and pay tribute to the member of the loan charge and taxpayer fairness all party parliamentary group other right hon and hon member here in the chamber today and the journalist who have investigate this issue so doggedly include the yorkshire post one of my core political belief be that when one person have power over another they must be subject to effective check and balance that be crucial part of our democratic system and at the heart of the freedom that we should all enjoy in democracy such as ours in my role as lawyer trade unionist member of parliament the chair of parliamentary select committee the business and trade committee and now member of the shadow cabinet have always contribute to ensure that the delicate balance of power be tilt towards the citizen and away from the powerful and that unchecked power be challenge and bring into line on this issue today recommit myself to that cause that be why we in the labour party believe key principle of our tax system be that the government should treat everybody fairly it be why we support attempt to tackle tax avoidance scheme include disguised renumeration scheme however hmrc approach to the loan charge which have affect ten of thousand of people to date mean that the government have fail in ensure that duty of fairness as we have hear ordinary people who be victim of mis selling be face financial ruin and personal harm because of the way in which hmrc have pursue the loan charge tragically at least people affect by hmrc behaviour be know to have take their own life the house should pause and reflect on that fact we be talk about people who be in such state of people who have not only the thought of end their own life but the will to do so there be family now grieve for the loss of love one all because of an administrative approach to tax collection it could therefore not be clear that the government approach be not work minister include the prime minister when he be chancellor routinely refer to the morse review and assert that there be nothing else to do that review can not and must not be the final word on the matter or roadblock to get fair solution for people who have be victim of bad professional advice and mis selling while people in everyday job from nhs worker to social worker be be pursue by hmrc and some taxpayer be be tell that they owe hundred of thousand of pound the government as we have hear repeatedly be do little to pursue the actual promoter behind mis sell scheme incredibly hmrc have be issue few than two fine year against the architect and enabler of fail tax avoidance scheme how can the government possibly justify such light touch approach for the promoter of such scheme while many of those people catch up in they suffer such serious harm over the course of this parliament the labour party have repeatedly call on the government to find fair and effective way forward on the impact of the loan charge there be no disagreement that such scheme be illegitimate and damaging however there have now be significant case and testimony to raise alarm bell in the head of ministers about the nature of the current approach in june during consideration of the then finance bill hon member debate new clause that would have force the government to review the impact of the loan charge scheme include the fairness with which hmrc implement the policy unfortunately the government dismiss the proposal claim that the morse review go far enough again in december my hon friend the member for ealing north james murray table new clause to then finance no bill it would have require the chancellor to commission an independent review to consider hmrc approach to the loan charge scheme and make recommendation on how it should be alter that review would have require the government to explain to this house what effort they have take to guarantee the review independence also once the review have make recommendation it would have require the government to say on six monthly basis whether they agree with they and if so how effective they be on implement they such review could finally have offer way forward labour vote in favour of that new clause and the review it propose in december but sadly it be defeat by the government treasury ministers must realise that this issue be not go away two year on from that vote it be still clear that the government approach to the loan charge mean that ordinary people who be victim of mis selling be suffer financial ruin and personal harm minister and hon member across the house have hear the harrowing account of people whose life have be ruin that can not be what the government envisage in the first place and it must not be allow to continue will the treasury use this moment today to finally agree to commission far truly independent review such review could consider the approach of hmrc towards the ordinary people catch up in the loan charge scheme and far consider what action should be take against the architect and promoter of those scheme that would be in the interest of restore fairness in our tax system it could provide way forward for the many thousand of people catch up in the loan charge and should end the devastating consequence suffer by the people involve to date that be all we be ask for an independent review albeit one as hon member have say that should be conduct quickly finally urge the minister to answer the specific question put to he today of whether hmrc official be be award bonus payment for the recovery of loan charge money urge the government to learn the lesson of other scandal and to stop bury their head in the sand urge the minister to be brave and to do the right thing would also like to thank the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson my hon friend the member for buckingham greg smith and other for secure the debate and be grateful for all the contribution from hon member across the house would like to name they all because it be important that we get on the record all those who have contribute they include my right hon friend the members for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for new forest west sir desmond swayne for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg and for haltemprice and howden sir david davis my hon friend the member for north norfolk duncan baker the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and the hon member for merthyr tydfil and rhymney gerald jones for chesham and amersham sarah green for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath neale hanvey for arfon hywel williams for strangford jim shannon and for bath wera hobhouse and indeed other who have contribute to the debate there be no doubt that we have hear today the strength of feeling on the issue of course stand at the despatch box as not only the minister financial secretary to the treasury but constituency mp who have also have representation on these issue from my constituent the loan charge alongside the wide issue of the use of disguised remuneration scheme be complex subject that be deeply impactful for many of our constituent can assure hon member that the government take the issue incredibly seriously and recognise the impact the loan charge have have will endeavour to address the point that have be raise in the debate but also wish to reassure colleague that many of the question they have ask about disguised remuneration government policy the loan charge and the approach and tone take by hmrc be precisely the question that have be ask official for the very reason they have outline hope that during the course of my response can provide some additional reassurance because particularly in the light of recent circumstance want to make sure that be make the right decision and ask the right question tax authority and tax ministers be never popular it be the nature of the work but want to make sure that we act in way that be reassuring correct and fair to all taxpayer take that duty and responsibility very seriously for example have have discussion and conversation with jim harra the chief executive of hmrc in the light of the post office scandal about whether there be commission or perverse incentive for people that may lead to distort behaviour and have be reassure that there be not this debate and these conversation be very useful because they enable to ask the right question of my official will not be able to give everybody the answer they want and be go to disappoint some people with this response because believe we have take the right approach there be certain area where will continue to ask question be aware that will not be able to satisfy everybody today but that will never stop from continue to ask the right question briefly by way of context because not everybody who be listen to this may be aware the purpose of the loan charge be to ensure that user of disguised remuneration scheme pay their fair share of income tax and national insurance contribution disguised remuneration scheme be contrive tax avoidance arrangement that seek to avoid income tax and national insurance on income by disguise it as some other type of payment typically in the form of loan that be wrongly allege to be non taxable hon member should be in no doubt that as have be recognise across the house those scheme cost the exchequer and other taxpayer hundred of million of pound year indeed the total burden be to the tune of billion of pound it be therefore right that when we identify these completely inappropriate scheme we take action from the early day of the scheme hmrc open thousand of inquiry into their use and challenge their operation through the court in the supreme court agree that the scheme do not work and have never work to legitimately avoid tax so tax be due on these payment however as have hear very clearly in this debate many question have be raise about how we recover that tax due and who have pay it in the court of appeal rule that even where other party may have obligation to withhold tax under paye the liability for income tax be always that of the individual fully endorse long stand position of hmrc and of government of all colour that be key point the individual be ultimately primarily responsible for the tax they owe and for their own tax affair do the minister not recognise that quite lot of people who use the scheme who be make contractor against their will be often just individual who be not tax expert who pay the tax they be ask to pay at the time and do not think anything be wrong until year later when suddenly hmrc come to pursue they do he not recognise that he be do the wrong thing to those people who really do not know well thank the hon lady for her comment and understand completely where she be come from but there be multiple point to discuss there the scheme be never legitimate they be always tax avoidance and therefore there be always clear path that tax be owe with respect to who then pay will mention that in moment but if we move away from the underlying principle that individual still have personal responsibility to check their tax affair it be very difficult to move back to it will also come on to the point she raise about furth government action in moment because there be some people be be deceive and force into error that be completely inappropriate the early stage of such loan scheme involve the very wealthy and people who think we can all agree know exactly what they be do but as the scheme evolve and get more sophisticated and more people be draw into they there be long tail of people who be act in good faith and theirs be many of the case that we have hear today although we keep the principle that ultimate responsibility lie with those individual it be important that we do the right thing in ensure that tax affair be straighten rise will give way to the hon member for strangford far to the point make by the hon member for bath wera hobhouse think of those who be unknowingly bring into the scheme by their employer and then find themselves with financial burden that they be not aware of be remind of the tv programme about the post office horizon scandal in which the terminology the little people be use with the great of respect these people be the little who accept the system that be put down before they there must be way to help they completely understand where the hon gentleman be come from in relation to go after employer that have be deceptive the loan charge ensure that tax be pay in respect of individual who enter into the scheme and receive payment with no tax deduct but where possible hmrc have be seek that tax from the employer in the first instance would like to reassure hon member that of the revenue collect to date have come from employer so we be target the employer as he rightly point out rise will take couple more intervention but fear that colleague will ask about the very thing be about to come to so may then resist further intervention my hon friend refer to the supreme court judgment as understand it that judgment decide that responsibility for the use of an employee benefit trust for tax fall unequivocally on the employer so it do not necessarily support he in the way he may think there have be debate and disagreement on that particularly as it relate to section of the income tax earnings and pensions act and so on hmrc have outline the policy stance on this although understand that there be disagreement the line be quite clear at the moment agree with the minister that there be responsibility on all individual to ensure that their tax affair be in order and the correct tax be pay but what will he tell the house about hmrc responsibility to make the public aware that certain scheme may be see as tax evasion and therefore do not qualify for tax relief that be another important point to which will come in moment will now make some progress before take further intervention because fear that otherwise may ruin my response as say the way in which we recover tax owe be important include the interaction that individual have with key body such as hmrc the government recognise that there be area where the impact of the original loan charge be disproportionate to its aim we have listen to concern raise by hon member in the year since the loan charge be announce and have have conversation with hmrc about how it have for example endeavour to improve the tone of communication with impact individual change in approach be also make follow lord morse review about which have hear many comment today many people may not be aware but in september the government ask the former comptroller and auditor general of the national audit office lord morse to lead an independent review of the loan charge policy and its implementation lord morse have full discretion over how the review be run who he consult and the recommendation make that consultation include the appg and many of the people in the chamber today follow the review lord morse recommend notable change to the policy and the government accept of his recommendation those change benefit about people and mean that the loan charge would apply only to outstanding loan make on or after december rather than april that be the date when the government announce anti avoidance legislation that put beyond all doubt that the scheme be taxable very important date the loan charge would also not apply to outstanding loan make in any tax year before april where reasonable disclosure of the use of tax avoidance scheme be make to hmrc but hmrc do not take action again some have make that point today taxpayer be also give additional flexibility in the way they pay in line with their individual circumstance but lord morse be clear that the loan charge be necessary and in the public interest and should remain in force do the minister accept that hmrc official help to service the morse review and restrict its ground and parameter the original of that review have not be disclose and we do not know how it be change in the meantime there be great doubt about whether or not the morse review be ever an independent review and ever come to conclusion that would have deal with the issue and the unfairness we have be discuss today before the minister reply do want to say that have give he more time than would normally be allocate for backbench business debate several colleague have try to intervene but do be aware that we have another important debate to follow be sure the minister will be cognisant of that fact thank you for that guidance madam deputy speaker will try to proceed through the comment because be keen to make few more point the morse review follow the normal process for such review in term of the secretariat and support be provide by government departments have hear the comment make today but do not believe case have be make for another review always stand ready to listen but think that review stand up quite well do not think anybody have impugn the integrity of lord morse today but that review be thorough and significant and of the recommend change be implement it be hugely impactful and very thorough review many hon member have also make point about tackle promoter and some individual face the loan charge feel rightly aggrieve at the promoter and enabler who facilitate the use of these scheme promoter of tax avoidance scheme be parasite on the tax system let we be in no doubt about that they cause untold misery to the people they tempt into use those scheme which almost never deliver the tax saving that be promise the government have prioritise tackle promoter of tax avoidance scheme and have give hmrc additional power to do so as result of which many promoter have stop promote those type of scheme one individual involve in the promotion of scheme subject to the loan charge have already be convict and other be currently under criminal investigation for offence link to the loan charge through finance act in and the government also introduce power that allow hmrc to take action more quickly against promoter those include the power to publish detail of promoter of tax avoidance scheme and other involve in the implementation of such scheme in for example hmrc issue penalty of million to promoter of disguised remuneration scheme and provision include in the finance bill currently progress through this house will make it criminal offence to promote tax avoidance scheme after hmrc have issue stop notice under the promoter of tax avoidance scheme rule be very pleased to say that those measure be receive support from all party the government also consult last summer on measure to address non compliance in the umbrella company market again many hon member have comment on that market today include tackle the type of scheme we have discuss we will respond to that consultation in due course but can let hon member know that and my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake the minister for small business at the department for business and trade be already discuss what the next step should be in the meantime hmrc will continue to use its full range of civil and criminal power to disrupt the operation of promoter will the minister give way very briefly and for the last time really be get anxious we do need to move on very quickly call neale hanvey if he can be brief will be very brief madam deputy speaker one of the key problem we have be the inflationary cost that be add to the loan charge will the minister at least commit to look at those cost that be add on to the taxable sum the hon member will be aware that can not pre empt the conclusion of the consultation or our response to it but hear his point many member have raise the personal and emotional impact of the loan charge on their constituent this be something that the government and hmrc do take very seriously we recognise the distress that loan scheme user may feel when face with large tax bill on their earning often many year after the event which the scheme promoter wrongly tell they they would be able to avoid we be aware that some people who face the loan charge have very sadly take their own life or harm themselves hmrc have make referral to the independent office for police conduct where person have take their own life and follow each referral hmrc have conduct an internal investigation nine of the investigation have conclude and although no misconduct be find hmrc be take forward organisational learning from these matter to far strengthen the support provide in identify individual who need extra help completely understand the point raise by hon member and indeed have myself hear about the emotional distress from individual impact by the loan charge colleague have also comment on the nature and tone of interaction with hmrc in the past again have raise this with hmrc official and will continue to make the point that they should adopt more understanding tone other point of clarification be raise by hon member and will endeavour to write to they because there be few factual inaccuracy for example there be an appeal process it be very important to make that point and this be not an area in which criminal conviction be act against the individual will write to hon member because there be lot to debate in this area but it be very important to make sure that we do not scare people for example we must make it clear that there be an appeal process and there be of course no cost for the appeal process there be also other matter that would like to make hon member aware of be aware of the timing madam deputy speaker and thank you very much for your patience during what have obviously be very emotive debate today finally make an appeal would encourage those who still have disguise remuneration or loan charge liability to engage with hmrc thousand of people be still not engage with it and be therefore not able to seek clarity or the support and guidance available include emotional support help from the samaritans and other measure that hmrc have in place to identify and support vulnerable individual repeat my thank to hon member for their engagement and welcome continued engagement include with the appg and all mp who have raise this topic with on behalf of their constituent call sammy wilson who have one minute to wind up since time be short will not go through all the speech but thank member for take part and for the powerful speech they have make there be two point that will take away first there be the frustration fear and powerlessness that many of our constituent feel in the face of oppressive government bureaucracy and the pursuit of those individual by people who be not and currently can not properly be hold to account secondly to repeat what the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell say hope that we will not be sit here in four year time find out that although we have this debate we hear platitude from the minister and there be no action do not want to take part in debate similar to the one we have take part in today think it be the duty of the minister and the duty of parliament to hold those who have this power to account and to make sure that it do not continue to be abuse question put and agree to resolve that this house be deeply concerned that hmrc have confirm the suicide of people face the loan charge and that despite the morse review thousand face unaffordable demand with the risk of further suicide note that hmrc have also confirm case of serious harm include suicide attempt believe that many people who use scheme be victim of mis selling and that in other case employer and agency push people into use they yet hmrc be demand all dispute tax from scheme user not from those who recommend promote and operate the scheme further note that section of the income tax earnings and pensions act deem agency worker to be taxable as employee of those agency and that hmrc should have collect tax from agency at the time criticise hmrc transfer the liability to individual despite its own failure observe that hmrc be pursue open enquiry for scheme before despite the morse review also note that hmrc be seek additional payment from those who settle far believe that the morse review be limited and not genuinely independent of hm treasury and hmrc highlight the resolution propose by tax professional call on the government to work with all party to find fair resolution and for full independent investigation include into the conduct of hmrc and believe that taxpayer right must be enshrine in law and enquiry close after four year if hmrc fail to act high speed compensation beg to move that this house call on the government to provide compensation to people who have be affect by the construction of have call this debate on high speed compensation as be concerned about how my constituent in stafford be still be treat by ltd and wish to raise their serious complaint directly with the rail minister and to hear what he be go to do to address they since the prime minister make the decision to cancel phase of the rail project from birmingham to manchester many people include constituent of mine have be leave in limbo with no information about what be happen with their property or land this issue affect numerous constituency and thank the many colleague from across the house who be here to support this important debate today include many neighbour in staffordshire such as my hon friend the member for lichfield michael fabricant my right hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir gavin williamson and my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash today be call for all outstanding compensation claim to be resolve will set out number of example in my constituency that demonstrate that the issue of compensation be still long way from be conclude and must be deal with by the government let start by thank the constituent who have contact share their story and highlight how be deeply affect they several other constituent who previously ask to raise their case have now ask not to mention they by name today be outraged to discover they have be intimidate by to do this in one surgery appointment be tell that constituent be tell it would not be good for you to get your mp involve as that would be bad for your case this be completely unacceptable behaviour by ltd and want to call it out today declare an interest not in this case but as farmer because understand that have be contact by some in the national farmers union on this matter do the hon member agree that to demand land from farmer and not to compensate they quickly and effectively can never be acceptable and that if farmer can show loss of earning they should receive compensation for that understand they currently do not the hon member be absolutely right and if he bear with will specifically come on to compensation to farmer and the point the nfu have raise will the hon member give way let make some progress and will give way in few minute want all those seek compensation to know that they have not be forget be speak up for they all today to ensure their view be hear at the high level of government since be elect as the member for stafford have raise the issue of compensation six time in this house six time and have still not have all of my outstanding local claim resolve that be not acceptable when behaviour towards my resident have be shocking in addition have contact numerous relevant ministers and spend hundred of hour work on the issue visit affected constituent and advocate for they my first piece of casework as new mp involve constituent who experience the most awful mental health crisis because of the stress of the compensation process thank my right hon friend the member for pendle andrew stephenson who as rail minister work constructively with on that case appreciate too that the new minister my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle huw merriman have also meet recently to discuss these issue when the prime minister announce back in october last year that the phase of north of birmingham would be cancel welcome it as have long believe that be folly in november the prime minister state that we be commit to fair treatment for people affect by the report november vol while applaud the prime minister sentiment there should absolutely be fair treatment for all those affect by the change so today ask the minister to ensure that ltd pay compensation fairly that be the crucial question make even more pressing in light of the secretary of state comment back in november when he say he think that those affect by have be properly compensate accord to the law be sorry to say that that be not the case will go into more detail about why there have not be proper compensation in several instance when the route be announce over decade ago the value of property and land along the route immediately drop the land and property have become blighted and we have to set up very complex compensation system those go through the process be advise to hire private agent to assist they through the negotiating process but have hear from numerous people that the complexity of the process have mean that they be offer far small sum in compensation than the property be worth because of this process be not only complex but also extremely slow and be now be tell those live along the cancel phase route who wish to repurchase their property be do so at far high price this be clearly unacceptable why on earth should we be penalise resident who have already be force to sell their property and land due to the government build railway line through their home have constituent call siân froggatt and she have compulsory purchase order make against part of her farm involve land that be the only way she can access her farm three time she have petition to buy it back but it say no and the land will now go on to the open market how can that be right hope the minister will address this when the railway line will not even be go alongside she be willing to pay back the money for her land that be compulsorily take off she my hon friend make an extremely important point and agree with everything he say will give an example from constituent of mine in similar situation andrew collier be farmer in stafford farm acre purchase just over half his land and some of that land be earmark for utility the land be take before harvest time and he ask ltd for permission to harvest his crop say it would allow he to do that so the crop be harvest but then ltd give the crop to someone else and do not pay he for it mr collier apply for compensation hop that it would swiftly arrive of course that do not happen instead mr collier wait for two and half year for to compensate he emphasise that to the minister even now he be still owe hundred of thousand of pound to cover two year of lose harvest and other outstanding claim he tell that two member of his family who work on the farm have now have to leave because the remain farmland be too little for they to work on due to the compulsory purchase of his land and the long delay in receive compensation he tell in his surgery appointment that his farm be now no long financially viable compound those issue his sacrifice be now seemingly in vain because phase have be cancel and the land be lie fallow that example be why this debate today be so important for raise this issue there be fundamental lack of transparency and fairness in this entire process and believe it be cause real harm to my constituent how ltd deal with compensation appear to be completely divorce from practical reality on the ground another example be local golf club the course of which be in the middle of the countryside in my constituency club member be devastate when they hear that the route would cut straight through the middle of it what be to happen now similarly my constituent jean and trevor tabernor own farm route mean that their farm would be spar but their farmhouse be demolish their new farmhouse be nearly complete and they have be seek the last instalment of money to finish the work as we all would expect that need to be finalise as soon as possible so that they can complete the construction of their home however they be face delay and now that the line have be cancel be try to place restrictive clause on they in perpetuity just for my constituent to receive what they be owe those clause be clearly so that can maximise the value of its asset ltd be literally the only thing stand between they and their new home again ask the minister what will happen to resolve that it be affect people life and we simply can not wait any long for an answer turn to business affect and in particular how unsuitable the compensation process be for farmer in our recent meeting my hon friend the minister recognise that there be specific issue relate to farmer note that in his response to my hon friend the member for buckingham greg smith he publicly state that of the land that have about have be let back out to be able to be utilise want to make sure that we can well understand from the farming community what can be do with the land that be no long need thank the minister for those word know he have meet the national farmers union as indeed have in staffordshire and other to well understand these issue the point that wish to make be that if unused land be not preserve in its state on the day before farming end it will start slowly to deteriorate for cropland in particular that mean that the land be return to farmer will have to be rehabilitate currently at the farmer expense when we consider farmland it be clear that the compensation process be cause major financial issue by deprive farmer of the land that they farm and their ability to forward plan also have example of constituent who have not yet reach an agreement with ltd when the prime minister make his announcement may ask the government not to forget about those resident who also need to have their compensation resolve on how ltd propose to dispose of phase land follow the cancellation of phase it have consistently tell resident and business owner that it must act to ensure value for money for taxpayer as conservative support that in principle but value for money in this context appear to mean short change those from whom it have purchase land and property the issue with the proposal be simple ltd be focus purely on ensure that it receive the high price for the land and the property it have compulsorily purchase but there appear to have be little thought give to those whose land have be take off they and wish to have they back the nfu have highlight the issue and be call for simple and cheap process for return land very much support that as part of the process most property and landowner who have their land compulsorily purchase will be offer the right of first refusal under the crichel down rule however the value of the land now will naturally be high than when it be blight and they will also be high because land and property price have increase in general farmer in particular and all those affect tell that they be have to buy back their own land at far high cost that be unfair would like the minister to look at that again if the right to first refusal be not take what will happen to that land and property someone will purchase it and particularly with farmland there be an additional danger that developer and land banker might be keen to buy it which would completely transform the make up of former rural community there have be serious lack of transparency from throughout all this be shocked to read recently that the chief executive of ltd reveal that the cost of phase have already increase by billion to billion what horrific waste of taxpayer money finally raise the importance of the handsacre link which would bring compatible train to stafford it be advertise as the reward for the people of stafford for endure so many year of issue associate with the project it would ensure that phase be complete and lot of the work require to construct it be under way raise the rail link previously in april last year when be assure by the secretary of state for transport that the work would continue to progress but hear rumour that it be to be cancel that would be not only betrayal of my constituent and waste of the time and resource put into the construction that have already be complete but this be key point breach of the legislation that specify that it must be build will the minister reassure my constituent that the handsacre rail link will be complete this debate be important because my constituent be still live in uncertainty the process surround compensation be flawed and ltd continue to behave disgracefully finally may invite my hon friend the minister to visit in stafford to talk directly to my constituent and see at first hand how the delay and the lack of fair payment be affect they and ask he to commit today to do something about that compensation must finally be resolve thank the hon member for stafford theo clarke for secure this debate as members may know part of my constituency lie directly above the tunnel in the chiltern hill where the tunnel boring machine be due to surface particularly affect have be those live near the five vent shafts near chalfont st peter chalfont st giles amersham chesham road and little missenden for some the impact have be so severe that they have feel unable to continue live in their home decision to move be never take lightly and they have invariably bring they into contact with various compensation scheme wish to focus on the experience of constituent with one particular scheme the special circumstance or atypical property scheme the scheme be set up in recognition that some resident and business near the route may need assistance despite not meet the eligibility requirement of other scheme the first case shall share be that of constituent who live in close proximity to one of the vent shaft they experience the construction of haul road immediately outside their property where once there have be country lane use largely by local resident now there be large road with hgv traffic travel up it night and day in addition metre high embankment be construct immediately in front of their house ruin their view their privacy and the value of their property face with at least another year of construction work and the permanent blighting of their property my constituent reluctantly decide to seek compensation from which would allow they to move they have this to say about their experience deal with and its contract partner have be nightmare they will not properly engage regard compensation and on other matter they continually delay answer question provide incorrect and contradictory information change their plan without proper notice or consultation and have no regard for the wellbeing of the community they block all attempt at proper dialogue ignore question and hand matter to different team to delay thing far if we complain we might get half hearted apology for the time take to respond at all but nothing change thankfully after much stress and inconvenience the government eventually buy my constituent property at unblighted value under the special circumstance or atypical property scheme but it should never have be that hard the delay contradictory information change of plan at short notice and half hearted apology lead to unnecessary delay distress and upset it do not have to be that way the second case shall briefly share involve constituent who move to their home in two year before be announce where previously the enjoy starlit night they now face floodlight on at all hour the disturbance and upheaval take toll on my constituent mental health result in their make the difficult decision to sell their home initially seek to steer the couple towards the need to sell scheme which would have force they to sell their property at market value rather than the considerably high unblighted value after much wrangling include intervention from my office agree to consider the couple as an atypical case part of the problem be that there be no formal application process the process be opaque unfortunately agree to consider my constituent as an atypical case be in many way just the beginning the couple emphasise how degrade the process to finally be accept be despite provide gp and support worker detail to more than once they continue to receive repeat request for ever more information with each request bring up renew worry and stress both the case have reference today eventually result in the individual be accept to the special circumstance or atypical property scheme but the process to get there be protract stressful and awful that be what want to highlight the scheme need to be administer swiftly fairly and with compassion sincerely hope that the minister will reflect on those experience and that lesson can be learn to ensure that those affect can get speedy resolution and be treat with the dignity and respect they deserve congratulate my hon friend the member for stafford theo clarke on secure the debate we have already hear from the first two speaker how people life have be impact by this scheme many of we right across staffordshire be delighted when we hear the news back in october that the prime minister have take the right decision in cancel phase of many of we have be campaign for that and we be so delighted to hear the news have already spend million on the purchase of land for phase alone and that be even before the major construction work be to start there be hope and belief that the land that have be purchase would be return to the owner and it would all be resolve incredibly quickly be afraid to say however that even though the announcement be make in october there remain an enormous amount of uncertainty an enormous amount of concern and total lack of clarity for many people who be impact by the scheme as the new year begin we need clarity on when land will be return we need to have an understanding of when the selling of land by be to start we need to have an understanding about those people who have have their home take from they when will they be in position to buy back their home when will they be in position to know what the rule be and what their future may hold appreciate that the minister have just today lift the safeguarding on phase think all of we very much welcome that but it still leave many question that need urgent clarity understand that the department for transport have say that the return of land will take time because the department for transport need to make sure the programme provide value for money for taxpayer and do not disrupt local property market it also say there remain significant amount of work to do be sure there be significant amount of work to do but there have be considerable period of time to do that work and people life be on hold and their nerve have be fray many people just do not know what their future hold they can not move on until the minister and give they the certainty and the clarity that be require want to touch on couple of example that have be send to there be sadly lot of fear among many staffordshire resident about how act it act sometimes in quite an imperious manner without necessarily the care consideration or consistency that one would hope for from government own organisation one example relate to farming business temporary possession start in with take around acre for environmental mitigation the family object to the land be take on temporary basis as they do not want to be responsible for the future maintenance of all the thing that be be put on it far graze land of approximately acre be take under temporary possession in january proportion of that land be purchase in july meanwhile preparation for the diversion of high pressure gas main begin in march fencing be erect hundred of metre of hedge be rip out and compound be build before work be halt in may follow the announcement of phase cancellation the family expect the compulsory purchase order to be cancel and the land to be return however further land be purchase in november last time check november definitely come after october so that be after the prime minister announce that the scheme be not continue what be the impact on these farmer they be considerable because have very different understanding of the concept of the purchase of land if any of we in this place or any of our constituent want to purchase land usually we enter into an agreement then we pay money and after we have pay the money we may get the land it work very differently for it can purchase land and never pay for the land those affect then have the problem of have to work around which will never actually build anything on the land here we have business farm with cow dairy unit because of all the infrastructure change that have make such as remove access to part of the graze area it be difficult for the farmer to move livestock around it be difficult for they to gain access to land for which they have never be pay or of which have take temporary possession all this be create an additional workload and they have not be compensate and be not clear about when that will happen another example be small nursery business whose owner depend on people know where it be which have place charge on the land through the land registry will not allow they to cut the hedge that it now own but have never pay for but it be willing to charge they at an incredibly high rate for the freedom to cut the hedge so that people know where their business be this be not the way in which we expect government own company company own not by some national but by the secretary of state for transport to be able to proceed wonder whether if pass on the contact detail of those two business and other detailed information the minister will ensure that their case be examine closely and that resolution be find so many message have be send to about the manner in which have conduct itself about the delay that people have have to suffer about the uncertainty and about people have to put their hand in their own pocket and spend ten of thousand of pound on land agent and consultant to try to get some money back from but still not receive anything so many people have have land take from they land that they no long own but for which they have never receive single penny we need to have clarity we can not wait month and month more hope that the minister who know be diligent and caring minister will give that clarity today or at the very minimum give clear timeline for when everyone who have be impact by will know the rule by which it be play and ensure that there be fairness for the people in staffordshire who have be affect commend the hon member for stafford theo clarke for secure this debate the motion state that this house call on the government to provide compensation to people who have be affect by the construction of take bit of exception to the word construction there have be great deal of cost and great deal of injury especially for the taxpayer in my constituency mile of which have be affect by blight for more than decade there be certainly plenty of injury and need for compensation but there have never be any actual construction as the house know the second project of the high speed rail system be initiate by the labour government before the election think it be lord adonis little pet project which he formulate on the back of fag packet as gimmick for the labour manifesto but unfortunately george osborne pick it up and run with it do the hon gentleman know that before lord adonis get his grubby hand on it design for be make by arup would have connect with and would have go into major transport hub such as birmingham new street and manchester piccadilly it would have be possible to travel directly from manchester piccadilly to france without any change at all and do you know what it would have be cheap as well because there would have be no tunnelling through the chilterns if we be to debate the many failing of we would need more than the time available today that will be for another debate and have no doubt that the government have learn lesson as they always do but they will have be very expensive lesson for the taxpayer be the white elephant that get ever big on taxpayer money oppose the project before it even start vote and speak against it at every opportunity for decade but the elephant get ever large my constituent let out collective sigh of relief when phase be finally dispatch today debate be about compensation which be define as an award normally money pay in recognition of loss suffering and injury although my constituency do not see any construction we certainly have plenty of loss suffering and injury we have year of blight with an area the width of two football field run the whole length of the mile be sterilise countless house be never build and at least one factory at the lounge coal washing site have to be cancel that factory would have create job we have have this blight for year my constituency be fortunate to have the high economic growth in the country but that economic growth and prosperity would have be far great without the blighted land run through the middle of the constituency for more than year what compensation can the minister offer my constituent some of they go to their grave and the big worry in their life be that be suppose to be go through their back garden reassure they that it be never go to happen despite all the bull and bluster from the government it be always go to run out of money when the route be announce in say it be go to end up cost over billion it be in hansard and the house laugh it be right to laugh because it be not billion be it it be billion at its peak the hon member for lichfield michael fabricant be right that the project be suppose to move people seamlessly around the country as the government could never afford to get into city centre because of its burgeon cost they quickly end up aim to move people from nearly london to nearly birmingham if phase have proceed it would have go to nearly manchester do not know anyone who want to go from nearly london to nearly birmingham but the project have to continue have blight my north west leicestershire constituency but want to talk about one community in particular the village of measham be the most affected settlement on the plan route nowhere south of measham have the number of house and business that would have be disrupt without any mitigation know it be one of the most deprived community in my constituency we have regeneration plan to work with fantastic company call measham land through which desirable new house be go to be build on wasteland in the middle of the village work with the ashby canal trust it be go to fund regeneration project include two aqueduct to bring the canal back to measham with café culture around large basin at the end of the canal system where people could bring their longboat there be go to be huge investment in the village until be announce the route go straight through the middle of the measham land site the regeneration of measham have be delay for year the people of measham have suffer loss and injury but where be the compensation okay the regeneration will now go ahead but it be year late the project would have be complete by now we have see that all along the route not just in my constituency who else have be injure will declare an interest be probably the only member of parliament who have to sell their house to house that buy in it be substantial georgian rectory with outbuilding and acre of ground and be force by judge to sell it under the extreme hardship scheme sell it in to be member of parliament think can deal with myself so employ some consultant to deal with it so that it an arm length transaction they charge it take month and go through the system explain to the government afterwards how have swindle everybody along the line with its property price and will explain to the house how it be do it appear to be transparently fair system but can assure hon and right hon member that it most certainly be not give the psychology behind it everybody along the whole route be present with the same option if want to buy property or someone have to sell their property whether it be land factory or dwelling for various reason they will be offer list of valuer by the valuer will be mainly london estate agent of whom the seller will have no knowledge they may know the name some of the very big estate agency be on the list of valuer but it will be deal with by the london office with which people in the midland or the north be unlikely to have ever have any contact they will be ask to choose one of the valuer to value their property and will choose another which sound pretty transparently fair they will both come to the property land or factory to do an valuation if the valuation be within of each other will say let split the difference and call that the valuation on paper that sound very fair but think about the psychology of it those valuer be the valuer for the whole route they will only ever work for an individual who choose they at random because no seller have any knowledge of they whatsoever it be purely random choice by choose valuer someone have do all they can for they the valuer will get pay their fee from for do the valuation but what the valuer on the list all want to be be the valuer that get choose every time by give the pressure from the burgeon cost of the project and the evidence give by whistleblower who have leave the land procurement side of which of the valuer do hon and right hon member think will choose on the next occasion the valuer who put in the high price to buy my house and land from or the valuer who put in the low price for my property and land the fact be that the system use by be always go to drive down the land and property price pay to those affect by the route and it be provable that that be exactly what it do there have be two notable whistleblower who have leave and have speak to both of they over the year former director of doug thornton be put in charge of planning and performance he be later put in charge of billion project to acquire all the land and property that be need along part of the route he go back to and say billion be not enough you can make budget and just say we go to buy all the land and building for billion he say it be near billion but he be tell that he have to buy they for that price do that sound like be ever pay fair price for the property it need to acquire along the route have also recently speak to andrew bruce who be in charge of buy land and property for until he have tell his superior that they have never pay fair market price for any of the land and building that he buy while he be there and he be ask to shred report that he have do on that the two whistleblower suffer loss and injury as well because be tell that they be unable to get another job in the industry after they whistleblew on the practice that they experience in they might need some compensation as well we should protect whistleblower because without they we would still have continuation of the horizon post office scandal maintain that individual and community have be damage by and would be interested to know what compensation the village of measham will get and what we be go to do for every householder and landowner along that route who can prove do not get the right price the minister have promise meeting twice in the last two month and still do not have date for it really hope that he will come through for hope that lesson have be learn by and the government it have be week of scandal horizon post office the loan charge and the government have not cover themselves in glory rise order three members plus the front benchers still wish to speak the debate have to end at urge brevity upon colleague congratulate my hon friend the member for stafford theo clarke on secure this important debate and advocate for her constituent as my remark will show be consider the topic from slightly different but equally important angle be here to press the government to compensate crewe in the light of the cancellation of from birmingham to crewe and then on from crewe to manchester hope that the house will indulge for medical reason be not on the estate when we return from recess follow the announcement by the prime minister regard make my opposition to the decision clear at the time but the decision have now be make so will not spend time rehearse the argument recognise that would be heavily outnumber today on that front will however place on the record the disappointment of my constituent and local business the arrival of to crewe represent fantastic opportunity for the town to secure economic growth and improve connectivity on both inter city and other rail travel crewe have positive future regardless but there be no deny the super charge effect that come to crewe would have have must reluctantly accept the government decision and recognise that other proposal can now move forward as result as part of network north we will see increase funding for most exist major road network and large local major road scheme those scheme can benefit from an uplift in government contribution from to of their cost and increase funding will help to ensure the delivery of the scheme it will also lead to over million to fund new wave of bus service improvement plan in the north and an extra billion to tackle pothole as part of road resurfacing scheme there be no doubt however that as thing stand crewe have not be fairly compensate in the light of the change plan those in local government in cheshire and in cheshire east in particular be encourage to engage with and prepare for arrival have they not be sure they would have be subject to extraordinary pressure from central government to do just that regeneration funding give to the town and in particular our town deal be calculate with clear understanding that this other form of central government investment be happen cheshire east report that it spend over million in prepare for and the crewe hub that include million in the capital programme and million of direct revenue expenditure while it be not for to decide the wisdom of all that expenditure line by line it be significant amount of money predicate on repeat long term commitment from central government that investment be due to realise regeneration in crewe that it will not now achieve that money could have be spend directly in crewe in other way that do secure regeneration of course we can expect our share of the reallocate bus and road funding but that be just the share that we would have expect to get if be never come to crewe decision have be take which the government argue wide region will benefit from but the government need to recognise the financial impact on crewe and step up to the plate do not accept that cheshire east can blame the decision for all its financial woe that be obvious political manoeuvring and it be important that the lion share of any funding go to crewe and be not use just to fill the financial problem face the wide council but do accept that the government must compensate we locally for the implication of their decision we have lot of positive thing to talk about in crewe as mention our town deal be fund million package of project include community centre in the regenerated and reopen flag lane baths brand new home for the south cheshire amateur boxing club new youth club improve pocket park investment in empty shop and more we also have million from the future high street fund however the economic value both direct and associated with be an hub station be of significant scale and the return on bus and road funding will see shortfall that press the government to look at we know number of site get significantly big town deal and levelling up funding have be make available to other place on big scale that be not unreasonable in the context of come to crewe but now it be not know the rail minister be only one part of the puzzle but hope there be recognition across government that movement be need will the minister confirm the government commitment to come forward with proposal to compensate crewe over and above the money all area be receive base on the decision take on and that we expect to receive when will that funding be make available and how when the dust have settle the government should be able to demonstrate clearly that the impact on crewe have be recognise not just with word but with clear investment of funding that be the fair thing to do know the minister recognise the obligation that any reasonable person would see exist and expect he have be press the case but time be move on what we need now be result congratulate my hon friend the member for stafford theo clarke on secure this important debate it give the opportunity have do this many time before in this chamber and at the transport committee to continue to detail the plight face by landowner and small business owner alike who through no fault of their own have be sweep up in the seemingly endless and needless disruption cause by ltd and its contractor in my constituency people face loss and hefty legal bill that have leave many unprofitable some face near bankruptcy and all without the mean to recoup their loss in any equitable way time and again have hear about the inescapable infinite loop of bureaucracy that surround what meagre compensation ltd be willing to cough up which in itself increase and prolong my constituent legal cost one landowner tell that her land agent be increasingly reluctant to take on more work as more and more of his bill which under the act be mean to be compensate by own agent carter jonas go unpaid couple in my constituency have be catch up in this legal quagmire with insistence that their septic tank be replace before the project purchase the property at predetermine rate what be suppose to be relatively straightforward job turn into multi month process prevent my constituent from sell their property at that agree price effectively leave they short change despite they simply follow due process they have yet to be compensate for the difference between the agree value and the actual value of their property in the village quainton which in one way or another have be continuously impact by road closure yet another road closure be about to come into effect this time for two year that will devastate my constituent at doddershall house whose business will suffer from reduce access to and from the estate and require lengthy diversion both for they and their client have not even attempt to offer they compensation for our farmer cattle loss have blight numerous farm as result of poor soil treatment and management by contractor often operate right next door one farm have quote total loss of as direct result of shoddy practice how can this possibly be morally justifiable for the project how can hardworke family be leave with such heavy loss then there be blackleg disease in cattle that be cause by bacteria release from disturb soil be aware of at least one case that the farmer have attribute to malpractice it be noteworthy that farmer in this area have never see blackleg case before in buckinghamshire no prize mr deputy speaker for guess how much compensation have be offer for the avoidance of all doubt it be zero it be not just farmer and landowner who suffer from be leave out in the cold by hundred of road user across my constituency be force to sit in endless congestion wherever decide to cut down tree close whole road in the process and there be endless utility diversion commuter bus take child to school and ambulance respond to life or death situation have all have their journey repeatedly disrupt by with no recourse to any form of compensation whether it be the through waddesdon and fleet marston or the village near wendover such as ellesborough and butlers cross these endless endless diversion be cost real people real money and real time and in some case live on daily basis and there be no compensation that be before we even get to the state of buckinghamshire road destroy by thousand of hgv movement link to construction cause endless damage to car from tyre to suspension system again with its finger in its ear do not take any responsibility for what it have break in buckinghamshire briefly come to business with the example of the prince of wales pub in steeple claydon which sit at the heart of disruption and destruction and be also very near the building of east west rail road in and out of the village be constantly close addison road for example be close for many many month recently it be cost the pub nigh on month in lose revenue at one point the landlord tell that he be down there be no scheme nothing at all to compensate business affect in this way real livelihood and the real viability of business be be challenge put that to former chief executive of ltd mark thurston when he actually bother to visit my constituency in may and the language he use about the pub be unrepeatable in this chamber there be no sympathy he just say that it be just expletive little pub that nobody would want to drink in anyway that be not the attitude that we expect from anyone pay by the state just next door in steeple claydon be langston tasker which stand out among the business affect by construction because as bus and coach operator it be hit hard by any road closure it operate school run take buckinghamshire child to school daily yet the constant road closure the state of the road and the damage to their vehicle be cost the company considerable amount of money every single day which ultimately get pass on to buckinghamshire council and local council tax payer do pay penny towards it no of course not but it absolutely should mr deputy speaker could go on with example like this all afternoon but be very aware of the time and the fact that other wish to speak my message to the minister who know do listen have visit my constituency and do want to get this right be that we must do well ltd must do well the attitude need to change the practice need to change need to understand the real life that it be devastating on daily basis be that people who own property or people who be just try to go about their daily life go to work get the kid to school and perhaps have some fun the people from need to understand the impact that as unwelcome alien in buckinghamshire they be have daily as they build this railway my challenge to the minister be this let we get the compensation that real people my constituent and so many more deserve thank my near neighbour and hon friend the member for stafford theo clarke for introduce this debate we have hear catalogue of problem from various colleague here on both side of the house the sad thing be that they be not unique they be repeat up and down the country when be whip institute system be look at my hon friend the member for rushcliffe ruth edwards who be the whip to see whether this system still operate where we would look at our member of parliament to see how many staff they get through in short period because clearly there be problem if someone could not hold on to their staff for long we would think that the minister or back bencher in question be seriously flaw in some way how many chairman and chief executive have go through it have go through lot because they be flawed in serious way they be dysfunctional that be make even more amazing by the fact that they have go through all these senior staff at and yet it be the highest pay role in the civil service it be extraordinary and it just demonstrate what an organisation this be not only dysfunctional but unfair in an intervention talk about my constituent siân froggatt who be not be allow to reclaim land that be compulsorily take from she even though the land be now not need because the railway be not go ahead on phase might add that she be still wait to be pay wait to be pay and still unable able to reclaim that land take the opportunity of look at my cellphone during the debate not because be look at tractor or anything like that but because be do some research about the crichel down rule it say on the government own website that the crichel down rules require government department to offer back surplus land to the former owner or the former owner successor at the current market value it have to be offer back to the same people not only be it not be offer back at reasonable price but it be often not be offer back to the same people come in at the very last moment to speak in this debate so will not take up great deal of time will listen with interest to the minister response which suspect might be the same as the answer he give yesterday in different debate regard the handsacre junction which happen to be in my constituency ask that in these die day of die day in one way or another the government get grip and ensure that just we ask in the previous debate justice be do for our constituent the sense of justice we have in this nation extend not only to his majesty revenue and customs as in the previous debate but to limited in this one congratulate the hon member for stafford theo clarke on secure

we have hear and those that have be report over the year show the very real consequence of this tory there be some mutter from conservative mp if the civil service and the department for transport be not involve in the decision to cancel that be announce by the prime minister in manchester it be do on the back of fag packet which have be use today all day it be no wonder that we get this type of fiasco we have hear of people have to leave the family home that they work hard for business have to pack up and leave their premise town and village see home target after they be buy and later leave to rot and farmer be force to move or unable to use their land for year because of more and more delay to we have hear of cash strap council such as cheshire east council which the hon member for crewe and nantwich tell we pay out million commend the labour spokesman connor naismith on his campaign to have the council reimburse for the money lose community have have their future put on pause for year and family have find get compensation to be painful and draw out experience life and business have be disrupt for decade and for what staggering billion high speed train line that will now not even reach the community that have be impact train line that accord to the chair of will result in few seat and long journey for those travel north of birmingham what result for the people live in those community and across the north all that be even before we consider how much taxpayer money have be spend on the compensation accord to report almost million have be spend buy up property on the western leg from birmingham to manchester and million spend buy blighted property on the eastern leg to leeds today come the news that the government be lift safeguarding on the land not content with cancel high speed rail to the north the prime minister have now decide to salt the earth if we be not aware already that must be the final nail in the coffin for levelling up can the hon gentleman clarify whether in the unfortunate and unlikely event of labour government they would reimpose safeguarding on phase like napoleon out of moscow it be rout through the poison earth strategy with the lifting of the safeguarding today we have to be responsible we will have to see what the book tell we if we be to enter government in the week or month to come we have see year of promise to the north and the midland break in the prime minister desperate fail attempt to rebrand himself as the change candidate at the next election he decide to rush through an alternative plan at the party conference plan that mention place such as crewe which as the hon member for crewe and nantwich rightly say would have greatly benefit but plan that the prime minister admit be only illustrative illustrative the network north plan announce fantastic news for my wythenshawe and sale east constituency new metrolink line to manchester airport it open in that illustrate the chaos and the confusion of that announcement the now foreign secretary be not alone on the conservative side in criticise the decision two former chancellors warn the prime minister that his action be huge economic self harm while the tory mayor of the west midlands describe it as cancel the great line if may say so to the hon member for lichfield in what be consistent theme for this government this whole mess have be create by not consult the community affect not speak to our metro mayors and not listen to the business across the country that be depend on the project after year community have have enough of the broken promise from this broken government labour will not repeat those mistake mismanage major project turn people live upside down take their trust for grant impact their business and livelihood and fail to deliver be listen carefully to the shadow minister who be tell we that mythical future labour government would not disrupt people life do he understand that build do devastate people life big infrastructure devastate people life and there be no way to do it without do that that be exactly why labour would do it with the mayors with the community and in consultation with those it would affect and impact be go to go under my back garden that be my interest the hon gentleman just say that labour would do it just to be clear can confirm that labour be now say it will bring back if it win the next election refer to the answer give to the right hon member for south staffordshire that remain our position labour have launch an independent expert review of transport infrastructure head by industry leader jürgen maier originally of siemens to learn the lesson from this shamble and to ensure that we deliver transport infrastructure fast and more effectively so that community be not take for ride with nothing to show for it as have be the case here in this debate we have hear just few of the many example of people life be impact by this conservative scandal it be clear that community be still pay the price for the delay of the past decade and the chaos of the past few month the hon gentleman be be very generous in give way would he generously accept that if it have not be for lord adonis change the original plan would have go nowhere near area such as the chilterns it would have go up completely different route and be connected railway and would probably have be quite worthwhile thank the hon member for his intervention but seriously after year those type of excuse be wear extraordinarily thin if he do not mind my saying so hope the minister will outline what be be do to address this chaos cost be still go up after the decision in october to ensure that those impact receive the compensation that they deserve as member have well underline and that the same mistake be not make again and again in future look forward to hear the minister remark once again thank the hon member for stafford for secure the debate and all member who have participate commend my hon friend the member for stafford theo clarke for secure this important debate and acknowledge all contribution from right hon and hon member will come to they in the course of my response as the house will be aware the government lay write ministerial statement this morning announce the lifting of safeguard direction along the former route between the west midland and crewe by lift safeguarding the government be provide certainty to people along the former route of phase and make development easy as ltd will no long object to propose development in the area to which the safeguarding direction have apply to be clear however the lifting of safeguarding do not in any way trigger the start of sell off of property already acquire by the secretary of state no land own by the secretary of state will be sell off until we be ready safeguard apply to land own privately the imposition of safeguard on phase have hitherto protect from conflict development from any private landowner safeguarding have now be lift from phase with one notable exception the continued safeguarding of land close to the village of handsacre north of lichfield in staffordshire that junction which know be dear to my hon friend the member for stafford and indeed to the constituency mp my hon friend the member for lichfield michael fabricant be now an even more critical part of the infrastructure it will allow train to join the west coast main line through connection to the exist rail network can confirm that the government remain committed to deliver the handsacre connection as we be commit to deliver phase from london to the midland mile of new railway be be build by thousand of engineer and construction worker at active construction site at euston we be work with our development partner lendlease to model an ambitious redevelop euston quarter and deliver thousand of home and office that will provide the financing for train into central london today important announcement be further evidence that we be listen to business and resident along the former phase route and we will continue to do so let give the further information that my right hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir gavin williamson and my hon friend the member for lichfield request we will amend the safeguarding on the remainder of the phase route of from crewe to manchester and from the west midland to leeds by the summer to allow for any safeguarding need for northern powerhouse rail to respond to the point make by my right hon friend we will shortly design programme for the disposing of any property that be no long need by and will set out more detail soon can confirm that any land and property that be acquire for compulsorily or via statutory blight but be no long require will be sell subject to the crichel down rule those rule as my hon friend the member for lichfield set out require government departments under certain circumstance to offer back surplus land and property for sale to the former owner or their successor at the current market value therefore assure my hon friend that we be ensure that property be offer back at fair price to original owner with first refusal the minister say that the property acquire by that be no long require will be sell at the current market price but do he accept that as have explain to the house do not pay fair market price at the time of the acquisition of those asset be due to meet the hon member he say that have decline to meet he after two request actually have meeting in his diary yesterday but accord to his office he be unable to make that meeting we have set another date for january will talk to the hon member about the matter he raise the department and the team have look at they before and do not agree with the conclusion he have mention but we will discuss those matter when we meet on the as have be set out by my hon friend and other member who have speak property owner who have find themselves oblige to deal with ltd and its contractor have have vary and at time inconsistent experience those property owner be understandably less interested in what can or can not deliver for transport and the wide economy their focus have instead be on seek the compensation they be entitle to and navigate what must at time have seem like an unequal relationship with readily acknowledge how important it be that those owe compensation such as money for the purchase of their property or expense or cost associate with such transaction be pay in as timely manner as be possible have always seek to impress on the company and its agent that it be unacceptable that case should drag on that be of no benefit to anyone certainly not the property owner and certainly not the taxpayer when it come to pay owner for title to property that they have in many case sell unwillingly it be only right that those owner should receive recompense in full and as fast as be practicable that say each property transaction be unique so present its own set of circumstance as many in this house will be aware when negotiate and settle compensation claim ltd follow the principle set out in the compensation code there be also number of discretionary scheme that offer further help to those not eligible under the statutory framework in effect they go above and beyond that framework ltd must achieve careful balance between meet the need of the claimant and deliver value for money to the taxpayer the compensation code require claimant to provide robust evidence for their claim it be often when claimant be struggle to provide sufficient suitable evidence for their claim that negotiation become frustrated lead to delay will be frank the extent to which claimant agent provide suitable evidence or be willing to negotiate from realistic standpoint vary considerably have find myself in the middle of some discussion of that type in constituent home it be important to understand that background as it help to explain why in some instance property owner consider that they be have payment withhold when late payment do occur they be never acceptable but our datum show that they be the exception rather than the rule property case should be conclude as soon as be practicable within the constraint impose by the balance of the property owner interest and those of the taxpayer the evidence show will happily write to every right hon and hon member who have take part in this debate that ltd be succeed in close down claim despite the considerable complexity that those claim involve however acknowledge that there be number of impact party with whom ltd have not yet be able to reach agreement and negotiation have become challenging and we have hear about many of they this afternoon as mention have get myself involve in many of those case to move they far along and challenge as to the position take my hon friend the member for stafford be tireless advocate for the case that have arise in her constituency some of which she and have previously discuss as she mention she have cite some particular case during the debate will write back to she with my late understanding of where matter sit regard her constituent mr and mrs tabernor and mr collier the same apply to other constituent case name in this debate by my right hon friend the member for south staffordshire and other with regard to the point about intimidation say this as someone who chair the transport select committee believe that everyone should be able to give clear frank open and transparent evidence without fear or favour if there be any evidence of intimidation will of course look at it and make sure that it be eradicate give everyone in the house that assurance as my hon friend the member for buckingham greg smith have demand be determined that ltd should continue to up its game in deal with difficult and disputed case such as the one that have be mention today and other that be aware of let touch on few matter raise by other hon member we have hear from but have not mention the hon member for chesham and amersham sarah green reference number of case be very happy to meet she as have previously she be tireless advocate on her constituent behalf and will meet she again to discuss some of those case have touch on the point make by the hon member for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen and look forward to meet he and go through the point he make in the debate my hon friend the member for crewe and nantwich dr mullan have be tireless advocate of the benefit that could deliver to his constituency and it be the one part of the country that believe need particular mention spend morning with he and local cheshire east councillor look at the potential and at what the team have bring it will not have escape his attention that the local government minister the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend the member for north dorset simon hoare have enter the chamber the two of we speak early this week about the need of crewe and we also speak to other colleague he have be tireless champion of the council with the predicament that it find itself in and when and the local government minister meet the team from cheshire east my hon friend be certainly welcome to join we we have make such point to other colleague and we be determined to help and to work together know that the local government minister care about these matter and will work with we to do so say gently to the hon member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane he be fellow football player with as well as good friend that the labour position appear to keep change just last week the leader of the opposition go to manchester to say that would no long continue which be slightly inconsistent with what we hear this afternoon it may well be the case that many dispute the plan we have in place but the plan be not to go ahead with north of handsacre and instead to spend that money the billion on project across the country particularly to benefit all city across the north and the midland that be the plan but think we would all like to know what labour plan be be it go to deliver if it be not go to deliver beyond the midland be it go to commit to the billion that this government be commit to level up think we would all like that clarity not least the constituent represent by all those sit behind will the minister give way can not because of the time by the look on your face mr deputy speaker let end with three final point first thank my hon friend

accept my hon friend kind invitation to visit stafford will do so and before the spring be out thirdly and in conclusion commit to do the good that can for property owner impact by which include ensure the timely payment of compensation the urgency of which have be lay bare in this debate first thank the minister for listen to the extraordinary example we have hear this afternoon of how have behave to our constituent thank in particular my hon friend the member for lichfield michael fabricant the hon member for chesham and amersham sarah green my right hon friend the member for south

this debate welcome what the minister have say that he will visit my constituency to meet affected resident and in particular that he will write to all of we who have speak in the debate to provide clear answer on the individual case we have raise it be very clear from this debate that there be still considerable uncertainty over and welcome the fact that the government be go to look again at resolve all outstanding compensation claim question put and agree to resolve that this house call on the government to provide compensation to people who have be affect by the construction of petition morecambe town council the petitioner of morecambe on behalf of response which be over quarter of the household of morecambe request the house to take into consideration their petition against morecambe town council precept rise of for to create without full referendum slush fund of million which have be put to one side this amount should be return by any mean possible to the constituent of morecambe either in the form of complete freeze in future council tax until it be pay back or by any other mechanism that this house can employ to meet that objective follow be the full text of the petition the petition of resident of the united kingdom declare that the petitioner do not agree with the increase in the parish precept implement by morecambe town council the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to review the increase in the parish precept implement by the council and cap parish council from be able to implement large rise in council tax without formal referendum in the future and the petitioner remain etc sandwell metropolitan borough council motion make and question propose that this house do now edwards be very grateful for the opportunity the house have give to bring forward this debate all can say be here we go again sandwell metropolitan borough council back on the floor of the house before turn to my broad critique do want to talk about the positive because there be positive news about sandwell despite the line parrot by the fail labour administration in sandwell about this million it have magicke up that it do not have in fact the government have help sandwell with nearly million of investment since enable the community that form the six town in sandwell to realise their potential and opportunity we have see that in million worth of town deal with million for tipton town centre in my constituency million announce for wednesbury friar park and some million on heritage action zone in wednesbury town centre however the focus of the debate be the governance of sandwell and in particular the governance around such scheme at time share the frustration of my constituent who be not see the council spend the capital investment that be come through that beg the question of why surely it be in the council interest to get this off the ground and to spend the investment now and to see the economic and social benefit for our town come to fruition share the frustration of my constituent over the governance of these programme because that simply be not happen that be damn indictment of fail administration want to touch briefly on the community have be very critical of the council in my time in this place and rightly so it be often refer to out there as bent labour sandwell soviet sandwell or the socialist republic of sandwell but despite the failing of the crackpot labour administration the community that represent have real heart and this have build real sense of community campaign we have see that come to fruition often when fight back against the bizarre governance of sandwell for instance through our successful campaign to save walker grange care home in tipton in my constituency labour lead sandwell council argue that it be go to turf out the resident whose age range from up to because it could not afford the cost when our action force transparency on that we find that sandwell have underspent its budget by million again when we put sandwell under scrutiny we find that we can not trust the answer we get back from it the spirit of community campaigning be also show through the community lead campaign that save tipton police station that be obviously not under the direct control of sandwell council but it be interesting to see the sandwell labour leadership rubbish the campaign that the community have lead alongside myself and other and it be even more interesting that our police and crime commissioner attempt to rubbish that campaign he be the same pcc who be use public fund to try to launch judicial review against the government decision to merge the mayor and the pcc hope my hon friend the minister will relay to colleague that it would be good if when the pcc lose that case he be make to refund out of his personal fund the money he have waste on this ridiculous court action let we turn to the heart of this debate which be sandwell metropolitan borough council and the stuff it have do could talk about litany of thing could talk about the special educational need transport contract that go from have provider down to two million contract dole out to friend of the disgrace former labour leader when parent challenge the council on that they be tell shut up or you will lose your transport they be tell that if they criticise the council on social medium their child some of the most vulnerable in the borough would not be able to access the education that they need we then have the disgraceful situation some month ago of clause be put in social tenant contract say that if they criticise the council on social medium they could face disciplinary action up to eviction it would be parody if it be not true it be the socialist nightmare we have see once again that child social service require improvement that be an improvement from inadequate have to ask the comrade at sandwell metropolitan borough council why they think that kid in my constituency do not deserve the same life chance as everyone else to their failure in this space be indicative of the disdain they clearly have for the community they represent could talk about the failure on housing have be work recently as many colleague have on rogue developer we have an incident recently with two estate in my constituency where the council in deal with relatively new untested developer decide not to follow its usual course of use advance payment code in other word get bond ahead of time so that be the developer to go bankrupt the council could access capital fund to do such thing as pave the road and sort out the lighting the council decide for some unexplained reason not to do that when challenge officer at the cabinet petition committee they could not say why they have not do that the political leadership of the council simply say other borough do do it so why would we there be complete and utter lack of accountability from these people and they have complete disdain for the community they represent must touch on the waste contract and the campaign have launch to keep our weekly bin collection sandwell council have enter into million year contract yes that be right for bin collection the council proposal be to take collection fortnightly predicate on the basis that it would somehow save money but it be tie into this contract when it have sign on the dotted line for year struggle to see how that move would save any money as part of that we see strike last year run by sandwell labour paymaster in the gmb that see fly picket and aggressive tactic that be only stop because the community effectively rise up counter picket and counter protested and show sandwell labour paymaster that they be not go to tolerate this anymore because why should they all they see be rise taxis fail service and fall standard the retort we hear from the labour administration in sandwell be that the situation be due to year of the tories and tory cut that be the line labour constantly like to use be sure that my hon friend the minister hear that often from labour colleague in local government simply say this in response the labour party have lead sandwell council for year half century under government of all persuasion and all colour yet people life have get bad if you want to know why your kid can not access decent school do not look here ask sandwell labour if you want to know why your street be not safe at night ask sandwell labour why it be close your police station if you want to know why you can not get your rubbish collect ask sandwell labour if you want to know why the service you pay for be not adequate ask sandwell labour it have have the cash the investment and the resource the point be that it can not be trust to run service in our community properly this issue come to head in march with the intervention by my right hon friend the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities he make the right decision to call in the commissioner there have be progress since and have be please recently by the engagement of my hon friend the minister he have take real interest in sandwell he be to be commend on how he have pick up this interesting brief quickly and fully especially when there be council like sandwell it be such an indictment of year of failure that we be still the eighth most deprived borough in the country it be as if the labour party in sandwell take pride in that it take pride in the fact that standard be drop and it offer no reason for that or alternative on how to fix it it seem to revel in it it blow my mind how anyone in position of authority particularly elect authority could do that when they have stewardship over the great community of the black country as say in my maiden speech these people be grafter and fighter they deserve so much well than this shamble yet time and again we see these people who claim to be representative of work people that be the big joke that any of we have ever hear somehow revel in the fact that standard be fall and thing be not as they seem my hon friend have fantastic set of community in his constituency as do in wolverhampton north east we share similar problem in the black country wolverhampton have similarly have year of labour administration that like to blame conservative government for their failure but when an authority be the bad in something and every other authority be under the same conservative government ultimately it be time to take responsibility do my hon friend share my concern that although ten of million of pound of investment be come into our constituency from this caring level up conservative government we be not see the result and our constituent be not feel the benefit secure million of high street regeneration funding for wednesfield he know it well and have visit it with but nearly three year later my labour council have not put forward plan on paper be sure that he have similar instance my hon friend be absolutely right she be doughty champion for the people of wednesfield bushbury and the rest of her constituency think she share the concern that it feel like there be some run down of the clock it feel like the officer can see the clock tick and do not want recognition to be give to anywhere else will say that particularly since new face have appear among the officer at sandwell council it seem to be more on top of this but there be still the concern that the political leadership of these authority see some sort of win from these thing not materialise it be absolutely crazy as say half billion pound have be put into my borough and yet the narrative seem to be about tory cut be sure it be the same in the great city of wolverhampton the narrative will be it year of the tories but it be not it be year of labour turn its back on these community have solution for my hon friend the minister which be coin in the campaign that have be launch with such enthusiasm scrap sandwell sandwell be an artificial construction of the ted heath reform of the which bring together six very different town in the black country appreciate that he will not be able to stand at the dispatch box today and say yes to that much as would be over the moon for he to do so there be always middle ground in how we empower our community but the truth be that sandwell metropolitan borough council and its political leadership in particular have bring embarrassment to the community represent the retort that have have particularly from labour politician have be well you talk the area down no in the campaign that we launch in october we have thousand of response and of they say they do not recognise themselves as come from sandwell if you come from wednesbury you come from wednesbury if you be from tipton you be from tipton if you be from ocker hill you be from ocker hill if you be from great bridge you be from great bridge if you be from smethwick you be from smethwick you be not from sandwell what be sandwell sandwell be the name of the franciscan priory from year ago it be not place well it be place but it be construct place people be proud of their town be proud that live in wednesbury and be proud of that town mention in the domesday book year ago that be what people want to see of course the real life impact be that my town in tipton and wednesbury have miss out because sandwell council priority have be in west bromwich and smethwick all because the arbitrary threshold have not be meet because of the size of those town clearly there be option to be explore and appreciate that we can utilise many mechanism to ensure that the identity of these community be respect accentuate and bring to the fore that be so important to my constituent they be proud of where they come from and the heritage of their town they be feed up with this creation that have turn into monster leave they without service we have have the ridiculous situation today where all the pay and display parking machine have be take out of the car park in spring head in wednesbury the council expect people to go online not realise that most of the demographic who utilise that service be of an age where they be probably not digitally connected talk about governance that be the kind of lunacy and idiotic idea that come from that rabble yet they sit there and lord it as if they have be hard do by we need proactive government in our town whether through an empower town council there be example of that in the west midland or through some other format we need something that will safeguard our identity and local government structure that preserve and look after the identity of my proud town of tipton and wednesbury it be as simple as that be look forward to the minister visit to the black country and be sure he will visit my hon friend the member for wolverhampton north east jane stevenson on the way our proud black country town have so much to offer the governance at sandwell metropolitan borough council have do nothing but bring embarrassment to those town it be not talk down those community to highlight that it be not talk down the community to highlight that labour party that have govern that area for year have be to the detriment of people who have see their service cut and their opportunity eradicate but their aspiration have not be cut because the people represent be aspirational they want to achieve but they be block time and again by the labour administration wish to finalise my remark with quotation from history which hope the minister will appreciate as prepare my comment be look for something to sum up my thought on the governance situation at sandwell metropolitan borough council be sure that those who have study it will know where it come from but when long train of abuse and usurpation pursue invariably the same object evince design to reduce they under absolute despotism it be their right it be their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security my hon friend probably know where that come from the declaration of independence the security and the safeguarding of the future of these proud town be at the heart of what be here to do they have have half century of disservice by the shambolic labour rabble who have do nothing but try to eradicate their life chance and leave they bad off that should never be the case look forward to hear from my hon friend the minister be so grateful for the time and effort he have put into sandwell he be committed to make sure we get this right thank my hon friend the member for wolverhampton north east for her consider intervention thank the house and you mr deputy speaker for hear my comment make my constituent promise when be elect to this place that after year of feeling ignore they would never be ignore again hope that in this speech have make sure that their voice be hear loud and clear first thank my hon friend the member for west bromwich west shaun bailey for secure this debate have be in this job for nine week if have fiver for every time he have stop in the lobby or in the corridor to raise an issue or have conversation about his borough council it would certainly have buy he and quite good dinner he never miss an opportunity and he be right to do so we use the phrase doughty champion quite lot to describe colleague he truly be one and his constituent should be proud and pleased with the passion concern and care with which he advocate so vociferously on their behalf not just to but to my right hon friend the secretary of state and to ministers across government he be to be warmly commend for all he do on behalf of his resident my hon friend be right to talk in the first instance about money will just set the scene if may sandwell reserve stand as of march somewhere in the region of million that be very good that speak to sensible management and ensure that fund be available for rainy day the provisional local government finance settlement make available million for his council an increase in core spending power of million or increase in cash term when compare to therefore share his belief that to say that all the council problem be root in the heartlessness and lack of thought or attention from this government be scotch just by those figure however my hon friend be right to go on to talk about the other important investment that have be make in his borough by the government million from the town fund million from the levelling up partnership million from the levelling up fund round million from the levelling up fund round and million for capital regeneration project those be important figure and important project of themselves but when add together nobody could suggest that this be party and government who do not care for the people of sandwell and be not seek to do all they can work alongside elect member be they local councillor or members of parliament to help drive that figure of eighth most deprived borough in england into far well place do not think that argument stand up to challenge what would say to my hon friend and know he will agree with in this assessment be that he be right to talk about the potential downside he manifest some of they in his remark when any one political party dominate the political scene and the landscape for considerable period of time hope that what his election have demonstrate and that of other hon friend represent constituency in the area be that we believe that level up be all about aspiration and ambition for all that no part of our country be leave behind and that there be no one who do not deserve our attention our help and our support be very pleased and proud to serve in department in this government that have spend so much money time and effort consider the need of sandwell metropolitan borough council we have proud record on which we stand and be sure that many people in my hon friend constituency recognise that all too well before we look to the present and the future we have to look slightly to the past commissioner have to go into the council because as it recognise itself there be serious governance issue and problem with culture and leadership they include allegation of serious misconduct by both councillor and officer the council have have six different leader in six year that make it feel bit like this place mr deputy speaker and three chief executive over the previous three year that instability lead to breakdown in trust respect and confidence between those hold governance role at the council on service the time the authority spend respond to internal allegation and complaint impact on its ability to focus on service improvement inadequate procurement and contract management arrangement lead to poor decision making and impact negatively on key service include transport for child and those with special educational need it be those trigger that prompt my right hon friend the secretary of state to send in the cavalry he be right to do so and know that my hon friend applaud my right hon friend for the action he take that action have work and want to pay tribute to the current leadership of sandwell metropolitan borough council be they get everything right no but there again must share secret with my hon friend neither do ministers all the time we be all human to err be human to forgive as we know be divine however significant improvement have be make which have allow the commissioner to continue to refer in their publish report to the department to clear trajectory of improvement that mean not just improvement in the output of service to those who be most in need but significant step change in the way in which the council have order and organise itself and its approach to governance sometimes admit when one be wrong and face the problem be the big challenge and once that be overcome the route to recovery appear clear it be not without stumble block and stone and it will not be without pause along the way but the council leader have make significant progress and as say they should be both congratulate and encourage when the position of the commissioner cease and we will be look to that in due course the local government association will continue to work with the council to ensure that that path of progress that path of improvement which be hopeful and confident that local resident have start to see or will soon start to see be continue fall back into the old way of performance or lack of performance will not be tolerate it will come as no surprise and say this not as threat but as statement of fact that as with any authority that have find itself in position whereby commissioner have have to be send in progress have be make and the work of those commissioner can be draw to conclusion within the envisaged timetable we will keep weather eye kindly eye if you will the eye of paternal godfather on council that be still try to do its good we will continue to be there to support advise and encourage because the depth of the change that the council need to be make will by definition necessitate that my hon friend talk of the abolition of sandwell council he will not be surprised to know that be about to repeat the dictum of the government we will of course always respond to any reorganisation of local government but that must be from the grassroot up support must be demonstrate at political level and community level from the business community and from other public service provider and clear case must be make have to say hope this give some clarity to my hon friend although appreciate that it may not be the clarity he seek but also hope it give both certainty to the council and an indication to the resident the council taxpayer and more important the user of its service of the improvement it have make that fear that change in the architecture of the borough at this stage would prove distraction from the vital improvement work that be ongoing of course there be way to improve scrutiny and of course there be way through the localism agenda to empower the town particularly those historic town where there be great sense of place and identity however suggest to my hon friend that he should work with the council leadership to explore those opportunity to give much great sense of place to the town with which those who live in they feel such close affinity we be make huge investment in sandwell metropolitan borough council in monetary term and in term of time and energy why do we do this we do it because we care and because we understand the important role that local government play in the fabric of our nation the powerful role that it play in create sense of place and deliver change respond to the change need of the most vulnerable and those who seek to improve on the agenda of hope and aspiration for change with my hon friend and other colleague with an engaged council that have new and improved outlook have every confidence that all of we pull together can deliver for the people of sandwell question put and agree to house adjourn
