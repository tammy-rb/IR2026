that be just the intervention that need there have also be the case of jodey whiting david wood and many many other our report recognise the significance of every death and harm experience by claimant and the impact of these case on their love one we know that death and serious harm of claimant be investigate by the department in alone as part of its internal process review but in common with the national audit office report we believe that the actual number be much high we hear evidence that the process of access dwp support and some dwp policy themselves can create or exacerbate exist vulnerability for example sanction or the threat of sanction can lead to material deprivation stress and the deterioration of physical and mental health in some case the experience of engage with the system and the process have be so difficult and distressing that it have contribute to claimant decide to take their own life some of the most serious case of harm where coroner inquest have find that dwp contribute to claimant death have result in prevention of future death report since dwp have be issue with prevention of future death report relate specifically to the death of benefit claimant the fact that the equality and human rights commission issue section notice on the dwp for potential discrimination against disabled people in and the investigation that be subsequently launch last year after the failure to reach an agreement add to the evidence that the work and pensions committee collect on the dwp inadequate approach to safeguarding the inquiry set out to examine the support that the department provide to vulnerable claimant how it have learn from mistake and failure and what need to change the new committee agree to reopen the inquiry on october before turn to the finding and recommendation of the report should acknowledge that in the pathway to work green paper publish in march the government say they be consult on new dwp safeguarding approach to make it clear what the department and its staff be expect to do in order to safeguard the public welcome that and be hearten by the secretary of state evidence to the committee last november our principal recommendation be for statutory safeguarding duty to be place on the dwp to protect claimant although the secretary of state would be accountable for this duty reflect the leadership need to drive these change it would make safeguarding in the dwp everyone business at all level of the organisation and at all stage of policy development and implementation the duty would include the proactive consideration of the safeguarding need of claimant the ability to refer vulnerable individual to other agency with duty of care and again the proactive consideration of the impact of key policy and legislation on the health and wellbeing of claimant before they be implement the need for new legal obligation be clear the current approach to safeguarding in dwp have be describe as piecemeal and lack coherence and the committee agree for that reason the report call for comprehensive system base approach to safeguard that integrate into every stage of policy development implementation and review the approach must involve everyone in the dwp to ensure that safeguarding become fundamental part of the department culture we see new statutory duty as the cornerstone of big cultural shift that be need in the dwp for too long the focus have be on cost cutting often at the expense of provide genuine support that approach have lead to system in which claimant feel undeserving of support and fearful of the very department that be mean to assist they the necessary cultural shift must be drive from the top down with ministers and senior official lead the way statutory safeguarding duty would help to focus mind improve accountability and ensure that safeguarding become everybody business in the dwp the need for deep root cultural change in the department can not be overstate the process of engage with the dwp often lead to mental distress for claimant this distress be compound by lack of trust in the system drive by continual cost cut measure and an unhelpful media narrative to rebuild trust the dwp must prioritise safeguarding and support over cost cutting and this mean create system that not only help people to find sustainable work but compassionately support those who may never work the report also emphasise the importance of learn from past mistake the department have conduct number of ipr but the full scale of harm be much high the ongoing investigation by the equality and human rights commission into the department treatment of disabled people and those with long term mental health condition underscore the need for transparency and accountability in addition to the statutory duty the report make number of other important recommendation which will go through quickly as have mention it be recommend that all significant new policy be analyse by the department chief medical adviser team currently such assessment be not routinely carry out lead to policy that may inadvertently harm claimant or exacerbate exist vulnerability by make these assessment standard part of policy development we hope to ensure that the impact of policy on the health and wellbeing of claimant be consider and harm mitigate the report stress the importance of have robust clear and accessible complaint procedure to prevent failure recur as have state the true scale of death and harm be not know the report call for systematic recording and publication of all case of serious harm and death involve claimant the department should commit to publish this information annually to aid transparency the report also recommend improve transparency in the process use to learn from serious mistake and failure and the introduction of an independent body the department should not mark its own homework to investigate serious harm on define and identify vulnerability the department current approach be see as flexible lack in clarity and consistency the report call for formalise definition of vulnerability that be clearly communicate in public face document it also recommend add victim of abuse to the additional support area in universal credit and implement proactive measure to identify and support vulnerable claimant ensure that vulnerable people can access the benefit they be entitle to be crucial for deliver equitable welfare provision the removal of the help to claim face to face service have make it more difficult for some individual to apply for universal credit the report recommend that the dwp ensure that jobcentre provide thorough support and that detailed information about additional support be proactively offer to claimant in that regard do give praise because there be so many good people in the department such as the advanced customer support senior leader who be integral to help frontline dwp staff praise those staff and we need more of they effective communication and make sure that people be aware of what support they can access be also important and we need more of it that also apply to training and capacity building for frontline staff which need to happen to achieve the cultural change we need finally collaboration with other agency need to be statutory responsibility and there need to be dwp membership of the safeguarding adult board be very grateful to you madam deputy speaker
