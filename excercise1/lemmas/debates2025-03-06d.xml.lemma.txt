our good wish to the prime minister and other european leader in do everything they can to support that country it be now three month or so since become shadow leader of the house and be sad to say that these joyous thursday morning session seem to have fall into little bit of rut interruption no no hear you cry business question be still as fresh lively and engaging as they ever be if not more so but sadly fear that be not true it be our function on the opposition benches to press public concern and raise question about the government indeed as his majesty loyal opposition it be not only our function but our constitutional duty to do so it be the government job to respond to those question and concern and in so do to make the case publicly for the policy choice and decision they have make and to say whether they have an underlying strategy unfortunately as you will have notice mr speaker the government be not do that in our session in fact the leader of the house rarely if ever respond to the important public question and concern that raise instead be sorry to say that we get the same endlessly reheat mishmash of standard party political line personal jibe and irrelevant comment hon member will recall that first raise this issue at business question on december when highlight series of occasion on which the leader have be unwilling to answer or even address some obvious example of government economic incompetence as point out many different response be open to she she could have say agree with you official report december vol she could have say the shadow leader be wrong for the follow reason or even do know if she do not want to respond at that time she could have say as so many other ministers do will look into it will reply to you or will ask colleague to investigate and respond we just hear the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster say those thing in fact on none of those occasion do the leader of the house bother to give any kind of proper answer at all instead her approach be to change the subject and attack the previous government rather than to defend the record of her own government which be after all the whole point of these exchange more troubling still be that she herself have so often call for transparency from ministers and that failure to be accountable be itself breach of the rule of this house of the nolan principle and of the ministerial code of conduct wish could report that anything have change since december if anything however be afraid that matter have get bad recent low point be at business

government seek to take and their attitude towards judicial review be sorry to say that the leader of the house do not bother to respond to any of those question instead we have yet another series of irrelevant political attack we need well way to track and monitor those evasion so in the spirit of openness and transparency propose new approach which we can call leader bingo colleague get point every time the leader of the house blame the previous government attack member of the opposition change the subject or use the word gently remind take no lecture or similar in her response would not for one second suggest that colleague shout bingo in the chamber but there may be other way in which they can indicate when they have fill their card that be light hearted suggestion but it have

wind and deliver the energy security that the country so desperately need be sure that he will delight in read the forthcoming planning and infrastructure bill probably in matter of day zoe dunklin from thrapston in my constituency be former paralympian who represent our country on the global stage recently the publicly fund motability scheme refuse her request for six way driver seat which would have mean that she could use car independently instead the scheme only offer vehicle that would force she to rely on carer to get she in and out thereby prevent she from work and volunteering and take away her independence she have even offer to pay the difference in price in order to get what she need to live independently will the leader of the house join in fight for the independence that zoe and other deserve absolutely my hon friend highlight how important it be to give people independence and mobility so they can go about their life and work as well he will be aware that the motability foundation be an independent charity but the government continue to work with it to ensure that its policy be open and inclusive as they should be as the green party representative on the cross party commission on social care be deeply disappointed at the cancellation with only day notice of last week plan initial talk since social care be in crisis surely it should be matter of urgency to get these talk reschedule but have as yet have no response to my request for new date will the leader of the house ask the secretary of state for health and social care to urgently prioritise set new date for the talk as soon as possible absolutely will do so because these talk be essential we be determined to take forward cross party talk on the future of social care which be so important if the comment from across the atlantic this week have remind we of anything it be that we should always keep at the forefront of our mind the bravery of our service personnel not least in recent conflict in iraq and afghanistan when serve alongside the us and other ally therefore ask my right hon friend to find time on the floor of the house for we to debate the bravery and sacrifice of our service personnel hear hear absolutely my hon friend can hear from the cheer across the house that this would make very popular and important debate it would be reminder that our armed service have go to many country around the world in support of our ally over many year and sacrifice their life and we should always remember their bravery and their contribution assume that the leader of the house share my constituent alarm that court find that convict drug dealer who be here illegally could not be deport because he be too westernised that prolific offender include domestic abuser be as understand it go to be offer anger management course rather than be incarcerate and most of all that the new sentencing guideline suggest that judge should look at felon ethnicity and religion before sentencing will she allow debate on criminal justice to enable we to expose the huge gulf between the liberal bourgeoisie prejudice and those of our constituent who want people catch capture convict and punish regardless of whether they be black brown white or any other colour think the right hon member be talk about deport criminal when they should be deport he will be aware or should be aware that nearly foreign criminal have be deport since the election which be an increase of more than compare with situation under the last government however he be right to point out that there be still gap in that system which be why we have bring in the border security asylum and immigration bill the bill will strengthen power to tackle illegal migration and the small boat and enable the government to pick up the pace even far on return those who have no right to be here in series of hard hit article in the herald and the evening times recently the current condition of my home

suggestion and how do she think the government could support that ambition and the ambition of all of we who have the good interest of glaswegians and glasgow at heart be sure my hon friend can appreciate that as mancunian agree with all of andy burnham suggestion nearly all of the time anyway and this sound like very good one however she make the big point that the scottish government along with the previous conservative government here in westminster have fail the scottish people that be why people vote overwhelmingly for fresh start with labour at the general election and be sure that will continue woman be be force to face significant risk in order to be inclusive man must not be allow access to woman only space regardless of whether they believe themselves to be woman they be not we must prioritise safety over inclusivity dignity over wokery reality over ideology will the leader of the house commit to debate in government time on protect woman only space and woman only service thank the hon gentleman for that question the equality act which be bring in by labour government be absolutely clear on the provision of woman only space and that they be to be protect especially where they be need we be proud to have bring in the act and we stand by it be sure he would have want to say in his question that the labour party have do more to support woman to close the gender gap to reduce inequality and to tackle violence against woman and girl than perhaps his party or the conservative party the postcode in my constituency have experience troubling surge in knife relate offence the west midland violence reduction unit have be instrumental in address the issue engage with over young people and contribute to reduction in youth violence involve knife between april and september however the violence reduction unit depend on short term annual funding which restrict its capacity for long term strategic planning will the leader of the house schedule debate in this chamber to discuss the incredible work of violence reduction unit and explore the long term funding arrangement for these organisation absolutely my hon friend raise really important issue the government be determined to tackle knife crime she be right that this be long term strategy it be about prevention and support organisation like the one she mention and establish organisation such as young futures and the coalition to tackle knife crime which the prime minister bring together as well as take the step we be already take to ban the sale of knife and to pass other measure that be in the forthcoming crime and policing bill she will note that there be debate on this matter in two week time in the chamber last week attend the thrive youth café hold at all saints church in huntingdon the café run on mondays and fridays after school richard and ruth who run the space say that it provide safe space and listening ear as well as pool table tennis and playstation crucially it provide opportunity for young people to access support from local youth worker funding for the thrive youth café be precarious with grant allow the project to exist only in six monthly cycle and it desperately need long term funding guarantee will the leader of the house make time in the schedule to celebrate the value that such provision bring to teenager and young people and can invite she to the youth café to try one of its now infamous oreo milkshake my child be very fond of oreo milkshake and all the calorie that be usually in they will take the hon gentleman up on that offer when be next in huntingdon in his constituency he raise what sound like fantastic volunteer run service in his local community many such service face fund uncertainty which be one reason why the government want multi year funding settlement for local government as that be where many of those type of organisation get their funding from we need to do more to ensure that these important service can thrive and survive blyth town in my constituency be definitely on the up and up but the first impression for new visitor use the main gateway into the town be of huge derelict garage in desperate need of demolition northumberland county council have be approach to address the situation but here be the issue the council say quite simply that while it agree it be in complete and utter mess it do not bring the overall amenity of the area down what slap in the face for the people in the local community do the leader of the house agree that certain area have be abandon over year of tory rule can we

that the justice secretary come to the chamber to explain why under this government sentencing be go to become about who someone be and not what they have do as the hon gentleman know the sentencing guideline be develop and consult on under his government last year and they be not rule out the current justice secretary the remarkable and formidable justice secretary have make her position

to drive the roll out of clean energy project we have improve the offshore wind auction so that later this year there will for the first time be new clean industry bonus to reward investment in good manufacturing job and clean supply chain we have oversee record break renewable auction we have kick start the uk carbon capture and hydrogen industry the energy sector of the future with strong early investment just yesterday we award more than million to the port of cromarty firth for upgrade that will support the development of float offshore wind create hundred of job as we ensure scotland and the uk remain world leader in this next generation technology but that be just the start our clean power action plan will drive billion year of investment to meet our goal of clean power by research show that job in offshore renewable sector could increase by ten of thousand in that time we will also make sure worker have the tool they need to take up these new opportunity already we have work with the scottish government and trade body to launch skill passport make it easy and quick for oil and gas worker to bring their skill and experience into clean energy job that idea have be stick in the mud for year thankfully we have make more progress in the past eight month than be make in the previous year combine at the same time we be put clean energy at the heart of our upcoming modern industrial strategy we be incredibly fortunate to have the north sea on our doorstep for decade the oil and gas bury there have fuel development and charge our economy but the north sea long term future lie in its incredible clean energy potential we know that its stable wind and shallow shelf make it one of the good location in the world for offshore wind farm we know that the uk continental shelf alone have enough capacity to store up to billion tonne of carbon which be roughly the amount this country have produce since the industrial revolution with our skilled offshore industry and workforce we be perfectly place to seize this natural advantage and get ahead in the global race for new job in new industry instead of stick our head in the sand and avoid the big decision we have set out plan to deliver the future that the north sea worker and community deserve it be plan to co ordinate the scale up of clean energy industry from offshore wind and hydrogen to carbon capture and storage plan to give the oil and gas sector the support and clarity it need to continue operate for decade to come plan for energy security and sustainable economic growth and plan to keep work with the people who matter most the north sea business worker community and trade union to take advantage of the tremendous opportunity of the year ahead together commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of her statement another day another demonstration of this government total ignorance of our oil and gas industry and the north east of scotland their incompetence on the economy and their disregard for the hundred of thousand of worker in our north sea as well as their dangerous ineptitude when it come to our energy security no other country in the world especially at time of heighten global instability and volatility would actively choose to aggressively and at pace shut down its domestic oil and gas industry but that be exactly what this government and in particular this department lead by the eco warrior in chief be do the consultation announce yesterday be trumpet by government spinner as the beginning of the end of the energy profit levy and brave new dawn for the north sea it be complete and utter rubbish it be total joke the energy profit levy be high now than it be before because of the decision of this labour government the investment allowance have almost all be scrap by this labour government crucially the windfall tax be now in place for far long until because of this labour government that be five year away but the oil and gas industry do not have five year investment be dry up and work be be put on pause company be literally shut up shop the truth be that the high pay good long term job that the minister speak of do not yet exist in renewable in the north east of scotland people be leave in their drove for other country such as the usa saudi arabia the uae qatar and norway where the industry do have future she say we owe it to the north sea worker and community to come up with proper plan for their future but this government plan for the north sea be simply to shut it down this government plan be betrayal of those worker this government plan will devastate the community of the north east of scotland it be say that in every oil produce country in the world you will find an aberdonian it turn out that the only country in which you will not find an aberdonian work in oil in the near future be scotland drive by this mad rush to clean power and the government obsession with renewable at the expense of everything and everyone else it may be drill baby drill in the united states but it be dole baby dole under labour in the united kingdom the government decision will cost our economy some billion in lose tax revenue to the treasury on top of the billion in lose capital investment this make complete mockery of their claim to be anything like pro growth it be insanity to be do all this to our own industry while become increasingly reliant on import from abroad and cause more carbon to be release into the atmosphere more import of liquefy natural gas fracke in the usa frozen and then ship across the atlantic on diesel chug ship or more import from norway net exporter which be drill from the very same sea from which we could drill ourselves it be completely nonsensical this government be complete joke oversee the wilful deindustrialisation of our nation if the minister will not take my word for it perhaps she will take the word of the gmb leader who say in the new geopolitical reality it madness if the north sea be be prematurely close down and we be increase import dependence that bad for job economic growth and national security or perhaps she will take the word of the general secretary of unite who say we need to resist any call that amount to offshore our carbon responsibility for the sake of virtue signal may ask the minister whether she have personally meet any oil and gas worker since take office in order to understand what her government policy mean for they and their family and whether the secretary of state have do so will the industry receive an answer on the uncertainty surround the calculation of scope emission and environmental impact assessment give the announcement of million to support the worker affect by the closure of grangemouth how much do the minister think the treasury might need to find to support the worker currently support by the oil and gas industry do she agree with the climate change committee that we will need oil and gas until at least and have she account for the high carbon emission associate with import liquefy natural gas instead finally let ask whether she still see the department as sponsor and champion for the industry because the industry certainly do not trust that to be the case the shadow minister quote trade union representative have not meet they or support they in government that be always rich interruption he say that he do stand correct although suspect that he do not do it often he quote the general secretary of the gmb so let quote he back the general secretary say tory ideology have leave the uk vulnerable and expose our government stand by and export the bulk of the job close gas storage and fail to invest in new nuclear and skill thank the shadow minister for his question and will come to they shortly but have to say that this be fairly familiar story from the conservative party no acknowledgment of their fail record on the north sea no acknowledgment of their have preside over the bad cost of live crisis in generation and no answer to the future challenge that our country face remind the hon gentleman that it be his party that lose north sea job in less than decade his government be content for those worker to have to go around the world to find job but this government want to keep those talent here in the uk which be why unlike the last government we have plan in my statement say that everyone accept that the north sea be decline basin do not know whether the shadow minister understand the basic geology but this be super mature basin and the hard it become to drill for oil and gas the less likely it be that people will be successful only one in of the licence that have be offer and grant in recent year have ultimately lead to any work the hon gentleman need to establish what his party view of this agenda be the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy who be sit next to he have some very peculiar thing to say in westminster hall yesterday and it be unclear exactly what their position be the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie be minister for the grid who oppose grid infrastructure he be minister for solar who oppose solar power and here he be now the minister for aberdeen campaign against job and investment in his own community we be get on with plan for the future first we will invest in clean power it be ludicrous that at this time when our bill depend on what putin choose to do and we have to respond the shadow minister be suggest that we should do more of that even if there be no climate change even if there be no push to clean power if we drill as much oil and gas from the north sea as we possibly could it would amount to less than of the global market and would have no impact on bill whatsoever we will give immediate support to worker we have explain how we will do that and we will support scotland more widely we will support great british energy in aberdeen we will support grangemouth with million from the national wealth fund harland and wolff in arnish and methil have be save from closure yesterday the port of cromarty firth receive million through the float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme twenty per cent of the contract in allocation round of the contract for difference auction be go to scotland we have hydrogen investment in cromarty and ayrshire we have the big budget for the scottish government that we have see this be party that be commit to support the people of scotland not oversee manage decline call the chair of the select committee the minister be right to remind we that the north sea be mature basin she be right to remind we that job have be lose there in the last year and she be right to praise the highly skilled engineer who have make such contribution in the north sea and to the country she mention the skill passport and say that the government be make progress with the industry in find alternative in the job transition the select committee have hear number of time evidence that one of the challenge be the fact that pay in the north sea be significantly high than pay in equivalent job in the renewable sector and offshore wind in particular what at this stage be the minister thought on how we can make pay more attractive for worker move from oil and gas into renewable thank my hon friend for his work on the select committee which be very important as he know for long time we have be bit stuck in try to set up passport system because of the slightly different skill and qualification in each industry and the need to bring they together the government become involved to try to ensure that we could bridge that gap and enable people to make the transition oil and gas worker be highly skilled and greatly in demand and as my hon friend say they be pay good wage we need to work with the new offshore wind company we like to see union recognition and we like to see good salary for people do those job as well there will be other job that people can go into the plan be to help people make the transition rather than leave they adrift as the last government do call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of her statement much of which we can agree with the north sea give the uk the opportunity to become powerhouse in renewable energy generation and it be time that we seize it we urge the government to make good their commitment to consult on new regime to boost investment in job we want to ensure that the oil and gas industry be wind down in way that support the redeployment of skill and job and provide the right incentive to encourage fossil fuel industry to invest in green technology what detail can the minister give we of the support that the government will provide to upskill and redeploy those who be formerly work in the fossil fuel industry we believe that much bold action be urgently need to ensure energy security to cut bill and with donald trump threaten to pull the united states out of the paris agreement once again to resume the uk global leadership role on climate action which be abandon by the previous conservative government we urge this government to introduce an emergency year plan to insulate home start with free insulation for the most vulnerable resident and to introduce an energy social tariff to tackle fuel poverty and health inequality cause by cold damp home we be deeply concerned about the cost of heating bill follow ofgem decision to increase the energy price cap by this april the third increase since october the government must decouple electricity price from the wholesale gas price and toughen up their windfall tax on the profit of oil and gas giant include by increase the tax by another two percentage point to headline rate of time and again we have be disappoint by the decision that the government have take this winter to delay energy bill support for household for example the government warm home scheme design to insulate home will not benefit household until order there be always maximum of two minute and you have exceed it please be seat thank the hon lady for her remark on upskille and redeploy worker as say previously we be introduce the passporting scheme and make sure that we can break down the barrier that exist in different industry because the skill and talent of people work in oil and gas can be transfer to renewable energy we want to make sure that we do that the hon lady talk about vulnerable resident and the cost of heating and she be absolutely right to do so we have all suffer from the huge cost of living crisis cause by putin invasion of ukraine we be do what we can and million people will now get the warm home discount this winter which will help with their energy bill the hon lady ask about the windfall tax the clue be in the name it be tax on windfall profit while the oil and gas industry be make windfall profit there will be windfall tax when it be not there will not be that be the way the scheme work but her point on the need to insulate home we be work at pace on that and to support vulnerable people be absolutely right the basic principle be that we have an energy bill rise drive by fossil fuel so we must move to home grow power for our energy security and for long term bill reduction rise order if question be not keep short member will prevent their colleague from get in congratulate the minister on set out plan that support job skill and community in the face of technological change unlike the conservative party which abandon wholesale our industrial base in the like the north east of scotland the north east of england have job skill and opportunity that depend on the energy of the north sea kinewell energy in my constituency lead in wind farm design optimisation can the minister confirm that she will work with the mayor of the north east kim mcguiness to ensure that the north east of england benefit from the job and opportunity of the north sea meet industry representative all the time and their response to kim mcguiness be great she be such force of enthusiasm knowledge and power for her community and people engage with she they like what she say about invest in the north east and they be respond to she she be make real difference in her community we be do all we can through all kind of lever that the government can use to make sure that the investment in clean energy support all our community my hon friend be right to highlight the fact that we need to take advantage of the particular skill of people in the north east call the father of the house when climb the hill behind my home in the lincolnshire wold can see mile away wonderful array of wind turbine in the north sea we love it locally we love it for our economy but nothing in that preclude oil and gas exploration if we in lincolnshire be do so much for green energy why be we allow the bread basket of england to be cover with solar farm we have acre of they around gainsborough and there be another application for acre at north clifton will the minister and her boss please look at such mass application in the round so that there be not overdevelopment in the break basket of england the right hon gentleman paint lovely picture of walk up the hill in his constituency be sure we would all enjoy do that he make an important point about solar we need to make sure that we be take people with we and do the right thing which be what we be try to do we know that even if we push as far as we could on solar it would still account for less than of the overall land and the same proportion of our agricultural land it be small amount he be right to want to make sure that his constituent have an environment that they like and enjoy it be equally right to say that we will need infrastructure in our community and that people should see benefit where we ask they to have infrastructure there be the solar taskforce which be look at all these issue it be good to see the government take very sensible approach in the consultation to work with our european partner on how we develop renewable energy and get energy cost down as with so many other area our constituent have pay high bill because the previous government refuse to work with our european counterpart can the minister give we bit more detail as we look to expand our capacity to create renewable energy she will be very aware that there be risk of an million charge because of the variation between our emission trading scheme can she also tell we bit more about what work with the north seas energy co operation might entail and whether we might rejoin that organisation to help drive down bill far for our constituent my hon friend raise number of thorny issue relate to ets for which be responsible in the department we have be have lot of conversation about how we progress what the eu do what we do and what we need to do move forward these thing be enormously complicated because pull lever here will have an unintended consequence over there so we be tread carefully as she would expect on the eu partnership and the new relationship that we have with our partner they be incredibly important today the prime minister be with the taoiseach in ireland and we be agree an energy partnership we will be work together in the celtic sea and the irish sea to speed up progress on wind turbine by use datum and our resource to look at our marine landscape and get to point where private investor can invest quick these thing be worth do and we will certainly carry on do they be in favour of net zero and this country have achieve great deal in work towards that but what planet be the minister department on be she unaware that there be now national security crisis that demand much high defence expenditure be she aware that the cost of net zero be inflict untold harm on our industry and have do for some year it be now time to prioritise economic growth to target cheap energy instead of net zero and to generate growth and energy export in order that we can afford the defence we need the department be live on another planet and the minister should listen to her chancellor and her business secretary who be try to give she this advice can reassure the hon gentleman that be on planet earth and that we be well aware of what we be do we look at the world around we and see the enormous hike in energy price which be link to our be attach to the global market for oil and gas the previous government spend ten of billion of pound of taxpayer money in order to protect people against the price hike and we can not allow that to happen again it be absolutely right that we push for cheap renewable energy and remind the hon gentleman that sit in two departments the business secretary be my boss and the energy secretary be my boss they both agree with this policy as do the chancellor because it be the right thing to do through support for job support for skill the prominence of the industrial strategy and support for clean transition the minister have demonstrate what be possible when there be political will to quote her word back to she when will we be able to give the sector the support and clarity it need to continue operate for some decade the ceramic sector would love package like this or be the ceramics sector not sufficiently important enough ask the minister to keep her response short forgive madam deputy speaker be over enthusiastic and have so many thing to say always worry when my hon friend quote my word back to my hon friend and have talk often about ceramic and be well aware of the issue we have great debate in westminster hall this week on the ceramics industry challenge with the transition and with energy price we be well aware of all of they and we be work to fix they give as much time to ceramic as do to any other industry and will continue to do so the minister have previously say that energy security be national security why then be she cut energy job in the north sea yet impose and buy from energy technology company in china at good one of our competitor at bad our enemy instead of invest in this country for high pay high skilled job in the north sea be not sure how many time will have to go through this but we be not cut energy job the north sea be decline because there be less and less oil and gas there the work the previous government do on renewable energy secure no supply chain for this country so we be reliant on other country as the hon member point out we be put in place incentive for supply chain to be in this country so that we make more be deliver steel strategy to make sure that we use steel from this country for our clean energy future these be the policy we be put in place to make sure we have manage transition clean energy low bill and energy security thank the minister for her statement and for the role she play in secure future for the methil and arnish yard in my constituency under the new ownership of navantia with new and secure job for the future be glad she be take no lesson from the shadow minister give that under his government watch job be lose from the north sea what we have today be an industrial strategy that look after job secure future for the north sea and ensure that we will be there for another two generation can she explain how thing such as skill passport our investment in gb energy and our investment in the cromarty firth and hope in port such as stornoway will ensure that future thank my hon friend for his question it have be pleasure to work with he and to see the way he have champion his community during the conversation we have have about navantia and harland wolff the industrial strategy be there for reason the previous government be ideologically oppose to one for reason that nobody quite understand we be set up british energy company which the conservatives oppose for reason we do not quite understand whether it be grangemouth harland wolff the flowmis money for the port of cromarty firth our auction round for offshore wind or hydrogen we be put in place the support to make sure that we build an industry we can all be proud of energy bill be up on labour watch while our industry cry out for certainty from this labour government who have offer little more than confusion hostility and prevarication the minister talk about clarity and certainty but what she have give we be another consultation however she do not need another consultation to give we certainty on the acorn carbon capture project at st fergus which be no brainer if she be serious about economic growth will the minister confirm today that scotland will finally receive this long overdue investment for the acorn project in the spring statement later this month if only be able to confirm what will be in the spring statement but clearly can not do that we be hugely supportive of the acorn project which be an exciting opportunity we will be invest billion in carbon capture after year of failure and prevarication by the previous government that be obviously subject to the spending review and can not give the hon member the answer he be after but think this be really exciting opportunity for scotland have meet representative of many of the business involve and talk to they about what the potential could be welcome the statement particularly the minister commitment that oil and gas will be with we for decade to come be she as surprised as be to hear the announcement from reform uk of renewable investment tax that would destroy job in the north sea and in place such as hartlepool which represent as well as expose we to vladimir putin and do she suspect that that be what reform uk actually want my hon friend be completely right to expose reform argument for the nonsense they be the cbi bring out report week or so ago show that the net zero economy grow by which be much fast than the wide economy this be deliver job already as well as investment from around the world in part because we be the second most attractive country in the world in which to invest as pwc have tell we the reality be that we can bring down bill secure good job and make ourselves more energy secure and reform be live in the past as the minister know the north sea renewable sector have be very beneficial to my brigg and immingham constituency and support proposal that will enhance and speed up the development of that sector however many business in the constituency be struggle because of energy cost as my hon friend have mention can the minister give an assurance that particularly where energy intensive industry be involve the government will bear in mind the consumer be they business or domestic thank the hon gentleman for his question and indeed for the good relationship we have build up from his speak on behalf of his constituent in relation to steel and other sector that we have talk about of course energy intensive industry talk to we about energy price and we be look to see what we can do hold roundtable last week with the energy intensive industry steel chemical ceramic of course and other and we be look at what we can do to make sure they can be profitable and grow conservative lead north east lincolnshire council have embrace the green industry that be help to reshape our identity in great grimsby and cleethorpes and it be play critical role in decarbonise our energy estuary do the minister agree that the opposition new anti renewables position undermine the ambition of young people in my constituency who be excite by this sector they be keen to work with these company which do good pay well provide training and benefit the community my hon friend be stand up for the job and the young people in her community and it be shame that the national conservative party opposition do not seem clear on what their policy be where people can see the job and the benefit council such as her conservative lead council support renewable but for some reason conservative front benchers do not do not understand that but we will keep back this agenda because we know it will deliver job really interesting line in the minister statement show in my opinion the labour government complete misunderstanding of the role of the north sea she say that the reality be that new licence award in the past decade have make only marginal difference to overall production however that do not take into account the job they have support the tax intake that come with they and the skill investment and expertise they have preserve and that will help in the transition to renewable energy be the minister say in her statement that she be actually willing to sacrifice all that to ideologically stop new licence in the north sea the previous government oversee loss of job that they care not one jot about they have no plan of support and no transition plan and they allow that manage decline without any commitment this government be do exactly the opposite we be support that transition we be support those worker and we be make sure we can transition people grow the economy and deliver energy security at the same time welcome my hon friend statement and indeed the fact that there be plan although the tories now accept that they do not have plan which be at least an important admission the result of that lack of plan be that have be leave with uncertainty for both worker and consumer in east thanet we need well job and low bill and surely she will agree with that the overall security of our energy be also vital there be one solution which be to get off fossil fuel and shift to renewable energy as soon as possible my hon friend be absolutely right she be of course refer to the shadow minister the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy who say yesterday that one of the thing our party do not get right in government be set ambitious goal on energy policy without have clear plan to deliver they official report march vol entirely agree with he welcome the government commitment to no new oil and gas licence and to put worker and community at the heart of the transition to climate safe economy it be bit disappointing to hear that so many conservative member still live on planet flat earth with an ostrich approach to our energy future when what we need be phoenix approach would like to ask the minister specific question can she confirm that the billion barrel of oil equivalent currently in the north sea will not be pump if it be it would be the equivalent of run coal fire power station from now until she will know the climate implication will she confirm that the government will stop consent for new production our manifesto be clear that we would not issue new licence we would not revoke exist licence we would manage exist field for the entirety of their lifespan and we would ban fracke the consultation be about the detail behind that there be some complicated issue that we need to unpick which be why we be have the consultation why we welcome everybody view and why hope the hon lady will add her voice to it we be in the midst of yet another fossil fuel price spike cause by our overreliance on international gas market despite my constituency of stafford eccleshall and the village be landlocke and quite far from the north sea be very proud to have ge vernova large uk base there support over job and provide some of the technology for over of uk electricity do the minister agree that there be only one solution to the price spike to get off fossil fuel and move on to clean home grow power here in the uk welcome my hon friend question what ge vernova be do and the job it be provide be incredibly important for her community we will continue to encourage growth in that sector and beyond through our industrial strategy with its eight sector plan one of which be clean energy these thing be all connect we can grow the economy and deliver clean energy and we can do it together bp global headquarter be in my constituency as the minister meet industry all the time to use her word she will be fully aware that it announce major reset last month whereby it be increase its investment in upstream oil and gas to the tune of billion year from next year that be investor money not taxpayer money be the minister not concerned that by make britain hostile environment for oil and gas extraction we be simply kiss away that investment to overseas meet bp yesterday to talk about that if we look at somewhere like the us there be massive supply of oil and gas bp have make its decision we be work with it very closely on carbon capture and hydrogen in particular if we drill as much as we possibly could in the north sea we would only find less than of the global market this be decline basin that be fact it have decline significantly over the past decade and it will continue to do so we need to manage that process and support people bp be work very closely with the government on our renewable agenda and on carbon capture and hydrogen the usual luddite tendency be on display on the opposition benches after year of abject failure this government be embrace the golden triangle energy security to reduce bill transition to net zero and hundred of thousand of secure british job in scotland and across the uk do the minister agree that if the shadow minister who have great track record of lose job do not want job in scotland we will have they in cornwall my hon friend be right to point to the golden triangle of energy security job and climate and how we can bring they together be work hard not as hard as he he be work incredibly hard on bring as many job as possible to his constituency look forward to continue to do that rise keep repeat myself short question please as someone with two generation of their family who have depend on the north sea oil and gas industry know that we have to move away from fossil fuel and that we have to drive forward to the just transition but we must also recognise that we be not there yet and that this be not the moment to push the industry off cliff it be decline naturally we be leave ourselves in position where we will still need oil so will we import it we will need gas for hydrogen production plastic chemical and pharmaceutical all of that be necessary we also face threat from the chinese try to infiltrate our renewable so what be the government go to do about that as hope make clear we be not revoke exist licence and we will manage the exist field for the entirety of their lifespan as also make clear this be decline basin and we need to manage the transition the hon lady be absolutely right to point to the challenge and have great respect for her family history and for all those who work in oil and gas she be right that we will need oil and gas for decade to come we be try to have sensible plan to manage that process and hope she will take part in the consultation too the minister have already allude to last week cbi report which set out some of the huge opportunity that net zero offer for job creation investment and growth will she outline to the house what step her department be take to ensure we benefit from all that opportunity through great british energy and the national wealth fund the national wealth fund and great british energy will be incredibly important in this space most country have sovereign wealth fund like the national wealth fund we have set that up most country have their state energy company we have load of state energy company just other country it be absolutely right that we set up our own we also have the clean energy bonus which will mean that we be encourage supply chain and job here in the uk so we can move away from reliance on other country with due deference to the newly appoint minister for aberdeen on the conservative benches the question of these job be not matter purely for the north east or purely for scotland those job be spread across every constituency in this country and they be all at risk as we hear from the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine they be be push off cliff edge the minister talk about our energy bill be in the hand of vladimir putin do she not agree with that we be stick between rock and hard place we have vladimir putin on one side drive up energy bill and her dogmatic secretary of state for energy security and net zero on the other do not agree with that framing whatsoever we have putin who invade ukraine lead to the massive global shock for energy price and we have secretary of state who be very pragmatically take forward plan to as the triangle tell we protect and grow job and give we energy security think most people in the country understand that they get that we need energy security and to tackle the climate at the same time scandalously the worker of the grangemouth refinery be to be the victim of very unjust transition the folly of foreign state and private capital be in charge of such key vital piece of energy infrastructure be lay bare especially with no uk government involvement be curious as to what ownership role the uk government will take in the new energy industry that will be at grangemouth my hon friend will know about the announcement that be make recently about support for grangemouth in the last couple of week meet ineo to talk about its chemical factory and the huge contribution it bring in term of job and the provision of chemical the million investment from the national wealth fund be really important in this space the work that the government have do to look at possible business and industry for grangemouth in the future be really important and be very happy to have conversation with he final question while very much welcome the move towards clean energy my concern be that we can not allow energy price to rise any far especially when we take into account the loss of the winter fuel payment for many pensioner on the poverty line how will the minister ensure that clean energy and heat will not be out of reach for those who be already struggle the elderly the vulnerable those in poor health and those in poverty the hon gentleman raise really important point we know that energy bill have be rise because of the oil and gas we rely on and the impact of the war in ukraine we have massively increase the warm home discount so that million household will get to help towards their energy bill but he be right to champion people who be go through cost of living crisis we will do what we can to support they that mark the end of the statement could not get all colleague in because question be so long and answer be occasionally just as lengthy point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker on second reading of the data use and access bill on february raise concern over the accuracy and reliability of datum with the minister for data protection and telecoms the hon member for rhondda and ogmore chris bryant particularly in relation to verification of sex he undertake to write to which indeed he have digital verification service can be use to prove sex or gender in the same way that individual can already prove their sex use their passport for example that be direct quote from the letter in fact passport do no such thing it say what sex someone likely be for example if it say someone be female it mean they be likely female but they could be male with gender recognition certificate or male person who have letter from their doctor say that they be likely to continue live as though female for the rest of their life this have be the case for many year be worried that this letter which have be put in both libraries may mislead the house or indeed any constituent who may need to read it how can correct the record in this regard be grateful to the hon lady for give notice of her point of order understand that she have notify the hon member for rhondda and ogmore that she intend to raise the matter in the chamber the chair be not responsible for the accuracy of ministerial correspondence however the hon lady have put her point on the record and be sure that those on the treasury bench will indeed take note supply and appropriation anticipation and adjustment bill motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the bill be now read second time question agree to bill accordingly read second time question put forthwith that the bill be now read the third time question agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass backbench business international women day beg to move that this house have consider international women day thank the backbench

most diverse parliament with female member we all know our number madam deputy speaker be the woman to be elect to this house and the first elect black female minister in the uk under gordon brown government as shadow minister be instrumental in get the international women day flag fly over the house and in get the first iwd debate on the floor of the house remember ask the speaker at the time whether my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips who be now the under secretary of state for the home department could read out the name of the woman who have be kill by man to start the debate just that without speech think it still take about seven or eight minute ten year later that list be still just as long it still take that amount of time how can that be how can it be that woman be still kill every three day by partner or former partner there be still woman who be not count such as woman who commit suicide because of domestic abuse and tran woman and girl have be think about this lot have be tell that heterosexual or straight white man and boy feel that there be no long place for they in society and that be why they be turn to the far right that really sadden because there be place for everyone in society there be of course place for straight white man and boy there be very important role for they to play in society we will hear lot today about the fact that one woman be kill every three day and that of they be kill by man the majority of whom be white if we want to protect woman we need to reach out to man the one who be inform kind and loving and we need to say we need you now more than ever before right now there be some serious toxic misogynistic man some of whom be straight and they be harm woman society gay people and black people this be the very foundation on which we live we need to say no in the uk woman be murder by current or former partner every week accord to research from women aid of woman have face some form of abuse in an intimate relationship during their lifetime give these harrowing statistic we must confront domestic abuse for what it truly be national emergency do she agree that lifesave specialist domestic abuse service which have be chronically underfunde must receive the investment that they so desperately need my hon friend hit on an important point we absolutely need that investment if we be serious about save life we need to do whatever it take if we want to see reduction in the number of woman be kill we need to invest in make that happen we also need to have those uncomfortable conversation it be not tough to hit woman as be spout by andrew tate or to rape woman or to ridicule woman or girl because they have say no we have to have those conversation we have to say this be wrong we have to talk to all the man feel like that be wear male shirt and tie today but it do not mean that the world be go to run out of male shirt and tie there be enough to go around for everybody and we have to have that conversation we have to show man love woman we have to educate boy and girl it be interesting that some father treat their daughter like princess and think that by treat they that way their daughter will learn how to be treat but the reality be that they will learn by how their father treat his partner can not stay for the debate unfortunately but want to have this on the record the statistic on the murder of woman in northern ireland be the high in the united kingdom the minister know that do the hon lady agree that when it come to address the murder of woman across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we need strategy that start here in westminster and sweep out to the rest of the region we have to well manage and respond to this issue and protect our woman and lady and young girl both in northern ireland and across the united kingdom thank the hon gentleman for that intervention be sure he will be forgive for miss half of debate today woman be be kill that be fact we have get too used to talk about the statistic without think about who be at the end of it and that we be lose woman every three day to murder it start somewhere at the end of the day the way that woman be demonise and attack and the way that we attack tran woman it start somewhere it be deliberate act and action also want to thank organisation such as the fawcett society centenary action whose all party parliamentary group co chair with the shadow minister the hon member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies and the asian women resource centre in brent it be important that we start to celebrate woman as the mayor do in rename the overground line the line that get on be rename the lioness line at first be little confused think be on the right train now though smile because know that when people ask why it be call the lioness line the response will always be because really great female football team bring the cup home those be the little thing that we can do that will make big difference many man feel insecure about that so we need to tell they not to worry and to just chill there be man who say that we should not talk about first woman who be first to do this or first to do that say that we should celebrate those woman because they show that we have make bit of progress for example we have the first female deputy speaker of colour in the chair congratulation on that madam deputy speaker hon member hear hear we have the first female metro mayor tracy brabin and the first register blind mp for battersea my hon friend the member for battersea marsha de cordova could spend my whole time talk about all those first but we do still have way to go there be more good people in the world than bad see man in power say do celebrate woman do talk about woman some even say erase woman which be really quite scary they be literally try to erase woman and our achievement but know that there be man who can and must speak out the reality be that we have some aggressive white supremacist male who be say that woman should not exist or that we belong in the kitchen and that be it we can not go backwards we have come too far so that just ai go to happen if be to ban step ask members to bear with for moment and replace they with slope would that stop people from get to their destination no it would not but would it help people who have problem with walk or who be in wheelchair to get to their destination yes it would this be not necessarily about take something away it can be about change something to help other people also get to their destination to all those boy and man who feel that they have to turn to the far right or to become incel say be it time to change be it time for you to change how you talk how you act and the attitude that you take would you like your mother your sister your girlfriend or your partner to be talk about or treat in the way that you treat woman my hon friend be make powerful speech be sure that all those young woman in brent and north london who be watch she will be very proud one topic that often come up in our local mother whatsapp chat be social medium my hon friend be talk lot about change statistic show that after spend time online and on social medium of young woman and girl feel lonely and depressed because of all the online abuse do she think that social media platform need to take some responsibility for the content that be amplify through their platform social medium platform have vital role to play they understand that negativity spread fast than positivity in the old day of legacy medium it be often say if it bleed it lead those platform be absolutely aware of the damage that they do they will not voluntarily make the change that they need to make and as government we need to legislate for those change to be make when watch the story of the women army corps unit of colour which star kerry washington as captain charity adams actually cry the central postal directory battalion contribute to the war effort in unique way they sort through million piece of mail and deliver it to american soldier on the frontline those black woman improve morale and bring hope to the frontline yet after go through all of that they be discriminate against and history try to erase they we have to wonder why that be why do people continually try to erase woman and people of colour from history thank my hon friend for give way and for secure this debate as we mark international women day have to say that be proud absolutely honoured to stand here not only as black woman but as former nurse however black people be four time more likely to be detain under the mental health act do she agree that we can only truly say that we have honour international women day when this glaring disparity be address my hon friend be also first so congratulate she on that and yes absolutely agree with she on that point on average we will all live to see christmas the thing be what be we go to do with they some people in the world be act like they will live forever god hope we do not and know that that will not be the case but some pass through the world leave it just as they find it our job in parliament be to change the world for the well we need to leave an indelible footprint by ensure that the world protect all woman not just straight white woman we should start with the gay woman the black woman and the disabled woman if we protect those we will protect all woman and the world will be well place often say that can not get my right until everybody have their right because our right and our life be very much intertwine whether we believe it or not and just because be pro woman pro and pro black it do not mean as have be say online that be anti white far from it be pro jerk chicken and rice and pea and still love bit of pie and mash and fish and chip we can love more than one thing and be pro many thing want to end with cold reality check in malcolm gladwell brilliant book the tipping point and in his follow up book revenge of the tipping point he talk about the law of the very few the overstory and the counterfactual line what would have happen if we be slowly win the war on highlight violence against woman and girl highlight injustice and highlight discrimination but we do not appreciate the honest conversation that we need to have around how epidemic work or appreciate the power of group proportion we be fool ourselves if we think that we bear no responsibility for this epidemic of violence against woman and girl epidemic have rule and they have boundary they be subject to overstorie and we in society be in position of power to create those overstorie these overstorie change in size and shape when they reach tipping point and it be possible to know when we be reach that tipping point we be currently at that tipping point when it come to violence against woman and girl the opioid crisis in the us be lesson for we all most of the medical profession act professionally but tiny fraction just few do not and that be enough to fuel an opioid epidemic in the us that tiny fraction be drive by certain class of people and those people can be identify the tool need to control an epidemic be right in front of we they be sit on the table and we can either grab those tool or let the unscrupulous people grab they if we grab they we can build well world we need to take action and have an honest conversation we need to ensure that organisation that believe in diversity equality and inclusion and fair pay get the procurement contract we need to be mindful about the social medium platform that we use and we need to elect people who care for many people not just the by do that we will accelerate action which be the theme of international women day this year end with message to the straight white boy and man in the middle of the table we need your protection we need your love we need your care and we need your kindness we know as have say that daughter and young girl learn how to be treat by their partner by watch how man treat woman in their life and young boy learn how to be man from the man in their life so we need all man regardless of colour class and economic status to lead by example woman be literally fight for their life want every single man in the world watch this debate to join we in that struggle we should all believe in fairness we should all believe in end discrimination and homophobia in the time that it have take to make this speech one woman globally will have be kill by her partner or family member may her soul rest in peace it be privilege to speak in today international women day debate thank the hon member for brent east dawn butler for secure it want to use the opportunity to pay tribute to the extraordinary contribution of scottish woman and particularly those from my constituency and the wide north east scotland when we be speak about woman break barrier need look no far than methlick in aberdeenshire the birthplace of dame evelyn glennie profoundly deaf from the age of dame evelyn do not just overcome that challenge but revolutionise our understanding of how music can be experience feel vibration all through her body to become the world first full time solo percussionist with over performance worldwide each year and have commission more than new work she have show how determination can transform what many would see as limitation into unique strength in inverurie the large town in my constituency we have hannah miley who train at the garioch amateur swimming club before represent great britain at the london and rio olympics what many do not know about her remarkable story however be that she spend her life training in metre pool rather than the olympic standard metre facility of her competitor often share lane with the public she go on to become commonwealth gold medallist and now inspire the next generation of swimmer across scotland in the realm of science aberdeen professor dame anne glover stand as testament to scottish woman intellectual prowess not only do she serve as the first chief scientific adviser in scotland but she become the first chief scientific adviser to the president of the european commission her pioneer work in microbial biosensor at the university of aberdeen have place our region at the forefront of scientific innovation in agriculture which be so important to my constituency we see woman take ever more prominent role jane craigie from aberdeenshire exemplify that leadership as co founder of the rural youth project which connect young people with opportunity in agriculture the skill and determination of woman farmer be essential to our local economy and the future of scotland agricultural sector it would be remiss of not also to mention professor lorna dawson cbe who be base in aberdeen at the james hutton institute as of she have continue her pioneer work in soil forensic and have help to solve numerous criminal case advise police investigation across the uk professor dawson be recently award the royal society of edinburgh james hutton medal for her exceptional contribution to earth and environmental science her work connect soil science to justice demonstrate how expertise from our region be make difference both nationally and internationally of course it would be wrong for anyone on the conservative benches not to acknowledge the break legacy of margaret thatcher the uk first female prime minister whose determination to succeed in male dominate political world open door for woman across the political spectrum her legacy continue to inspire woman in politic every day finally and most important to there be my mum who be as far as have be report the first woman mechanic on an all weather lifeboat when she join the crew of station in ireland in there really be nothing more inspiring if not bit scary for an eight year old to watch their mum pull on her drysuit and head out to sea in gale force condition she would not forgive if do not emphasise the open mindedness of the man on the crew who almost year ago be willing and able to see her potential not her gender just this morning my mum tell only become mechanic because the crew be willing to give chance decade of tradition with fisherman take to sea and allow to achieve it particularly tony the coxswain if the crew have be so open minded would have become one let we use this international women day to reaffirm our commitment to empower woman and create more equitable future for all call the chair of the women and equalities committee thank my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler for introduce this incredibly important international women day debate the debate be always well attend but it be also one of the most informative and heartfelt debate we have in parliament be incredibly proud to take part as chair of the women and equalities committee it have be say that the committee have have quite fly start we have do lot but answer that with the fact that there be lot to do this year international women day theme as have already be say be accelerate action and we know that we can not slow down we do have to accelerate and not just with word but with action on behalf of the whole committee be proud to say that we will not be slow down any time soon in less than year we have focus our work very much on key area we have also continue the fantastic work of the previous committee and particularly on health last year we produce report on woman reproductive health which we call medical misogyny some people say that quite strong but frankly we could not describe the evidence that we have see in the inquiry as anything other than medical misogyny diagnosis for adenomyosis and endometriosis take on average eight year that be the average so there be people wait much long than eight year just for diagnosis not treatment that be woman be ignore and be leave in pain know woman who have be eventually diagnose with adenomyosis or endometriosis but be fob off time and again by medical practitioner and doctor they be tell have some paracetamol hot water bottle and lie down and you be fine that again be an example of where woman be ignore to the detriment of their health as well as our country health and our economy health painful procedure such as hysteroscopy and intrauterine device fitting be still take place for woman without any offer of pain relief sharp pinch no not on my nelly be that sharp pinch again be grateful that man do not have to endure that pain but why be it that woman still do even though the guideline have change woman be still have to go through incredibly painful procedure without the relief that they deserve one recommendation in our report make clear the need to educate our young people well about what to expect for woman reproductive health that go for boy as well as girl we need to end the stigma of period and period poverty in particular young people also need to know what be normal we be often tell it normal that your period will hurt you bleed and you go to be uncomfortable but it be not normal to be curl up in bed for seven day it be not normal for period or menstrual cycle to be so painful that they stop we from go to school take part in pe or go to work all those thing be not normal yet it have be ingrain in we that it be normal for we to be in pain and that it be normal for our life to be disrupt by our hormone and everything that be happen with our body frankly it be not that be why one of the recommendation make it clear that we need to do well to educate ourselves and our young people and enable our educator to have the tool and the resource they need so that the next generation of woman and young man know exactly what happen to woman body when it come to research this stick in my mind when we be do the report far too much have be tailor towards man and man medical need we know that the average paracetamol dose for example be the correct dosage for western male not for woman it be the same with seatbelt and everything else but here be something five time more research go into erectile dysfunction which affect of man than premenstrual syndrome which affect of woman when we talk about action we need to see it across the board particularly in health there be progress absolutely there be and be so proud that we will see the employment rights bill come forward next week but there be always way to improve always the committee produce report in january that look specifically at miscarriage bereavement leave that issue be very close to my heart and know that many inside and outside this chamber have long campaign for the right to grieve the loss of pregnancy follow miscarriage we have see some movement and that be incredibly welcome now be the time for action there be thousand of employer out there that already offer bereavement leave for worker who miscarry many be private sector employer and let we be honest they be not do it out of the kindness of their heart they be do it because it be financially rewarding it be reputationally good and it be good for their worker they include massive company such as tui which go to visit last week at the hangar in luton airport do not contain my inner child when sit in cockpit will tell you that but once gather myself ask where be all the woman engineer they say that they be really struggle as they want to have more woman engineer also ask where be your woman apprentice because they have fantastic apprenticeship there they be so ripe and they be ready ask what be your workplace policy for miscarriage they say do you know what wish more people know tui offer time off for grief with miscarriage bereavement leave there be company out there the co operative group be another do the right thing and try to make sure that the workplace be right for woman in the case of public sector employer the nhs offer miscarriage bereavement leave for its worker the large public sector employer of woman in our country offer bereavement leave for those who miscarry have have representative sit in front of in two different committees the public accounts committee pre election and now the women and equalities committee and ask they twice how much that cost the chief finance officer for the nhs say it be de minimis translation basically nothing it be not cost they anything to offer that if anything it be save they in term of staff retention and length of time off sick when we do not grieve well and do not have the space and time to grieve we store up problem in the long term think society have catch up with that it be time the law do too we hear in committee about the difference that change in law could make from woman who be brave enough to give testimony of their experience of multiple miscarriage and of have to drive themselves to hospital because their partner or their husband could not take time off and nearly bleed to death along the way know the difference change in law could make and how angry be when have to take sick pay when have my three miscarriage people be really lovely and be very open about it but not one single person say to get well soon they say be sorry for your loss if society have move on and realise that miscarriage and pregnancy loss be loss and not sickness it be time our law do as well my hon friend the member for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton mention maternal health in her intervention and know that we will hear more about the need to close the gap on maternal death rate for black mother clo and tinuke at five more be do fantastic work on that and praise everybody who be work to close that gap because it be much need yesterday at the select committee we hear evidence on female genital mutilation there be an estimate victim of fgm in our country and fear that number be much high from the evidence we hear yesterday on the level of under reporting there be much noise and much movement and progress make year ago but that progress have stall some of the training manual for doctor and midwife be year out of date they be well past time for review and in the last year we have see about three prosecution for fgm know that prosecution be perhaps not where we need to be and do not want to predetermine the outcome of the report but prevention be huge part of the answer we will present our report accordingly another area on which we have produce report be technology which have already be touch upon we produce very chunky report on non consensual intimate image abuse which be deeply personal crime that can have life change and life threaten consequence as the live experience of inquiry witness georgia harrison demonstrate the committee hear shocking evidence about the scale and impact of ncii abuse with tenfold increase in just four year and more than report case in every victim of sexual offence deserve to be treat with respect and have their case investigate promptly and effectively by the police however that be not what we hear in many case police treatment of victim of intimate image abuse have be characterise by lack of understanding and in some case misogyny with officer choose to patronise victim rather than support they that be totally unacceptable and must change we welcome the government proposal to make create nciis an offence but legal gap remain nciis can continue to circulate online year after the image be post even though many site will eventually remove the content when prompt around do not there be not yet enough in the government proposal in the crime and policing bill to address that concern we would love to see the government bring forward amendment to the bill to make possession of nciis in addition to their creation an offence that will put nciis on the same footing as child sexual abuse material in how they be treat online and we hope provide the necessary encouragement to block or disrupt access to such content particularly that which have be host overseas we be also do work on community cohesion gendere islamophobia share parental leave and woman in business and entrepreneur which be incredibly important because the government be focus on growth woman must play significant part in that there be lot that could talk about there be far too much in this speech already and be sure that there will be load in this debate but we live in an increasingly divisive world and woman be at the sharp end of it why do we even need an international women day debate to be honest really wish we do not but we need it because progress be not inevitable we be see in country such as iraq the lowering of the age of consent to nine nine and consent those two word do not go together child can not give consent woman body be be use as weapon of war in the democratic republic of the congo in kashmir in the middle east and in xinjiang the list go on it be hard to be woman than it should be one day really hope that we will need international women day not to highlight the problem or ask for action but to celebrate the progress there have be progress make and want to end on high note which be sport woman sport love it absolutely adore it and know that there be some big fan here from the lionesses to luton town ladies there be fantastic success be all excited when the lionesses be on television but be so glad that when say to my five year old girl look at this look at woman football it on the television she look at and go yeah and shrug her shoulder for she that be the norm it be not something special for it be something special to see that but for she it be the norm want it to be the norm for every little girl in our country will now do something that be little bit left field for go to sky sports event and it be fantastic sporty spice be there so the year old be even more excited than in the cockpit of plane there be fantastic sportswoman but also the people who support and show the sport and show that there be money and progress to be have from it and that people want to watch and consume it and cheer sportswoman on from the stand at the start of the event there be an incredible speak word piece there be also song but do not worry will not sing by fantastic and beautiful artist call sophia thakur we all know that famous barbie monologue we have all hear it have we for this just go one step far and will end by read just little bit of what she say it be call gladiators they say you strong for girl or fast for woman how can she be girl how can gold be woman they call you butterfly because they see those wing know you the eagle type high above these thing they say to act like girl but the whole world would be if we deceive our power the land tremble as we rise from the dust come our tower but we meet these mountain that we be expect to climb but with no sweat no muscle no grind but with makeup and gentleness and the kind of competitiveness that comfortable for they and kind they like would you mind maintain your shape your figure do get too strong practise soft voice and some grace but still win still first place but like lady might funny there it when my strong feel most like the lady type when these leg activate and can jump to crazy height when these shoulder broaden and can carry both the world and its opinion straight to the finish god bless the strength in these arm ah how they have hold over the year and god bless the sister have find sit across from my fear this table be lay before we in the presence of our frenemie we celebrate for our win whilst they berate our anatomy to be woman be to live twice to live firstly for the thing that you love and then second life for the fight one mind for the game and then this other for the might that it might take to still choose this day after day give the girl two gold medal give the woman double the pay give they triple their portion let your applause reverberate sing her song when you sing of the great and strike for woman from after her name because if she have change the face of the whole game she be victorious over history would you like to be as you grow who would you like to become as you age would you like to be pretty have your face across page or would you like to be demure know for your softness and your patience or girl tell how would you like to become gladiator to all the woman gladiator in this place past and present and outside it thank you one day international women day will be about the realisation of all our hope and ambition until that day be proud to be gladiator with you rise order we start with an immediate four minute time limit be honour to speak in this debate in advance of international women day on saturday march which will be celebrate with the all woman steam train crew at rheilffordd talyllyn railway in tywyn international women day remain as relevant now as ever we and the generation of woman who have come before we have achieve so much since the first international women day in but we still have long way to go when we talk about gender equal society let we be clear about where we mean in the home in public space in the workplace here in westminster we celebrate that of this parliament be now woman indeed we be take photograph just yesterday morning to that effect in the senedd the cross party woman caucus have be re establish bold show of force between woman across the political divide those be positive step towards gender balance but not necessarily towards gender equality include equally safe workplace which will speak about now member will know that tuc poll find that three in five woman have experience sexual harassment bullying or verbal abuse in the workplace report of sexual assault rape stalk and coercive control from colleague make up around of call make to the rights of women sexual harassment at work advice line but as it stand protection be limited the worker protection amendment of equality act act create preventive duty for employer to take reasonable step to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace but an automatic investigation into breach of that duty only take place after an individual successfully bring claim of sexual harassment and many other form of gender base violence in the workplace be exclude meanwhile the health and safety at work etc act which be so familiar to employer place duty on employer to ensure the health safety and welfare of employee at work why not use the tough mechanism we have in the workplace to tackle workplace gender base harassment and violence too that be exactly what my health and safety at work etc act amendment bill develop with the brilliant suzy lamplugh trust and rights of women seek to do alongside new clause and to the employment rights bill which would have the same effect hope that hon member will consider support those new clause my bill would introduce clear actionable duty for employer to protect worker from violence and harassment include risk assessment policy development and the provision of recognition and prevention training to all employee those boring sound thing would make difference in the workplace and to people life the bill would mandate the health and safety executive which do not currently consider gender base violence workplace hazard and be not view as the primary authority for bullying harassment or domestic abuse in the workplace to develop and publish an enforceable health and safety framework on violence and harassment in the workplace and to issue guidance for employer leverage health and safety legal framework that be already in place would require employer to actively work towards eliminate gender base violence while establish systematic and publicly enforceable approach to the prevention of and safeguard from the spectrum of gender base violence in the workplace if these be the difference we wish to make difference to woman life in the workplace let we use all the power we have at our disposal and make they work for woman more effectively than they presently do let use all our power hope everyone enjoy international women day on saturday it be an honour to be here today as the first mp to represent bolsover who be woman hon member hear hear thank you be surround by fantastic woman not only here but in bolsover woman who run business and nurture our next generation such as foster carer sonja dayson in creswell woman who inspire we as community leader

woodlands enterprise will spend this week celebrate they all and more today want to talk about the hide issue that affect we woman too often our private burden if we look at the last parliament the bbc be discuss more often than childcare fishing be five time more likely to be mention than menopause this historic house which woman die to get we into spend more time discuss football than rape my daughter she be brave and wonderful tell mum every time you talk about rape every time you say the word bristle please do not stop my baby my little baby be about to start big school the datum tell that while she be there she will witness sexual harassment and potentially be send dick pic and there be nothing that can do to protect she from that this be not class or age thing it do not matter how far we go back it be an accepted part of the story of mary queen of scots that the noble choose among themselves who be go to rape she with the intention of impregnate she yet we still do not accept that that happen in the uk ten birth happen every day from rape there be no charity to support those woman and no advice on the nhs website the man can access those child at any time they like every single one of we have either be rap or know someone who have be rap rape be part of our story as woman yet it be part that we do not tell want to tell you about rape and be an mp rape threat be an accepted part of the job thank the minister for speak up about this disgusting truth be the woman mp rape crisis estimate that quarter of woman have be rap or sexually assault if we apply that datum to mps that mean that of we have be rap and half of woman mp will have be rap more than once statistically of they will have report it give miracle or on an optimistic day one could have lead to conviction at the very good thank my hon friend for give way during her extremely powerful speech will she remind everybody of the importance not only of the fact of rape but of prosecute and convict the perpetrator of those rape so that we remember that this be not simply about passive violence against woman and girl but about identify the cause and the people who do those crime thank my hon friend for her intervention be proud to be part of government who have set out an unprecedented ambition to halve violence against woman and girl but what want we to think about on this day be how we tell our story have speak publicly about give birth after be the victim of statutory rape and be sick of be tell be brave do not want to be brave want it to be expect that we tell our truth courage call to courage everywhere let we make it normal to talk about rape in workplace in kitchen with friend instead of bristle let we talk about it like we talk about football let we talk to our boy about consent and celebrate the man who be our ally most importantly listen to she support she and for god sake believe she if you be one of the colleague friend or constituent who have tell about your rape ask you to tell each other you will be surprised how many people believe you and then share their story with you too be the very proud nana of beautiful granddaughter she be four week old and name after one of the suffragette who help to get here today genuinely believe that if we be brave now and make speak out the norm we can have world in which she tell her grandchild about the fact that they do it and we hide it want that to be the part that her grandchild do not believe there be lot to do and it can feel overwhelming but let we put our arm around each other and use our power to force that shame to change side think that international women day be fantastic because it give the opportunity to pay tribute to someone whose birthday would have be on international women day have she not be bear in hope that she pass the gladiator bar to which the hon member for luton north sarah owen refer beatrice shilling be one of the most consequential people of the century that people have never hear of she be bear in waterlooville hampshire and soon become one of those child who love take thing to bit she win meccano prize she save up her pocket money and buy she first motorbike at the age of by she be only the second woman ever to record an average speed of mph around the brooklands circuit just over the river thames from my spelthorne constituency by beatrice shilling be at the royal aircraft establishment obviously the second world war be upon we crucially the rolls royce merlin engine use in the hurricanes and spitfires have fatal flaw once pilot go into negative force dive the engine have propensity to flood and cut out the germans do not have that problem because they have fuel injector and they soon work out that the british pilot face the dilemma of whether or not to follow they that could have be catastrophic so people turn to tilly shilling as she be universally know to come up with solution she invent small thing the size of thimble with little hole in it which could crucially be fit to the fuel line of the merlin engine without take the plane to bit mean that the much need air power of the second world war could remain in the fight beatrice

she visit newgate prison and instead of walk on by she take action she fund prison school for the child who be incarcerate along with their mother in those day she teach employment skill she promote rehabilitation as concept which be new at that stage and she develop wide movement for reform in elizabeth fry be the first woman ever to give evidence to house of commons inquiry directly because of her campaigning work we have the gaols act and the prisons act which be the beginning of the end of the truly terrible condition of the century we talk now about violence against woman and girl but that be not new in her personal diary she expressly discuss the need to protect female prisoner from rape and sexual exploitation recognise that thing have improve beyond recognition from those day and we should celebrate that today and at other time but too much remain the same under the last government new offence of stalk non fatal strangulation coercive control and public sexual harassment be introduce the fact that that new legislation be need demonstrate our corporate failure to change attitude those condition would have be familiar to elizabeth fry back in the our work be not about legislation because that be not the solution legislation deal with and treat symptom but the problem be the generational transfer of attitude be sorry to say typically from father to son it be our work to challenge those generational attitude do not often agree with the hon member for brent east dawn butler but on this stand shoulder to shoulder with she diolch madam deputy speaker as the previous chief executive officer of the women equality network wales have long history of campaign for woman equality be really proud of the work we do on the campaign to get more woman into public

increasingly heavy and painful period that stop go to work some day because of the heavy flow could not be more than one minute away from the loo eventually the bleeding be so bad and unstoppable that end up in think have haemorrhage it be fibroid with one as big as an orange later finally get the hysterectomy need and the story end happily here be but with the hysterectomy come an immediate overnight menopause stupidly think could get through it without the help of drug and refuse the patch offer to in the hospital despite be the ceo of women equality network charity have not do my research be grateful to my incredible friend and the nhs for help to understand what be go on be proud of our government bold and important commitment to halve violence against woman in decade but connect to that be an issue that fill my inbox the inefficiency of the child maintenance service which create an impossible situation to my mind it be unforgiveable that after woman have make the difficult decision to leave her partner she can continue to be abuse by her husband financially as the cms fail to prevent that would like to take moment to thank the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips who have inspire over the year and do so much on violence against woman finally highlight the talented inspire and wonderful woman of monmouthshire who come to my international women day event in chepstow on saturday it be pleasure to be join by so many inspiring woman and we raise for cyfannol women aid as other speaker have say international women day be bear out of struggle wag by past generation of woman whose effort and sacrifice will by and large not be record in the history book but whose action have enable other woman to walk an easy path through life than they perhaps do unfortunately the continuation of that struggle seem more pertinent now than at any other time in my adult life as there be concerted attempt to roll back the hard win gain of the woman movement we see that in the toxic influence of resurgent reactionary politic amplify via two loosely regulate social medium platform enable misogyny literally to reach into the bedroom of young teenage boy be refer to not just the andrew tates of the world but the donald trumps of this world who ridicule the very notion of there be an unequal playing field that hinder the life of woman indeed trump and his supporter state the exact opposite in their world it be man and white man in particular who be the real victim of move to tackle inequality two thing about that narrative worry first it be get traction in this country study conduct by the global institute for women leadership at king college london find that nearly one in two that when it come to give woman equal right with man thing have go far enough in great britain that be notable increase on the who say the same last year and stark increase on the proportion who feel that way as recently as that mean that for the first time britons be now more likely than americans to agree that woman equality have go far enough secondly those view normalise misogyny and encourage violence against woman and girl they literally put woman life in danger it be therefore critical for mp to reassert the reality of institutionalised misogyny and sexism which more often than not be deny whether in the house of commons the police force or the military where instance of misogyny be put down to some bad apple and the institution involve be let off the hook we have to demonstrate more forcefully zero tolerance approach to hate and abuse against woman we also need more practical measure right now to make it safe for woman to live their life free of harassment and to go about their everyday life without fear of attack two year after the murder of sarah everard it should be the least that we can do in her memory and in the memory of approximately woman murder by order thank my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler for allow we to do what this house do at its good speak as one and work together international women day be an opportunity for we all to celebrate the achievement of woman reflect on the progress we have make and crucially recommit to the work still to be do as we have be rightly remind throughout this debate there be still many many battle to be win whether in our local community across the nation or globally woman have always be at the forefront of change often have to fight to have their voice hear yet they have make significant contribution and lead movement for justice and equality the fight for woman right be fight for economic justice reproductive right and freedom from violence and discrimination it be fight against exploitation traffic and the silencing of woman voice the theme for international women day this year be accelerate action while every single one of we in this place have role to play in that it be also necessary for our community like other member will take moment to share the story and celebrate the achievement of some really spectacular woman in my constituency however not single one of they would say that they be spectacular or that they be do something above and beyond they be woman like lavinia mcelhinney the lady president at woodilee bowling club whom meet at the club fundraising coffee morning last year woman sport such as bowling be just as important at the sport on the telly there be louise carberry primary pupil at kilsyth primary school whose app design skill see she win the make it happen club app design challenge her save the whale idea be not only recognise but develop into reality yet another woman go into science technology engineering and math there

that be biased be guide brownie and an occasional adult volunteer but the volunteer there be bring young woman forward our fight be not finish the battle for equality continue everywhere so let we recommit ourselves to not only celebrate progress but truly accelerate action as grow old find myself become more and more intensely aware of the injustice that confront woman and girl every day in the uk will cover few point begin with health it be alarming to note that the national institute for health and care excellence recognise that up to nine out of woman suffer from period pain three out of of they severely and that up to three in eight adolescent girl and woman face heavy period with one in woman in their and take the difficult step to consult their gp each year because of heavy period or menstrual problem those issue be very common but we should not accept they as normal really welcome the comment of my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen on they it be equally alarming to recognise the error band in those statistic they be huge with the upper limit be five and time the low limit value for the two stat that open with we simply do not know enough about these condition we have deficit in research knowledge and clinical solution and we need to do more those issue be the live experience of woman but they be the responsibility of we all will talk about an issue that sit primarily with man have listen to the story of man in my constituency of worcester talk about the impact that pornography have have on their mental health on their relationship and by extension on the woman in their life pornography be wildly addictive harmful to man and hazardous to woman we be now in world where it be industrially available and increasingly violent and it be silently fuel sexual violence and exploitation want we to move rapidly to implement regulation and enforcement that be fierce fast and forceful to make our country safe will also raise local issue in my constituency of worcester which be very urgent and important the dawn project support survivor of domestic violence in worcestershire have hear at first hand the story of survivor who have find their life transform by the service it be save life and restore future but it be at risk as funding stream be dry up local people in worcester be dig deep and try to crowdfund money to support the charity in the meantime but would be very grateful if the minister would meet with to discuss way in which we can secure the future of the dawn project in worcester thank my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler for bring this important debate to the house it be vital that we honour international women day to not only recognise the remarkable achievement of woman in my city of gloucester and across the country but accelerate the drive for equality that be still so desperately need sadly far too many woman come to my surgery with harrowing experience of discrimination in the workplace inequality in the healthcare system and violence and domestic abuse at home many be deeply concerned about the alarming rise in violence and last year sadly we see sexual and domestic abuse and violence reach record level in gloucester on the latter point be proud to have present my ten minute rule bill early this year which seek to provide victim and survivor of domestic abuse with the right to access day of pay safe leave have have the privilege of work with employer and organisation such as the hollie gazzard trust women aid fearfree safelives and the gloucestershire domestic abuse support service to develop that bill we know that one in four woman will experience domestic abuse in their lifetime mean that the bill will help many woman to rebuild their life and encourage the government to add that to their mission the theme for this year international women day be accelerate action and be encourage by the government commitment to do just that we have commit to an

quality inclusive maternity care we need join up meaningful inclusive maternity care pathway throughout pregnancy birth and the post natal period to improve access experience and outcome for disabled woman crucially there must be nothing about we without we disabled woman must be central in improve maternity care service and while meet some wonderful clinician we must increase their understanding through well training and update clinical guideline to secure appropriate care finally we must ensure that healthcare facility equipment and information be accessible and that reasonable adjustment to maternity ward enable disabled woman to recover from birth with dignity thank my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball for her incredibly powerful speech all the woman who have hear speak today and those who have form such supportive group as new mps in this house however the people primarily want to thank today be the woman who look after my child and all the woman who look after all of our child of course childcare be not solely the provenance of woman but the overwhelming majority of the childcare workforce in this country be woman it be some of the most undervalue work in our society it be often pay at minimum wage and other parent can not work without it know that nursery provider be currently deeply concerned labour be put billion into the early year and we want of child to be school ready that be an ambitious target and be proud of it but the people who will deliver that work be our childminder and our nursery staff childcare be key national infrastructure for which we need stable and well train workforce if we do not fund early year and childcare well enough the risk be that the only business that will survive in this sector will be major chain nursery back by private equity those be the business that can manage economy of scale which will enable they to thrive in most environment there be nothing wrong with those nursery do not wish to suggest that the staff who work in they be anything other than committed or that their owner be work for anything other than the great good however do not want to see small passionate woman own business squeeze out of the sector which might happen that be partly because that be the kind of childcare have for my child in the early year so want it to be an option for all child but it be also partly because in australia when the abc nursery chain go bust family lose their childcare overnight guarantee that it be predominantly woman who do not go to work the next day not those child father consolidated sector be an inherently fragile one as such hope that in the upcoming spending review we will look at the rate that we pay for three and four year old childcare as understand that that be part of what be cause concern also hope we will make sure that our breakfast club place be keep for as long as we can possibly manage and that they be well funded so that their uptake be as we all need it to want to say thank you to all the woman who have inspire both in this chamber and beyond and all those woman who have help most of all though want to say thank you to the woman who look after and the woman who look after my child also thank my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler who be an incredible activist for woman can not express what an honour it be to speak in

history of woman take action against misogyny and inequality and today want to honour that legacy while also shin light on the challenge we still face one of the most remarkable woman from stafford

her activism remind we that change happen when ordinary working class woman take extraordinary action we owe it to alice and the generation before we to continue that fight for equality today however while there be much to be proud of there be also area in which we must act with urgency the statistic on violence against woman and girl be shocking woman be three time more likely to be kill by partner than by not wear seatbelt that be the reality we be deal with and in staffordshire the situation be dire in the past five year staffordshire women aid which be base in my constituency have see increase in referral to its sexual violence service and an increase in referral to its specialist counselling service despite work in the woman and girl sector for year when hear those figure be devastate violence against woman and girl be happen in every corner of this country and firmly believe that it be national emergency in my own casework continue to see woman many with child who be

background and the community and for female member who have disability because they fight fight can not even imagine be surround though by many great male colleague in this place and know that we can not accelerate action or uplift or empower young woman without also engage young man we have to be clear that we can not tackle violence against woman and girl without support young man at this vital point my constituency be not unique in have woman who have be kill by family member or partner and want to take moment to mention horrific case of anju asok who be well love nurse in kettering she be kill alongside her two child in december by her husband anju go to work every day to look after other and support our vital public service but when she need support the most she be let down we have so

male violence against woman some be murder by their own son one in woman kill by man be kill by their own son turn to the urgent issue of funding for specialist domestic abuse service they be lifeline for many survivor but the fact be that they be struggle financially service be stretch underfunde and in some case shut their door we can not accept that many survivor be more likely to turn to they and to have more trust in they than the state and the police so these service must be at the heart of this government mission to halve violence against woman and girl we have to put our money where our mouth be the first step the only independent specialist domestic abuse service in knowsley literally save life commend the chief executive caroline grant and her team on what they do for knowsley she be up in the gallery they be be force to turn woman away however because the stability of funding just be not there that be why have write to the victim minister my hon friend the member for

government be do on this urgent matter we have make incredible progress and have great ambition for woman thank the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend the member for

achievement of our labour party in advance the cause of woman over the last century and to pay particular tribute to the member of the woman section in our labour and trade union movement for the work that they do in their local community yesterday pay lovely visit to our marvellous education centre where meet student from st joseph catholic primary school in billingham in my constituency as always be ask the good and hard question by the student one of those question be what be mp go to do to help woman who play football receive the same pay as man who play football what great question we have hear bit about woman sport today and we be see the rapid growth and transformation of football for woman and girl we have hear about the lioness effect the england woman team have be fantastic role model and on the main stage at wembley under the floodlight they have lay their critic to rest however we should not forget what they have be up against the football association now have ambitious target to grow the girl game but on december the fa meet at its headquarters in london and announce ban on the woman game state that the game of football be quite unsuitable for female and ought not to be encourage before that there be about woman football club attract fan to their game we have to wonder whether the fa be motivate by the fact that the woman game be take fan away from the man

strength to strength and commend the fa for the work that it have do to improve access and opportunity for woman and girl tomorrow to celebrate international women day shall be join pupil at bewley

talented dedicated and hard work woman in parliament include everyone who be speak in today debate our woman member be wonderful role model ahead of international women day we must remember that violence against woman and girl be not inevitable man who kill man who rape and man who abuse and sexually harass do so in the context of an entrenched sex discrimination that normalise male predatory behaviour and quickly blame victim but with sufficient will and change in that context it can and must be end that be why the most welcome change since last year international women day be that we now have labour government as chair of the all party parliamentary group on commercial sexual exploitation have particular interest in prostitution the report from the femicide census whose author clarrie and karen be here today be harrowing but none the less groundbreaking the late report publish yesterday look in detail at complete case of woman kill by man that be on the database that be too many forty five of the woman who have be kill be identify as be involve or have be involve in prostitution but as woman be only include in this cohort if their involvement in prostitution have be explicitly mention in either official document or the medium that be likely to be huge undercount the researcher find that of this cohort woman kill by man in the uk who have be involve in prostitution tend to be young and be less likely to have be bear in the uk than any other woman kill by man and the data show that woman involve in prostitution be also the most vulnerable in society home office report note that approximately of woman involve in prostitution in the uk start be pay for sex act before they be year old while up to of woman involve in street prostitution be believe to be problematic drug user they be indeed the most vulnerable and this not job this be not work woman involve in prostitution be disproportionately victim of violence include fatal violence in their death they be more likely to be subject to sexual violence and after death their body be more likely to be desecrate that be not coincidence prostitution be the old form of sexual exploitation form of violence against woman and girl it be another manifestation of sexual inequality be it not positive development that our government announce this week that young girl would no long be place in young offender institution that be fantastic and it be at the heart of what our ministers be do to support woman and girl all in all woman and girl matter include those who be exploit in the sex trade to

it more important be crucial to eliminate the gender pay gap the employment rights bill which be introduce in the house in october have many provision that will help flexible working will become the default where practical and it will be hard for employer to refuse flexible working request this will allow woman with caring responsibility to balance they more easily with work it will also benefit

talk about the importance of opportunity because it have be restrict over century and we celebrate the smashing of glass ceiling every day whether it be because of legislation lack of right or culture woman access to opportunity have be limit will however give the house particular example that be raise at the conference by oasis our local domestic abuse service it point out that because in thanet we have particularly high level of youth unemployment at about and high level of young people not in education employment or training young woman be be encourage mean force by their boyfriend mean

across the globe international aid have be lifeline and have give they both the security and the access to opportunity that otherwise they be unlikely to have have understand that we be have to make difficult decision and absolutely support increase defence spending simply wish to remind the house of the role of international aid and its impact on woman across the globe we know that of the people

year from my hon friend the minister make those woman visible be important and be part of the struggle to eradicate the violence against and hatred of woman there have be many powerful contribution by hon member across the house this afternoon my contribution will not focus on abuse violence intimidation or even health issue instead would like to speak little about domestic equality and fairness it be an incontrovertible fact that woman have be discriminate against by man for century the historical struggle for equality and fairness that woman have have and continue to have be incredible the fact that it take until for woman to receive equal voting right with man be astounding and it be wrong that it take until the equal pay act to make equal pay compulsory between male and female employee on the issue of pay thank my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler for secure both this debate today and westminster hall debate on pay gap just few week ago in scottish context pay gap be very current issue the scottish trades union congress have show that woman in scotland can expect to see themselves earn an incredible year less than man and the gender pay gap in scotland have rise from in to in this be unfairness in action and show that the fight be very much ongoing as workplace gender inequality be still tolerate in modern society now we be in government labour would do well to heed the political power of woman especially those bear in the because their discontent at pension inequality have become national movement the women against state pension inequality campaign now that we have the power that could correct the injustice suffer by the waspi woman we really should deliver on what be right and deserve credit to the waspi woman they continue to fight against the injustice of which they be victim they be not go away theirs be movement base on the value of fight against discrimination and inequality struggle woman know so well we on the labour benches as socialist and especially my female comrade know that power concede nothing without demand it never have and it never will call the final speaker from the back benches with just very short speech naushabah khan it be pleasure to speak in this international women day debate as the first female mp for gillingham and rainham be surround by so many hard work and drive woman from across the house regardless of the party we represent politic have always be vehicle for smash gender stereotype pull down barrier to entry and forge trailblazer however despite the progress make in our politic there be still work to do as my hon friend the member for kettering rosie wrighting so eloquently outlined and the under representation of woman in certain industry unfortunately extend beyond westminster with real implication for our society and our economic prosperity as nation let we take construction as an example the ons report that as of only of the construction workforce be female when visit midkent college which serve my constituent be inspire by the young woman who be passionate about enter the industry but the reality be that they will be enter sector with low female representation across the board and systemic barrier to career progress our armed force and the defence sector be vital component of the government strategy to deliver economic growth and national security it be therefore critical that woman can look to the military feeling confident about their own career yet we still hear story of those in the military face misogyny harassment and bullying one woman who face sexual harassment take her own life the need to recruit woman and ensure that they stay in our force be challenge for our society and indeed our government look back at our history we see lesson that we can learn from the important effort of female service personnel who be pivotal in the british war effort in world war one world war two and many subsequent conflict indeed one of medway key cultural asset be reminder of such triumph hms cavalier be build solely by woman in only nine month in do not what that say about nine month our investment in our national security need to ensure that we have accessible pathway for woman to join our armed force but also importantly to stay there fulfil their potential and keep britain safe as they always have do recognise that across all these sector significant work have be undertake to address inequality but there be battle to fight on outdated gender stereotype which be impose from young age and go on to have last consequence britain have always be at its good when woman be give the opportunity to excel in their choose pursuit on international women day with its theme of accelerated action remind this house of its obligation to enable woman across the uk to pursue the occupation they be passionate about and create new pathway so that they can realise their ambition call the liberal democrat spokesperson ahead of international women day this saturday want to celebrate woman achievement start by congratulate the hon member for brent east dawn butler on secure this important debate today on be trailblazer for this parliament diversity and on speak so passionately we have make the most amazing progress since the inaugural international women day follow worker right protest in the early century woman in this country can now vote start business or undergo surgery on their own body without consult man the absence of those right might feel faintly ridiculous now but they be hard win in our relatively recent past and we must remember that they do not apply universally across the world we must also recognise that while so much progress have be make give the current global political environment this progress have never feel so precarious this year mark year since jane austen birth in our beautiful hampshire countryside austen novel despite high praise and popularity be publish anonymously and it be her brother who often deal with her publishing negotiation one of her first book be simply write under the authorship by lady as we celebrate world book day today as well it be perfect opportunity to reflect on the endure impact of author such as austen who not only shape our literary world but challenge the societal norm in their time thankfully woman literature in the uk be no long publish anonymously but we still live in world where million girl be out of school million adult woman worldwide can not read or write and woman make up two third of the global illiterate population issue of education and illiteracy will be worsen by the recently announce cut to international aid that policy as highlight by the hon member for east thanet ms billington will disproportionately harm woman we need foreign policy with gender equality at its heart not just because it be the right thing to do but because country that educate girl do well economically for everyone we must also increase international development funding initiative that aim to eradicate sexual violence and abuse in area of conflict the un confirm rise in conflict relate sexual violence between and woman and girl make up of the victim it be not just sexual violence of preventable maternal mortality that amount to about death day occur in crisis affect country and the average incidence of child marriage be high in

stride be be make in the house to improve the life of woman and achieve equality the voyeurism offences act which be originally introduce by my hon friend the member for bath wera hobhouse criminalise upskirte it have be hearten to hear such powerful speech across the house on wide range of topic but woman must also be protect financially right now in the uk woman continue to be economically disadvantaged in the workplace median hourly pay for woman be less than for man and in hampshire that gap almost double the gender pay gap also worsen with age among full time employee age and over the gap widen considerably due to the motherhood penalty that be not fact that we should accept woman deserve well from their workplace and from the societal structure that enable that to continue policy such as increase paternity leave will help woman to have fair share of wage improve policy for woman also improve it for man as the hon member for kettering rosie wrighting say equality benefit

have talk about their live experience about be pregnant and how they be treat as disabled woman about be the young woman in parliament and how they be treat and about be rap and how they have come through that hope that everybody outside the chamber hear that live experience and hear those story and we should never need an excuse question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider international women day political finance rules beg to move that this house recognise that loophole in regulation allow for opaque funding of political party express concern over the prevalence of substantial financial contribution from corrupt individual and foreign government which render political party susceptible to manipulation and undue influence acknowledge the risk these opaque fund pose to national security and the health of our democracy far recognise the need to strengthen the power and independence of regulator to help the regulation of political donation and call on the government to tighten the law on permissible donation to make clear that political party can not accept money from impermissible source or from company that have not make enough money in the uk to fund the amount of their donation or loan before start my remark pay tribute to everything that be say from the dispatch box in the last debate by the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips this house and our government be strong more effective and more compassionate because of her contribution and her work begin by declare an interest be member of political party have spend many year actively involve in party politic as campaigner local councillor and now as member of parliament so know that political party sit at the centre of our political landscape and that they be key pillar in our election and our broad democratic system of course those party need funding to fulfil their day to day function and to contest election our pluralistic democracy depend on lively and active political party that can campaign and engage with the public indeed tomorrow evening will be back out on the doorstep clipboard and leaflet in hand listen to voter and campaign with my local labour party those very activity would be impossible without political donation however far too often the financing of political party involve suspect donation make their way into party coffer and the number be not small research by transparency international find that million in donation almost in every of report donation come from unknown or questionable source between and how have that be allow to happen unfortunately the uk political finance rule design to block foreign donation and dirty money from seep into political party be ripe for abuse and riddle with loophole hostile state actor kleptocrat and international billionaire be easily able to sidestep the uk permissibility rule and funnel money via uk register shell company into our political party as it stand british company be permit to make donation use money raise overseas even if the company have not generate sufficient fund to support that same donation that mean that foreign actor or any mystery donor could legitimately use shell company as conduit to channel money into political party here in the uk this be symbolic of much big problem it should not be that easy to pump money into british politic behind layer of corporate secrecy donation that could come from anyone anywhere pose significant threat to the security and integrity of our democratic system foreign interference in british democracy and election be direct attack on our sovereignty our national interest and our vital democratic institution we have be warn about the problem for many year series of independent review body and the security service have sound the alarm time and again they have make it clear that risk be pose by opaque donation come in from overseas in report by parliament intelligence and security committee identify that multiple member of the russian elite with link to vladimir putin have try to donate or successfully donate to british political party later in warn that an alleged chinese agent have seek to influence parliamentarian on behalf of the chinese communist party in concern be raise in parliament about allege link between the chinese communist party and party fundraising the then minister of state for policing the right hon member for croydon south chris philp note that all political party need to be alert to the danger of representative of hostile state seek to infiltrate or influence their activity official report april vol fear that our unhealthy dependence on handful of large donor also pose risk of undue influence and capture by narrow vested interest we know that of the million of private donation make in alone two third come from mega donor each give well over million just recently one would be mega donor dominate headline for that very reason elon musk the rich man in the world and not british citizen be give serious thought to donate million of pound to british political party reform uk as south african bear billionaire who live in the united states elon musk can not legally make personal donation to british political party but as we know he could easily go through the uk subsidiary of his various company although that rumour have not yet come to pass the risk that it pose to the integrity of our democracy can not be overstate repeat it should not be this easy to pump money into british politic especially from halfway across the world our democratic institution and election should never be the plaything of billionaire who can not even vote in british election and uk register company should not be convenient vehicle to allow they to make such donation even the perception that our political party be capture by those with deep pocket have corrosive effect on public trust in politic and in we as politician at time when that trust be regretfully at historically low level we need to tackle that perception head on and show that our politic be not for sale and can not be unduly influence how do we go about toughening up the rule first we close the loophole have outline once and for all and ensure that company be able to make donation only from profit make in the uk in the last two year as well as introduce requirement for political party to identify the true source of donor fund secondly we need to have tough deterrent for those who break the rule because even if elon musk be ever to breach election law why would he care the maximum fine that the electoral commission can impose be just not even small change to the world rich man unfortunately the previous government only make matter bad when they strip the electoral commission which be task with regulate political finance of its independence and far open the floodgate to mega donation by drastically increase spending limit during election period by around strengthen the rule around donation to political party be manifesto commitment of this new government know that the government and ministers be commit to restore trust and protect british democracy so hope they will act swiftly on that commitment by restore the independence of the electoral commission and empower it to impose much large fine the government should also look closely at cap donation and spending perhaps in line with recommendation put forward by the independent committee on standards in public life smart tweak to exist regulation such as increase fin power lower reporting threshold and cap spending limit do not require primary legislation those change could be enact quickly and still have significant impact on clean up our politic and ensure that our party be all free from suspect donation finally sincerely hope that ministers will look closely at the role that shell company play in allow opaque donation to be make here in the uk often originate from overseas be proud that this labour government be elect on mandate to restore integrity in politic as the prime minister rightly state in his victory speech in the early hour the fight for trust be the battle that define our age wholeheartedly agree with he and look forward to hear from the government and from hon member here today exactly how we can win this crucial battle only by do so can we protect democracy clean up our politic and rebuild trust with the public rise order as member will be able to tell we have considerably more member wish to speak than we have time for so perhaps we will start with an informal time limit of no more than five minute thank the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton for secure this debate on such crucial topic public trust in politic be at an all time low only of people trust political party and only of the population think that political funding be transparent there be clearly problem at the heart of british politic as the hon member say it be particularly bad in our country because we have an electoral commission with very little in the way of tooth or of limit that leave our democracy open to corrosion and dark money which we have to be particularly worried about guard against as the hon member for brent east dawn butler say in the previous debate we must guard our democracy against those anti democratic force and against dark money the influence of money in politic be core part of that corrosion in the uk there be no limit on individual donation that be not the case in canada in france or even in the us why be there no limit on how much money an individual can donate and on how much influence they can therefore exert on british politic corporate donation be allow here but be ban in so many other country foreign donation be theoretically ban here but loophole mean that an individual such as elon musk could quite easily work within exist very bendable rule in order to exert what would undoubtedly be very corrosive influence on our politic the hon member for south dorset mention the electoral commission lack of enforcement power the maximum fine it can impose be yet the influence in our politics total ten of million of pound just over the past decade million have come from unknown source this be clearly serious problem welcome the fact that the current government make manifesto commitment to strengthen the rule on donation to political party in order to protect our democracy from foreign influence very much hope that in she sum up the minister will be able to clarify exactly what that will amount to what action do the government intend to take in order to protect our democracy from foreign influence can she commit to take measure such as strengthen the power of the electoral commission to issue fine reduce the reporting threshold in order to increase transparency and clarify spending limit those measure would not require primary legislation so can the government set out the timetable by which they will bring forward those urgently need measure to protect our democracy big money in politic be corrosive influence this government have the opportunity to put stop to it to bring we up to the standard that other democracy have put in place will the minister set out her timetable for do so and clarify precisely what she will do intend to make short contribution on one particular aspect of political funding that believe be especially corrosive to faith in democracy in our country across north east hertfordshire from buntingford to thundridge local community have work hard to create local neighbourhood plan that be pragmatic but full of hope for the future however time and again those plan be overrule and resident get development that could hardly be further from what they have seek to secure poorly design palpably unsustainable and outrageously overprice so often the reason for this be the enormous financial and political pressure that big developer be able to bring to bear on the debate around the future of our town and village in their relentless pursuit of profit maximisation our constituent will never have faith that our planning system will deliver fair outcome that put nature community life and genuinely affordable home before developer greed for as long as those same developer and the lobbyist they employ be pour vast sum of money into the bank account of political party give the constant clamour for planning deregulation and the already enormous profit that these developer be make it be hard to escape the conclusion that those sum of money have be very wise investment on their part the labour government have inherit the conservative party housing crisis we must not inherit the same issue of influence that plague the previous administration trust in politic will return only when we make our position unimpeachable and the future of development in our town village and countryside be too important even to appear to have be subvert on behalf of private interest if we want the public to believe that the planning guideline that we set nationally and locally will be fairly adhere to it be my contention that we must ban all political donation from developer those who work for they and the lobbyist they employ thank the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton for secure this important debate the lack of transparency in the funding of our political party be well document although suspect not so well know among member of the public who tend to associate the corrupting influence of money in politic with other country usually very far away the reality be that it be take place on our doorstep accord to research do by transparency international almost in every report by political party and their member since have come from unknown or questionable source some million come from donor allege or prove to have be involve in other corruption fraud or money laundering and million come from unincorporated association that have not report the source of their income despite parliament introduce new transparency rule in the rest of its finding highlight million from donor allege or prove to be intermediary for foreign fund hidden source and million from company that have not make sufficient profit to support the political contribution they have make other research have confirm that successive government have invest trillion in the defence industry our new government be also propose to increase defence spending to and then to the defence industry be reportedly responsible for approximately of all corruption worldwide and much of the money that we and other country spend in defence be funnel back through opaque channel into political party and member the industrial military complex need to be investigate and dismantle the fact be that our political finance rule be too weak on hidden money make the system vulnerable to subordination from rich individual and secretive vested interest my constituent and people from our country be concern by the malign influence on government policy of party governments and opposition members and other members accept million from state and industry lobby corporation and mega rich donor the hon member be make case do he agree that foreign money have no role in our democracy and that one of the strong way in which we can clean up our politic and indeed strengthen our democracy be to make sure that the electoral commission have real tooth and have high fin power do he also agree that where we have concern about foreign money come into our country we should have particular concern about money come from people such as elon musk completely agree with the hon member the action that the electoral commission should be permit to take should not just be limit to big great fine for donor there should be consequence for those accept donation and potentially be influence my constituent and the people of this country see and feel in their daily life the deep impact of pro rich pro war anti poor and anti consumer decision and policy the solution lie in reform to tighten spending rule to shine light on the source of financial contribution to lower spending limit to reduce campaign cost and reliance on large donation to introduce donation cap of year for individual and organisation as recommend by the committee on standards in public life to remove the corrupting influence of big money in politic and to close loophole to ensure that overseas trip for parliamentarian be fund only by trust source the uk use to lead the way on funding transparency the uk be found member of the open government partnership and place third in the oecd open datum index but in recent year the uk have slip the most recent oecd ranking see the uk fall to place with story about dodgy dealing personal protective equipment procurement and minister disappear whatsapp message all contribute to the decline in the trust that the public place in their politician as have be mention it should be cause for grave concern that of the million of private donation in alone two third come from donor give more than million each the high ever share of mega donation if we do not want our politic to go the way of american politic with british equivalent to the like of elon musk and his fellow tech billionaire blatantly use money to buy influence and remake politic in their own interest we need tight regulation of political finance than we currently have and full transparency for the public thank my fellow dorset resident my hon friend the member for south dorset lloyd hatton for secure this important debate it go to the heart of the concern that the public have namely that economic dominance lead to political influence money be use to influence politic and politic be then use to enable those people to make more money through change in law or regulation this be the issue that worry the public we also know that civic participation diminish if people feel that they have no influence compare to those with large amount of money public trust in our political system be at an all time low that flow in part from sense that politician be unable properly to represent those who elect they that money in our politics exert undue influence that be often obscure from public view and that those who break the rule that do exist be not adequately punish nearly of the public think that funding of political party be not transparent and only think that political party that break the rule will face any action that be why labour manifesto make the welcome pledge to establish new independent ethics and integrity commission with its own independent chair to ensure probity in government the commission must be empower to challenge the corrupting influence of not only the developer lobby but other big money donor include those from the oil and gas industry we should also close loophole to ensure that overseas trip for parliamentarian be fund only by trust source and publish clear guidance on the acceptance of gift and hospitality it be worry too that uk political party be rely increasingly on small number of extremely wealthy people to bankroll their election campaign the last government increase national campaign spending limit from million to million which have intensify the demand for donation across all our political party as the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed say early transparency international uk claim that between and may million come from donor allege or prove to have be involve in corruption fraud or money laundering political party should therefore be require by law to identify the true source of fund as part of risk base approach to donation and donation from company should not be allow to exceed its net profit generate in the uk within the precede two year uk register company be permit to make donation use money raise overseas which be why political party should be require to conduct check on donation to assess and manage their risk there be real concern about unincorporated association such association be not require to check that those who donate to they be permissible which mean that they could legitimately make donation use funding from otherwise impermissible source include from overseas as other member have say the electoral commission should therefore be give power to investigate candidate compliance with the rule and to impose sanction finally ban company that win public contract from make political donation would end the potential conflict of interest that this create and the perception that political friend have receive political favour congratulate the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton on secure this debate and thank the backbench business committee for grant it as the prime minister declare last year and as we see so graphically on the world stage now the fight for trust will be the battle that define our political era official report july vol it be clear that if we mps be to achieve the change that people need most in their life we need function democracy if those we represent do not trust politician to act in their good interest we will not be an effective institution currently it be simply not the case that they trust we both in the uk and across the globe faith in politic and politician be at an all time low in the uk of people have little to no trust in member of this house up from decade ago note with no great relish that this may not be surprising after year of conservative government who be more concerned with their internal politic than the concern of people around the country but it should be deep concern for we all rebuild trust in politic be the goal regardless of our political colour or persuasion be sure that all member of the house can support that but it will not happen overnight research from the electoral commission show that only of people agree that there be transparency around the money spend and receive by party and campaigner down from over third in we should be clear that political donation be not inherently wrong and be part of vibrant democratic system individual should be able to take part in the democratic process through political donation which can help people to further the goal and ideal that they believe in ban any donation would entrench power leave new or small party unable to campaign against incumbent it would work against many of our democratic principle but it be clear that although political donation be good thing we must have adequate transparency as to the source of the money that be currently not the case the legal framework for the political finance system be now over year old and though it be explicitly intend to ban foreign donation to uk political party there be clearly many loophole there be no doubt that foreign nation have an interest in alter our politic dictator such as putin and xi jinping have make it perfectly clear that they do not believe in democracy and be willing to undermine our institution but our current system have build in loophole that allow foreign interest to channel money to our politic to shape it in their interest at present uk register company be permit to make donation use money raise overseas and as have be say previously unincorporated association can legitimately make donation use funding from otherwise impermissible donor it be not just foreign donation that should cause concern the sheer amount of money come from small number of extremely wealthy donor be also worry of the million receive in private donation in alone two third come from just donor money help direct the political wind and have that amount of money come from such small number of powerful individual risk bring our democratic system into disrepute we must introduce cap on donation no matter how noble the intention no individual should be able to donate excessively as large donation can at the very least give the impression that undue influence be be exercise over our democracy this would not only be positive step in clean up politic it would be popular too recent yougov poll find that more than two third of the british public support limit on political donation personally also have concern about the capacity of union baron to exercise what might appear to be undue influence via the vast amount of money accumulate through the political levy which they can donate or withhold as they see fit however acknowledge that the issue be complex we be at crucial juncture and it be in everyone interest that the government get proper handle on this issue we can not enter the next general election with so many question leave unanswered call stella creasy with four minute time limit thank you madam deputy speaker like everybody in the chamber must be sure to draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests follow the money be one of those phrase we always hear as if there be somehow crush inevitability that money determine outcome in all area of life whether personal or political but now in our democracy there be clear and present danger that the loud voice and large wallet will dominate and that the two be connect even in these difficult political clime it be extraordinary to think that the existential threat to our country democracy pose by the suggestion that elon musk could donate million to any political party here have not cause cobra meeting to be call because it be national security threat foreign agent who be now part of the structure of foreign state be openly talk about interfere in our democracy buy it and boast about do so and he be not the only one guess that for many the idea that politics be so infused with money be not surprise after all we have be try for over year to regulate foreign donation and indeed local donation in this country for the avoidance of doubt donate to political party be noble thing for people to do give the concern and passion they may have and we in this chamber have all seek donation however we have see scandal through the year start with david lloyd george and include the cash for question affair and the personal protective equipment issue time and again transparency international have draw our attention to the current datum on this and that be before we even get to taylor swift because she be right it you hi we be the problem as politician we have not regulate this even though we have see these problem time and again in the short time available to want to make plea to the minister to ensure she be look at the impact at local level when money be channel through unincorporated organisation many of we will have see the impact in our community and our constituency and frankly the failure of the crown prosecution service and the police to intervene in america group be create primarily to influence the selection nomination election or appointment of candidate at local level and many of we now have third party organisation that be active in our local community and try to create disinformation to disrupt our local democracy people may ask what the problem be in my constituency because have substantial majority but give that one in five mp have majority of less than these activity fake leaflet third party advert on facebook and so on could be critical to the outcome of local and indeed national election we have gag law for charity but we have nothing to deal with the business that be behind this and that be fund these activity it be grave irony to that many of we come here yesterday to defend aid as part of national security work because part of our aid budget go on tackle disinformation and disruption in the democracy of other country but we be not do anything about it at local level just the other week the guardian report that network of telegram channel with russian link be encourage uk resident to commit violent attack on mosque and offer cryptocurrency in return these activity be also happen online as we have all see the online be now the offline threat and vice versa we see that with cambridge analytica and nobody really act then member be right about the scale of the challenge with regulation and fine but we need to do something about the fact that much more pressure can be bring to bear on mps at local level because the result have be much close this be not some netflix drama this be the state of british democracy at the moment everybody in this chamber have vested interest in resolve it so that we can have free speech look forward to hear what the minister have to say thank my hon friend the member for south dorset lloyd hatton who play an instrumental role in the all party parliamentary group on anti corruption and responsible tax for secure this important debate be really proud to stand on manifesto commitment to strengthen the rule on donation to political party and welcome the government commitment to bring forward an election bill in due course hope today debate will help inform what be in that future bill because as other have say restore trust in our political system and ensure that everyone have voice in the decision that affect their life be absolutely crucial to british democracy we know from international evidence the risk of allow ever increase amount of money to dominate politic live in washington dc for almost year and see at first hand the impact of that system include the world rich man spend quarter of billion dollar to bankroll the last election when billionaire and corporate interest drown out the voice of everyone else we should not be surprised that people lose faith in democracy work for they it continue to amaze that representative of reform who unsurprisingly have not turn up for this debate seem eager to take that approach to politic they preach populism on the one hand while court foreign billionaire and their policy agenda on the other that be not in keep with british value but this be also about place such as moldova and other country where we have see russian operative ship money in to buy election we should not be complacent other member have cover the threat to the uk and would like to pay tribute to transparency international uk spotlight on corruption and all the other great organisation help to shine light on the issue will move on swiftly to some area on which hope the minister will consider reform transparency company donation the electoral commission and cap on transparency unincorporated association as we have hear be particularly vulnerable to abuse since over million have come through unincorporated association and we have no idea where of that money come from as it stand they be not require to check that those who donate to they be permissible so they could be foreign donor they be easy to set up we do not know who be behind they and there be no transparency requirement in law for donation to candidate as oppose to political party or campaigner hope that in future election bill the government will introduce reform to clamp down on those loophole include provision on identify people responsible for unincorporated association permissibility check for political donation and low reporting threshold we have already hear that company donation be big issue fully endorse the proposal make on the issue by my hon friend the member for south dorset thirdly we need robust independent oversight and to restore the independence of the electoral commission we need an urgent review of the requirement for the commission to submit strategy and policy statement to the government believe that be part of an entirely confect agenda on voter fraud in the elections act hope we will repeal that as soon as possible finally believe it be now time to consider cap on political donation the previous government massive increase in spending limit and the increase reliance on major donor have convince that well enforce cap would be healthy for our democracy this be an issue that should unite we as house it be about the health of our democracy there be lot more we need to do vote at automatic voter registration improve citizenship education and ensure citizen have voice between election and not just at they but on this particular issue with trust so low it be vital that we act urgently last week give two really clear reminder about why this issue matter first speak with my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell at rally to mark the illegal invasion of ukraine we see frank reminder of authoritarianism right on our doorstep then on thursday the labour party lose by election in vincent square while do not like that result one bit be very proud to live in country where community can come together and make decision about who represent they we currently see more of that sort of politic in this country with people able to go out to the polling station but sadly we be at real risk of see it decline we can not ignore the fact that there be force intent on weaken our voice our vote and our right in the medium in business and in politic and that they be co ordinating to replace democratically elect regime with those that would do their bidding these force be spread conspiracy theory which have drive division and violence in our community they give platform to those who would question fundamental british value and they undermine the democratic process as they question free and fair election around the world this be not question of competition within our democracy but of democracy itself we need to preserve system where the voter be the one choose their leader not billionaire autocrat keep their money out of our politic be become difficult task our finance flow be become more elusive with cryptocurrency enable money laundering at scale and our politic have grow demand for more cash with ever grow competition for voter attention what member have not have to struggle with an inscrutable ring doorbell or security gate understandable change to home security and design have real impact on our political finance as we spend more and more money try to reach voter through online ad and direct mail however get this money out of our politic be more important than ever at time when trust in politic be at an all time low politician must be effective natural communicator as well as thoughtful legislator and even the suspicion that we might not be act in our constituent interest will far erode the trust that voter do have in their representative fix political finance be therefore an essential part of restore faith in democracy we have already hear that tenth of the money in our politic come from unknown or questionable source and be donate through loophole in exist law now we have to come to the solution enforcement be make more difficult by loophole and weak enforcement system company house reporting rule be too loose while the electoral commission lack the independence to investigate potential breach swiftly and thoroughly report obligation for party elect official and candidate require tighten up as they allow some individual candidate to accept money without report meanwhile the disincentive for bad behaviour such as fine be set well below the level that would impact bad actor we need to close the loophole around unincorporated association open up political party to great transparency and give more power to enforcement entity we can not take for grant that voter will always be able to speak truth to power and we need to fight to preserve system where british election be decide only by british voter the force of foreign interference be knock at our door and we need our ring doorbell more than ever as colleague have do already congratulate my hon friend the member for south dorset lloyd hatton on secure this debate rise to speak as someone who dedicate almost year of my work life before come to this place to be an anti corruption professional it be an issue that go to the heart of our politic so it be somewhat disappointing to see that no back bench members from the official opposition be present to speak in this debate this be vital issue on which we need to build consensus across party line we have hear about low turnout at election which as think we all know tear at the very fabric of our society corrode democracy and the social contract between the citizen and the state foreign political donation might well be ban in the uk but the current restriction be far too easy for determined actor to circumvent in response we must be bold in reform our outdated oversight of political donation the risk pose by foreign interference plague all our party although it be not just about one person individual or party have take the liberty of rake back through donation of year past to illustrate my argument indeed just before the election the bureau of investigative journalism make what should have be impermissible donation to all six major party all but one labour fail to correctly identify that the donation could not be accept under current rule and return the money elsewhere the intelligence and security committee report on russian interference make it clear that russian money have be use not just to buy up sprawling mansion but to attempt to buy influence in our politic we have see lubov chernukhin the wife of former putin minister donate more than million to the conservative party one might ask what do million buy well in return lubov be award with tennis match with boris johnson and dinner with liz truss and theresa may they pick up the bill presumably let we also take the case of oligarch alexander temerko who run russian state arm company and have cough up more than separately we know that the russian state and its proxy have well document history of interfere in the politic of other country and subvert hard win democracy whether that be in the united states france or moldova as my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell mention we should not be so arrogant as to assume that britain be immune to this interference so what can we do first hope that we will see an election bill in the next session which would provide golden opportunity to close the loophole we have hear about today give the regulator real power and safeguard our democracy against foreign influence if the minister be look for inspiration she need only look to organisation such as spotlight on corruption transparency international uk as well as the electoral commission itself we should include proposal around make sure that we introduce know your donor kyd introduce such rule would require party themselves to conduct proper check on the source of donation where that can not be establish the party themselves will be require to reject that money secondly we should close the current loophole in our donation system that allow donation from shell company that have never even turn profit in the uk thirdly we must crack down on unincorporated association such as the carlton club which can channel donation to political candidate some unincorporated association have become opaque slush fund to channel money into politic allow money from undisclosed foreign source to trickle into our election campaign if we fail to act and send clear message we undermine democracy and trust in our politic we must not allow that to happen and urge the minister to be bold call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton for his work in secure this important debate and member from across the house for their contribution this afternoon the liberal democrats support this motion which align with our long stand stance on political finance reform and protect democracy from foreign influence we have long call for reform to prevent foreign interference and increase the transparency in political donation we support strengthen the electoral commission by restore its independence and increase its enforcement power include high fine for breach of political finance law our democracy should never be up for sale to foreign billionaire oligarchs or hostile state and as such we support this motion which acknowledge some of those risk the liberal democrats will continue to push for strong measure to protect our political and electoral system we want to take big money out of politic by cap donation to political party be proud that my hon friend the member for stratford on avon manuela perteghella present bill in this house to do just that and we want to enhance regulatory power to protect british democracy from the unprecedented threat pose by foreign interference and attack on our democracy liberal democrats will make protect our democracy national security priority we be see record level of disillusionment with the political process with citizen become increasingly disengage research from the electoral commission highlight significant drop in the rate of public confidence in political finance transparency fall from in to about today it have also recently point out the threat of foreign influence on social medium highlight the rise in misinformation and artificial intelligence deepfake in the run up to the general election in july last year as well as new issue arise from the change to fact check on popular website public trust in our electoral process be not help by the disastrous record of the former conservative government it be not just their successive sleaze scandal which create crisis of democracy in this country or their exorbitant voter id scheme which disproportionately disenfranchise the young and those from ethnic minority community but their shameful decision to weaken the independence of the electoral commission and that be decision that will go down in ignominy if we be to strengthen our democratic safeguard and correspondingly strengthen public trust in our democracy that have to start with empower the electoral commission that be why we need to reverse the conservatives change we want to strengthen the electoral commission by repeal the government power to designate strategy and policy statement for the commission the former conservative government also fail to take the threat pose by russia seriously they be content to allow russian money to flood into the uk and also to allow russian money to flow into the coffer of their own party and the manner in which boris johnson let the russia report sit on his desk be shocking when that report be finally publish it lay bare the extent to which russia be threat include to our democratic institution the report say the uk be clearly target for russia disinformation campaign and political influence operation and must therefore equip itself to counter such effort it call russian influence in the uk the new normal and say that the government have underestimate the response require to the russian threat we continue to call for the full publication of the unredacted report the russian government have be accuse of orchestrate widespread campaign of interference and disinformation that seek to undermine the global order in september the head of and the cia jointly warn that the international order be under threat in way not see since the end of the cold war accuse russia of reckless campaign of sabotage across europe hope that the minister share my concern that this week united states defence secretary hegseth have announce the step back of us counter cyber measure against russia that be an incredibly concern decision by the americans which threaten not only their cyber security but our own will she update the house on what measure the uk be take to step up our defence of our democratic institution we will continue to urge the government to designate protect our democracy as national security priority turn to foreign oligarch it would be remiss of not to mention elon musk let we recall that just week before musk become us government official he suggest that america should liberate the people of britain and overthrow the uk government hope that other party will join the liberal democrats in unequivocally condemn such remark that incident far prove that we urgently need to tighten up political funding that include cap on big donation we must prevent foreign oligarch from be able to interfere in our democracy the liberal democrats want to take big money out of politic by cap donation to political party and we support the motion fair cap will ensure that politic serve our constituent and not big money over two third of the british public support cap on political donation we must deliver the reform that people be demand call the shadow minister will start with confession be one of the reader of the guardian on the conservative benches and pay tribute to the helpful article it publish today with the late update of what have be happen in the world of political donation it illustrate that despite the increase in spending limit set out in the previous parliament the spend at the last general election reduce as political party on all side rein in their spending the article also set out in some detail the fundraising effort of the party in the chamber and help to put some of the figure quote in public debate into context while there may be those promising to donate million to british political party the party in question manage to raise over that quarter which be approximately an eighth of the fund raise by my party and bit less than quarter of the fund raise by the labour party over the same period as dedicated fan of private eye it be clear to that the transparency bring by the reporting of these donation be enormously helpful indeed it have lead to many of the contribution to the debate on the whole the debate have be positive by and large avoid much of the casting of aspersion we often see and focus on the practicality have some brief point to make and then some question to put to the minister that be very much about the practicality of take forward the work that be under way first there be the need to respond as political party and state to the evolve roster of challenge that we face we know that practice be be import from the united states such as the funding of issue base campaign which have enormous political impact include on the election of politician but be not donation to specific political party the opposition would clearly be keen to work with the government to ensure that donation for political purpose without be to political party be open to the appropriate level of scrutiny loophole have recently be create by the decision of labour in wales and the snp in scotland to extend the franchise to great proportion of foreign citizen allow they to vote in british election because the principle that underpin report be that people can donate to political party only in an election where they be also able to vote the fact that two area of our country have different rule on that enable such citizen to donate to those party because the political party there operate nationally that be loophole and an issue that hope the government will be address political finance be see not just in the form of donation to political party but in the lobbying to which number of hon member refer the trip and the research input in the last parliament there be the lobby scandal that revolve around chinese spy donate about to labour party organisation that be reflect in the challenge that have come from opposition members to the government position on the chinese embassy while the government may feel that it be legitimate foreign policy objective to cosy up to china many member across party express the view that the influence of china in british politic be significant concern let put some question to the minister first why have the government choose to abandon the commitment make by parliament and the last government in the national security act to enhance the power so that regulator law enforcement and security service could share information with political party that process would have specifically help to avoid the kind of situation that occur with labour chinese spy problem by enable party to be more informed about who the individual be who be come forward will the government take step to close the loophole create by the labour welsh government and the snp scottish government that for the first time allow russian chinese and iranian citizen resident in those country to donate to uk wide politician and political party why have the minister choose not to include china in the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme while we recognise that the government be pursue great trade with china which be legitimate political expectation be that not green light to the chinese communist party to enhance the degree of influence it seek to transact in british politic do the minister and do the government accept that uk politician themselves be low risk it be important that we be here have this debate and seek the high possible standard in the past we see gold plating with the politically expose person rule that see parliamentarian on all side of the chamber be deprive of access to basic financial service do the minister believe that we need to remove the risk of genuine legitimate uk politician be debanke because of their political view finally and perhaps most importantly in the context of the need to maintain consensus why be the government fail to consult the political party on their plan for change to political finance law contrary to the precedent set by past administration of all party do the minister accept the long stand convention that the government of the day do not unilaterally seek to impose measure affect political finance to their own partisan advantage will she undertake that there will be discussion with the parliamentary parties panel and that there will be formal consultation with the party will there be discussion through the so call usual channel or on privy council term that way we can ensure that in the context of electoral law that be complex and for good reason to protect the integrity of our democracy we can retain cross party confidence that those rule be not be use by the government in pursuit of their own political advantage thank my hon friend the member for south dorset lloyd hatton for open this debate and congratulate the backbench business committee and its key member on grant this debate be extremely grateful to hon member for their insight and excellent contribution all of which be incredibly valuable as we make progress on such an important agenda have hear real passion and conviction in today speech in those powerful speech in defence of our democracy our desire to protect it from those who would distort and disrupt it be clear the uk democratic system have evolve over time to create stable and adaptable political ecosystem with strong institution that be rightly hold as exemplar the world over we can be proud of our historic commitment to expand democratic right and make our system more representative and inclusive we must not be complacent however democracy be hard won and fragile the price of our democracy be eternal vigilance and nowhere be that truer than in campaign finance and political funding this government be commit to strengthen our democracy and ensure full participation in our election we will set out the government approach to election and electoral reform for this parliament in publish document before the summer recess effective regulation of political finance be crucial in maintain public trust in our electoral system and that point be well make today in the speech by hon member the uk have strong political finance framework that make it clear that only those with legitimate interest in uk election can make political donation foreign money have no place in the uk political system which be why the law be clear that foreign donation be not permit with the exception of donation from certain irish source to northern ireland political party that recognise the special place of ireland in the political life and culture of northern ireland and be consistent with the principle set out in the belfast good friday agreement accept or facilitate an illegitimate foreign donation be rightly criminal offence political party be require by law to take reasonable step to verify the identity of donor and whether they be permissible and there be rule that safeguard against impermissible donation through the back door while it be clear that foreign donation to political party and other campaigner be illegal the government recognise the continue risk pose by actor who seek to interfere with and undermine our democratic process point well make by number of hon member we do not think that the current rule provide strong enough safeguard that be why the government commit in their manifesto to protect democracy by strengthen the rule around donation to political party include enhanced safeguard against foreign donation we be consider series of policy intervention such as enhanced check by recipient of donation and tight control on donor include more restriction around company donation hon member have mention the important role that the electoral commission play in the uk democratic system as the regulator of political finance robust regulation and enforcement of political finance rule be crucial for promote public confidence and trust in democratic process ensure integrity and combat the threat of foreign interference as part of deliver on our commitment to strengthen the rule around political donation we be review whether any change be require to the role and power of the regulator to ensure that enforcement provide clear deterrent against break the law while remain proportionate the government be develop proposal to give effect to those commitment in the meantime assure hon member that we be carefully consider evidence from wide range of stakeholder include recommendation from the public administration and constitutional affairs committee the committee on standards in public life and the electoral commission at its core that work be about protect the integrity of our democratic process it be therefore vital that we remain responsive to the full range of threat to our democracy and continue our effort on the related issue of election security and preparedness work across government with the intelligence agency the devolve government the police and external partner the government will continue to monitor and respond to emerge issue such as protective security cyber threat as well as misinformation and disinformation be pleased to hear the minister say that the government be awake to the evolve nature of the threat especially in cyber and on social medium platform one of the thing that hope they look at be the various way that social medium can be use to directly or indirectly benefit political party the defend democracy taskforce chair by the home secretary alongside the deputy prime minister be very much look at those issue my hon friend talk about the evolve nature of the threat member on both side of the house have speak of elon musk and feel compel to do so too this be man who when our country be go through riot say that we be on the verge of civil war this be man who say that one of our own ministers should be put in jail be she able to say for the record that that be exactly the type of person who we need to investigate and that his money have no place in our politic it be crucial that we focus on ensure that our democracy and its integrity be protect from interference and that we have public confidence and that be our focus instead of go into specific individual case my focus be on ensure that we build trust in our system and protect our democracy against interference and political finance be key part of that in closing thank hon member from across the house for their contribution to this important debate which be rich with suggestion and idea as we make progress in the come month very much look forward to work with colleague across party to ensure that we take the necessary action we want robust vibrant and representative democracy and that mean fight foreign interference and unfair funding look forward to bring

phil brickell for outline robustly the risk pose by russian oligarch and their dirty money we must stand up against it before bring my remark to close gently say to the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed that this be an important discussion think we all agree on that but we must always be drive by fact and evidence oversimplify the argument mean that we will not get the right outcome believe that one can support policy such as increase defence spending to without somehow be in hock to or in the pocket of the military industrial complex as he put it that be gross oversimplification and gently remind he of that finally thank the minister for her contribution welcome the government commitment to set out their thinking on this important issue later this year thank she for reconfirm that foreign donation have no place in british politic and for make it clear that the government agree about the need for strong safeguard the electoral commission will play

receive signature present this petition from constituent of huntingdon and north bedfordshire who will be impact by the propose east park energy solar farm the proposal announce by brockwell storage and solar to build solar farm know as east park energy which will at acre be big than gatwick airport have cause great concern among resident in the parish of hail weston great staughton little staughton keysoe and pertenhall the development have be designate nationally significant infrastructure project and be be build on farmland of which be grade as good and most versatile land grade and grade the propose solar farm stand to have significant impact on local life as photovoltaic panel be instal on pile drive metal post the site have even be build on top of roman town that have be identify but not excavate local resident feel that their voice in opposition to the scale of the project be foist upon they have not be hear and that the government be unprepared to listen to they the

house of commons urge the government to not approve the east park energy proposal and to take immediate action to remove its nationally significant infrastructure project status and the petitioner remain etc geothermal energy motion make and question propose that this house do now dixon be grateful to have be grant this adjournment debate as it provide welcome opportunity to put on the record in this new parliament the benefit that deep geothermal could deliver for our country in particular for part of our country that most need investment while make contribution to the vital issue of energy security help in this effort be the all party parliamentary group on deep geothermal which the association for renewable energy and clean technology help to administer be delighted to spot the hon member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham for camborne and redruth perran moon and for rushcliffe james naish in the chamber who be all member of the appg which provide with an opportunity to recognise and thank they for the work they be do for the cause deep geothermal energy remain an underutilise resource in the uk despite its potential to provide reliable renewable heat in particular and also power with grow pressure to secure our energy future and decarbonise heating now be the time to give this technology the attention it deserve as we work towards energy security and decarbonisation we must explore every viable renewable energy source deep geothermal offer stable and sustainable solution yet it remain largely untapped in the uk to unlock its potential the government must take the lead provide the necessary support to get project off the ground and demonstrate their long term viability one of the big challenge we face in the journey to net zero be the decarbonisation of heating which must be treat as priority the uk have more than million home and million other building include office hospital shop and warehouse the vast majority of which rely on gas boiler for both heating and hot water these building alone account for nearly one fifth of the uk total emission the climate change committee have identify decarbonise heat as one of the most difficult yet essential step in reach net zero achieve net zero by require we to use every tool at our disposal while much of the government attention have be focus on air and ground source heat pump alongside other electrification method which have an important and certainly dominant role to play convert the entire housing stock to those technology will put immense pressure on our electricity grid and supply chain that be where deep geothermal stand out it offer reliable low carbon solution for heating that be not dependent on sun or wind it be there all year round whatever the weather and have be successfully deploy in other country to great effect do the hon member agree that geothermal as baseload energy source that can be develop quickly should be include in the government clean power plan and have the priority that that afford for grid connection fully support the hon member effort to raise this issue she will know from the local project in her constituency that we be make start but it be not enough and this need to be part of the broad plan in comprehensive way when first learn about deep geothermal technology think it sound too good to be true an environmentally friendly reliable and cost effective source of heat and power right underneath our foot but the more explore it the more realise it truly live up to its promise let briefly explain the technology deep geothermal tap into naturally occur hot water deep underground to produce significant amount of usable heat and energy make use of that be no different from the way in which the romans build their bath above hot spring we just run pipe down instead of rely on the water make its own way to the surface people sometimes wonder whether the technology be fracke mark fracke involve the use of high pressure to crack the rock to create artificial flow like europe we have access to resource of naturally flow water that simply need to be tap greenpeace friends of the earth and the united nations all support deep geothermal in the light of its environmental benefit site be typically to acre it do not take up huge swathe of farmland like solar panel can or involve erect wind turbine which some community think detract from the local landscape thank the hon member for give we the opportunity to discuss the potential of geothermal and the barrier when it come to planning in my constituency of camborne redruth and hayle we have business that be at the forefront of both shallow geothermal energy with ground source heat pump develop by kensa and deep geothermal system such as those be pioneer by the geothermal engineering ltd deep geothermal power project which be soon to become operational do he agree that industry need government support include plan reform to reduce deployment timescale and uk geothermal licensing scheme to calculate the size of the geothermal asset and how that asset be protect in law agree with the hon member the government need an entire strategy for deep geothermal that will hopefully draw attention to those different piece of the puzzle include planning and licensing which be so important not too far away from his constituency be the eden project which people see as byword for environmental credential in this country it be pioneer this technology which be powerful testimony to its environmental benefit since the closure of the non domestic renewable heat incentive in unfortunately just as interest be peak from industry deep geothermal unlike solar and wind in their early beginning have be without comprehensive government support to develop the market there have be encourage breakthrough as be mention and in the uk first operational deep geothermal plant to open in year go online at the eden project deep geothermal also make its historic debut in allocation round of contract for difference with three project from geothermal engineering ltd securing approval total mw of capacity at langarth garden village green heat network funding be now support the development of geothermal power heat network to turn that resource into local supply those success show that with the right backing geothermal can become key player in our transition to clean sustainable energy however those ad hoc win be not provide the sort of comprehensive dedicated approach that we need as it stand the uk have fall far behind other country that have for some time harness the potential of deep geothermal if we look across europe as of there be project in france in the netherlands and in germany deep geothermal energy heat more than quarter of million home in paris and the french government aim to increase the number of scheme by by munich be pour in billion through to to develop deep geothermal and make the city heating carbon neutral in fact germany be already produce more than mw annually and the government be target at least new geothermal project across europe alone hot sedimentary aquifer have the potential to provide eight terawatt of heat at time more than the district heating system that currently serve million people across the region the potential be enormous would be look on badly if do not briefly mention the british geological survey which be base in my constituency the hon member talk about what be happen in europe but do he agree that in the british geological survey in this country we have one of the world expert in study geology and geothermal technology which could help unlock what we be do in this country with deep geothermal the hon member be right and join he in pay tribute to the bgs an organisation have have the pleasure of work with over recent year it have do fantastic work in mapping and identify the potential and with funding it will have the appetite to go even far reduce uncertainty by help developer and investor to understand the resource underneath our foot the uk be already world leader in tackle climate change and clean energy have be the first major economy to halve our emission and renewable now account for more than of our electricity up from just in with deep sedimentary basin in east yorkshire and cheshire granite in cornwall and scotland hot sedimentary aquifer in surrey dorset and sussex in my constituency the uk unique geography put we in an ideal position to exploit the benefit of geothermal energy be grateful for the work that the hon member have do in this area york have rich source of deep geothermal the york central site could heat home in my constituency yet the local authority and other body do not have the confidence to bring those project on board do he agree that the government could provide tool and support to enable such project to come to fruition as well as just improve basic understanding the hon member be completely right forgive she be also member of the appg although do not recognise that at the start of my remark one thing we can do through the appg we start to do this in the last parliament and be try to reconstitute it be to help interested local authority form group and support they this technology be new to they and they do not necessarily have the expertise and understanding again the hon member be right these be the sort of thing that comprehensive government lead strategy could help to address close the gap as say the resource in europe and the rock that be be exploit be essentially exactly the same vein of rock that cross the channel there be no geological difference and no less potential than with the rock that be be exploit in europe it be true that the heat and rock necessary for deep geothermal electricity be rare here in the uk with cornwall lead the field which be where the project mention be get off the ground but historically the focus on electricity have cause we to overlook the potential for heat the association for renewable energy and clean technology rea work with arup to assess the uk potential they estimate that the uk could support geothermal plant produce gw of heat each year which could supply heating to over million home through heat network additionally some of those plant could generate around gw of electricity annually enough to power further home the minister will be look closely at secure the good possible value for money from every penny invest in renewable technology but want to make four point about the way in which this exercise should be undertake because too narrow framework would underestimate the benefit of deep geothermal to our economy overall first as allude to early solar and wind be cheap now but they do not use to be and we need to think about the potential trend cost secondly as mention deep geothermal be baseload unlike solar and wind and that have to be give due consideration thirdly there be the question of where the investment will end up have the opportunity to work with the durham energy institute as part of national review into deep geothermal for the previous government we identify that deep geothermal can play key role in level up with six of the least economically resilient local authority also have the high geothermal potential some of the list of high potential location for deep geothermal fall within the top uk local authority in need of level up three time the amount that we would expect as result of chance invest in the sector would create thousand of well pay job and drive green growth in area that need it most fourthly deep geothermal provide natural transition for oil and gas worker as many skill such as drilling be directly transferable oil and gas company sometimes uk company be deliver these project across europe surely this be the obvious industry to invest in to protect those job and business as we transition how might we go far in the short term have work with the industry to develop ready make plan ask the minister to look closely at the proposal that the appg have produce to create carve out in the public sector decarbonisation scheme to unlock this opportunity the psd scheme have already play crucial role in help public sector building transition to low carbon heating solution however specific programme could be carve out to support an initial cohort of deep geothermal project ensure that school hospital and other public building can benefit from this reliable renewable heat source by do so the government would not only accelerate the decarbonisation of public infrastructure but provide strong foundation for the wide geothermal industry to scale up and attract investment have speak in the chamber before about how hospital be fantastic anchor candidate for deep geothermal plant industry leader have identify that of the nhs hospital in england and wales that have be prioritise for decarbonisation due to their high heat demand overlie potential geothermal aquifer the advantage of work across the nhs be that we can bundle up opportunity to create big investment opportunity know that hospital across the country be already explore this include eastbourne district general hospital which service my constituent in bexhill and battle one of the challenge for deep geothermal be scale of cost and uncertainty solar and wind be cheap and more certain investment single geothermal plant be expensive and can not be guarantee to tap into the reserve the analysis suggest will be find by pool together the investment opportunity of number of site economy of scale be create the risk of not all the site deliver can be factor in and the number can still be make to add up the private sector be willing and able to invest in such an opportunity have personally meet representative from number of capital fund and deep geothermal developer and they would leap at such project we estimate that dedicated fund of just million for plant at public sector site could unlock million of private sector investment and kick start wide industry in the uk will the minister meet and other member of the appg to discuss that in the near future alongside that there be powerful argument for broad geothermal development incentive model on the heat incentive which will provide business with confidence that geothermal be part of the uk energy future it could be model on contract for difference ensure competitive process but by offer scale we would again be reduce risk for development know there be concern about open end support for any industry but the aforementioned rea arup report model support for only an initial wave of project that would help establish scale industry in the uk which could then stand on its own two foot establish deep geothermal strategy be crucial to set clear target and provide long term road map for the sector will the minister advise whether the government will produce such strategy government support be key to enable route to market for the sector know the government be shortly due to publish review of the comparative cost of deep geothermal when do the minister expect the review to be publish that would provide welcome update know that industry stakeholder that work with the appg and other would be happy to act as critical friend of that review ahead of publication would the minister be happy to facilitate that it be so important to ensure that this review have look at all the evidence and can make full use of the experience of industry the appg also consider and be try to raise awareness of the benefit of shallow geothermal as the hon member for camborne and redruth perran moon mention while it be very closely related to deep geothermal as we might expect that industry face different challenge but it could offer solution even more widely know that significant private sector investment be available again we be talk about technology that could reduce the strain on electricity drive grid connection for both sector gb energy might well be expect to play vital role can the minister confirm my expectation that its remit will extend to heat as much as to electricity and can she confirm whether the mandate from government will ask it to consider deep geothermal specifically on that point could the government not help the industry by also ensure that there be an overarch geothermal regulatory regime which think it be fair to say we do not really have yet in the uk would the hon gentleman support that be bring forward agree with the hon gentleman that be one of the piece of the jigsaw that will far unlock private sector investment in my engagement with industry that be slightly far along the chain of thing that it be look for the number do not add up at all at the minute let alone proper regulatory regime be in place as soon as we unlock the number the demand for all the other area will really ramp up which be why we need this thought through strategy from government so that they can anticipate and prepare to bring in the other element when they become particularly important hope that have do an adequate job of showcase the industry and its potential everything we have learn in recent year show that we need to take advantage of every opportunity we need to build the big coalition deploy the large possible workforce and spread the benefit of decarbonise as widely as possible if we be to succeed and bring the country with we in the challenge can not think of well way of do that than put dedicated resource into deep geothermal know that it could bring benefit to my constituent and to the constituent of many other member and unlock hundred of million if not billion of pound of investment into our economy look forward to hear about the minister plan and ambition which hope will get we there thank the hon member for bexhill and battle dr mullan for bring this important issue to the attention of the house also thank my hon friend for their contribution and for the valuable way in which they have engage in this debate the hon member for bexhill and battle have be great champion of deep geothermal energy in recent year and the role he have play in the formation of the all party parliamentary group on deep geothermal be commendable be very pleased to attend its meeting in december and be grateful for the engaged and constructive discussion that we have agree with the hon member that there be huge opportunity here and echo his desire for action and pace will briefly say why share that desire he will know as do that we be come out of the bad cost of living crisis that we have see in generation and energy have be at the very heart of that crisis the reality be that energy be unaffordable for too many people and increasingly out of reach for people who absolutely rely on it as an essential good and we as government be determined to fix that that mean that we need to take action to lower energy bill by break our reliance on international fossil fuel market and sprinting towards clean home grow power that be why the government be so committed and why we be run at our clean power by mission but it be also why our warm home plan be absolutely critical reassure the hon member that we see that geothermal power have critical role to play in our energy mix follow its success in the fifth auction round of contract for difference agree that geothermal energy represent an important opportunity if the hon member hear nothing else say today ask he to hear that it have the potential to deliver clean and secure energy and heat reduce our reliance on fossil fuel market as he mention we be acutely aware that geothermal energy could also support just transition by create thousand of job that use skill from our oil gas and coalmine sector the government provide financial support for geothermal project today and we will continue to do so the critical thing be ensure that this be do at an acceptable cost to consumer and in an environmentally friendly way as the hon member mention the most widespread potential for deep geothermal in the uk be as low carbon heat source for heat network be convinced that heat network have really important role to play as we roll out clean heat and upgrade million of home across the country we have the opportunity to grow their market share from today to by one of my first visit as the minister for energy consumer be to the mersey heat network where heat from the leeds and liverpool canal be be use to provide hot water and low carbon power for thousand of people thank to water source heat pump that be great example of how community can benefit from local energy source which be what the hon member and my hon friend be advocate for in this debate completely commend that and support it there be significant geothermal success story such as in gateshead where the first mine water heat network to become operational in the uk receive million from our heat network investment project that money enable the council and gateshead energy company to install km of new heat network pipe and mw water source heat pump today that network heat council home and the baltic art centre with more home to be add the hon member for bexhill and battle refer to the public sector scheme geothermal heat project supply public sector site be eligible to apply for support provide that they meet that scheme eligibility criterion and again agree with he that there be big opportunity here would add however that any change to the scheme would need to be consider once the current spending round be complete that be what he would expect to say but reassure he that be very happy to meet he and member of the appg to discuss their proposal the point to emphasise be that the current scheme be base on go project by project which undermine our ability to bundle up the risk which be so vital to deep geothermal that be the key change we be look for the opportunity for number of site to be pull together which be what will be most attractive to investor we want to think about creative way in which we can unlock the potential for investment so be very keen to meet the hon member and member of the appg so we can hear those proposal give he that reassurance not just today but over recent year the hon member have make convincing case for the merit of pursue deep geothermal the government remain committed to explore the renewable energy opportunity afford by our geography and geology however hope the hon member will understand that the priority now and the thing my boss have task with be develop the warm home plan it would be premature for the government to set geothermal strategy with detailed target in advance of that plan for we it be question of sequence for instance if we be to make the most of geothermal potential we need to start by create an environment that enable the growth of heat network and crucially protect consumer along the way to that end the department will bring forward market regulatory framework in january to improve consumer protection we be also consult on heat network zoning which be an essential part of our plan to establish and accelerate heat network we think that will significantly increase private sector investment and remove some of the barrier we be committed to take long term strategic view and we be try to sequence this work so that we develop the warm home plan and build the enable environment however absolutely recognise the need for we to set policy framework in which geothermal energy can thrive the minister know that really admire the work she be do in this space and my intervention be more of query than anything else she have mention the warm home plan be sense emerge of how many of the million property we be target through that plan might be feed by district heating and associate technology be there crystallisation of what that construct might be to get we to the million home that we be target we know that there be big opportunity for district heating particularly in some of our urban centre in the work that we be try to do through the warm home plan we be think about where those opportunity be and make sure that we work with regional and local government to do some of the planning and the identification of those opportunity that mean that we can take strategic approach area by area and place by place be really grateful for all that the minister be do in this area however some of this work be quite time sensitive for instance we have major development in york the first phase of which go into planning in september we very much want to work with government to see what we can deliver in york central would the minister be prepared to work with we to see whether we can get this model work on some of those micro site we be keen to work with member across the house and with local and regional government we have set ourselves challenging set of ambition so we be clear that we need to work with anyone that can unlock and bring forward investment opportunity so as to realise those over the course of the parliament it would be remiss of if do not say that we recognise that for all the opportunity there be still challenge face by industry to secure the necessary investment as result as the hon member say few deep geothermal project in the uk be financially viable without government support unlike what we see on the continent and in other country the hon member mention the role of great british energy we be clear that it will provide further opportunity for investment in clean energy the great british energy bill set out that clean energy mean energy produce from source other than fossil fuel include geothermal so let reassure he that it be within scope great british energy be an independent organisation but we will give it clear direction that it should be look at all the opportunity that could be exploit across the country and at different technology such as geothermal deployment at scale be also unlikely unless there be demonstrable pathway to bring down the cost of geothermal heat to make it comparable to other renewable technology we know that it be why we have be work with stakeholder to improve our knowledge and understanding in this area in we commission cost research project to which the hon member refer we intend to publish that this year be ask my official to work at pace to do that but reassure he that we will be engage with industry prior to publication and he have my assurance that will facilitate that to ensure that it happen my hon friend the member for rushcliffe james naish commend the british geological survey and share his enthusiasm for it we have commission work from it on open access tool that show the technically viable opportunity for geothermal project in the uk and we will continue to work with it the uk be also an active member of the international energy agency technology collaboration programme on geothermal energy that be mouthful which have enable we to gather far learning and to learn from other international example all that be to say that we see the opportunity and we be try to build the evidence base we want to work with industry to think about how we unlock geothermal because we see it as viable route to the expansion of heat network and to deliver the objective of warm home and cheap bill in conclusion we be absolutely committed to the project and to deliver warm home we know that we need range of technology to do that we can not do this sprint on our own so we will always want to work with industry to enable we to get there thank the hon member for bexhill and battle again for secure this debate and thank my hon friend who be here for be such avid champion of geothermal my department be keen to work with they and look forward to meeting in due course question put and agree to house adjourn
