further prosecution and stop those who have be pollute our waterway can make an appeal to the secretary of state and indeed his whole front bench not to make farmer scapegoat in any water reform clearly where farming and farmer be involve in bad practice they should be penalise but social industrialist other employer and indeed those in the public sector might also pollute river water be

australia and new zealand will the secretary of state support liberal democrat call for the deal to be sign only if it support farmer and after vote in this house there have be no announcement yet and can not pre empt they but we have be crystal clear that we have red line we will not allow british farmer to be undercut on environmental or welfare standard in the way that the conservatives do when

across the criminal justice system to slash those backlog and get case through the court more quickly review be ongoing of how we can reduce the backlog and be confident that what emerge from that review will mean that we can get delay down and set about the kind of reform that will deliver the change that the public deserve to see on the topic of backlog across the justice system the ministry of justice successful campaign to recruit more magistrate be stretch the capacity of local training committee to provide sufficient mentor and appraiser to support new appointee what more can the government do to fill the gap in training capacity to well serve the interest of justice my hon friend be right to highlight the vital role that magistrate play in our criminal justice system as we seek to reduce the intolerable court backlog that we inherit from the previous government have absolutely no doubt that magistrate will continue to have crucial role it be essential that any new

aid provision be drive crown court backlog especially in rural area such as my constituency of north cornwall the hon member raise an important issue it be crucial that justice be accessible for

boost for criminal legal aid solicitor start this year we will also be introduce free independent legal adviser for victim of adult rape there be much more to do we be clear about that clearly there be deficiency in access to justice but can assure the hon member that this government understand the scale of the problem and be commit to address it prosecution of rural crime what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of rural crime the government safe street mission be not just about town and city centre it apply equally to our market square and rural village green rural

to be take out of operation and put in jail do the al capone on they put they in jail for economic crime your problem be solve solicitor general the hon member be absolutely right that fraud do not stop at national border so it be vital that enforcement activity do not stop at national border either that be why the sfo take co operation with international partner extremely seriously in fact most recently the director launch new international anti corruption prosecutorial taskforce with swiss and french partner agency to strengthen exist tie between these country and to lead to great joint work on case as well as the sharing of insight and expertise would argue that we need more of those agreement and great international co operation to tackle the issue that he raise call the shadow

war in europe be sure speak for the whole house in put on record once again our profound thank and our celebration of the immortal memory of that extraordinary generation who through their courage their selflessness and their sense of duty make victory in europe possible let we all pray that we can be worthy of their memory if may turn back from the sublime sweep of history to the mundane business of our politic the government have make valiant effort to crowd the airwave on trade this week but the unfortunate truth be that they have have another dire week in office the financial fact of life have not change growth be stagnant as nation we have to raise defence spending rapidly and the government have make themselves prisoner of their fiscal rule before the leader of the house start in on the local election result may remind she that for all the horror of last week the opposition still end up with three time as many council seat as the government let we look at those cost pressure bit more closely just eight month after increase in pay for junior doctor an increase describe at the time by the british medical association as good enough first step the house will recall the bma have now announce it will ballot its member to strike for more pay meanwhile the somewhat unlikely pairing of tony blair and gary smith the general secretary of the gmb trade union have both denounce the government decision to ban offshore licence in the north sea blair describe it as an irrational policy doom to fail the backlash to which threaten to derail the whole agenda he say it be cause by ministers afraid of be cast as climate denier he be not talk about the secretary of state for energy security and net zero of course he be talk about all the ministers and mps on the government benches who know well but be too frit to say so gary smith say that climate be the secretary of state for energy would accelerate the decline of domestic oil and gas production and increase our dependency on gas import directly contrary to the government suppose growth strategy as he point out across society bill payer will question why they be subsidise domestic clean power sprint that be offshore uk job and value only today we have have the news that ørsted be mothball its giant new offshore wind farm as it have make it clear it be hold out for even great subsidy know that the secretary of state have no choice and have in effect say that he have no choice if he want to hit his target we all want just and rapid energy transition but do the leader of the house not think that the word of tony blair and gary smith be simple common sense there be one other issue that think we should highlight the leader of the house have receive universal condemnation for dismiss concern about groom gang as dog whistle politic in response she put out tweet that conspicuously do not contain an apology for what she have say the secretary of state for health say that her remark be indefensible but the truth be that she have talk in the same way about groom gang from the dispatch box when she accuse people of jump on bandwagon on january this year in business question hope we can agree now that this be an extremely serious national issue and that no one whether or not they hold public office should be deflect or deny its seriousness hope that in her response now the leader of the house will put aside party politic avoid criticise other and speak from the heart so ask she have she now watch the channel documentary and if so how do she feel about it do she agree that the dismissal of these entirely valid concern have be one of the factor behind what even today remain huge continue national scandal will she now back the call of many victim for comprehensive national inquiry into groom gang finally would she like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the hundred of vulnerable woman involve and say sorry mr speaker far to your statement talk on the us trade deal development continue at pace with your permission the house will be update later today will come on to ve day shortly but may first address the remark of the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman thank the right hon gentleman for raise what say on an episode of any questions last week so that can be absolutely clear with the house today and especially to the victim and survivor of child sexual abuse and grooming gang that be very sorry for those remark as make clear over the weekend and every member of this government want your truth to be hear wherever that truth lead your truly appalling experience need to be act on for those responsible to be accountable and face the full force of the law and for justice to be serve would never want to leave the impression that these very serious profound and far reach issue which have campaign on for many year should be shy away from and not air far from it no stone will be leave unturned what the victim want first and foremost be for action to be take and for the many many recommendation from previous inquiry to be implement in full include mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse for which have call for nearly decade shockingly those recommendation remain sit on the shelf until we come into government last year baroness louise casey who conduct the no holds bar inquiry into rotherham be carry out an audit on the scale nature and characteristic of groom gang she will be report soon it will include the question on ethnicity every police force in england and wales have be ask to look again at historic grooming gang case they will be reopen where appropriate to get the perpetrator behind bar hope the house be leave in no doubt about my commitment to these issue and my apology to those victim for any distress have cause they be surprised to hear the shadow leader of the house try to claim some success in the local election for his party be not quite sure that that be what those on the conservative benches be feel let address the issue of our need to move to be clean energy superpower be afraid that yet again at the dispatch box the right hon gentleman and his party be show serious misunderstanding of the economic and the reality of the transition to net zero we face the bad cost of live crisis in generation because his party leave this country expose to international fossil fuel market as direct result of their failure to invest in clean energy it be only by invest in clean energy that we will bring down bill in future he might want to remind himself of what his former prime minister theresa may say about this issue the sceptic say that the green transition will cripple business we say they could not be more wrong this be global race for the job of the future to get bill down and that be exactly what we be do the right hon gentleman should know well than anybody that new oil and gas in the north sea will not take penny off bill because oil and gas be trade on the international market and therefore we be lock in the only way to decouple that be by invest in cheap renewable energy as the government be do it be previous conservative energy minister who say in more uk production would reduce the global price of gas the right hon gentleman might want to remind himself of that we have all come together in the chamber today to honour our veteran and all those who play their part in secure peace and victory in europe and end the second world war today we mark the anniversary of victory in europe day and will shortly recreate the procession of members from the chamber to service of thanksgiving on may in address the house on that day winston churchill convey his deep gratitude to this house of commons which have prove itself

house agree that consistent collection and publication of disaggregate datum be key to assess whether government action be work for all woman absolutely thank my hon friend for raise that as she know violence against woman and girl be national emergency and tackle it be one of the key mission of this government agree that this datum need to be bring to light and disaggregate mark the anniversary of ve day by commemorate the sacrifice make not just by those who fight and fall in the second world war but by those who continue to serve our country in our armed force and all who support they

take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not speech question should be direct to the select committee chair and not the relevant government minister and front benchers may take part in questioning be pleased to present the environmental audit committee report on the role of natural capital in the green economy this report be initiate by my predecessor as chair the right honourable philip dunne the former member of parliament for ludlow wish to pay great tribute to he for his excellent contribution as chair mr dunne enjoy what suspect be an unusual distinction of have both ask question and answer they in the witness session that lead to this report have originally initiate the report in january and then see parliament dissolve before the report could be publish he be kind enough to return as witness in december to brief the successor committee on the evidence that his committee have hear and to provide his own insight wish to take this opportunity to place on record my gratitude and know the gratitude of member of the committee past and present to our former clerk martyn atkins who recently leave the service of the committee for period of absence after many year of service to the house martyn have play huge role in the work of this select committee and many other and will be very much miss as will chloe jago who recently stand down as press officer on the committee after five year of excellent service to take up role close to home thank all those who have contribute to this report the many people and organisation who submit write and oral evidence the committee staff particularly alex farnsworth who have work tirelessly to complete the report and the member of the current and predecessor environmental audit committee let turn to the report itself we be delighted to see that recommendation no that the government should produce an impact assessment of the planning and infrastructure bill be satisfied within day of our report be publish at this pace we really could get somewhere however we still need to learn more about how the nature restoration fund will interact with biodiversity net gain be glad to see that the minister be here to expand on that in his response the dasgupta review make clear the value of nature nature and the service that it provide underpin both our economy and our way of life in the office for national statistics find that the uk ecosystem service be equivalent to of gdp or trillion the uk have experience significant biodiversity loss in recent decade with the state of nature report show an average of specie abundance decline across more than specie between and the committee agree with the government that economic and financial decision making should support the delivery of nature positive future and we would like to hear repetition of that commitment and indeed to see it actualise in the forthcoming spending review the committee agree with the assertion of this government and the previous government that in time of spending restraint taxpayer money alone be no long sufficient to deliver the necessary level of environmental restoration so private finance must play its part we be pleased to hear from the minister for nature that work be ongoing to well quantify the current size of the annual investment in natural capital the committee therefore recommend that within month the government provide report to parliament on current and projected level of private investment into nature recovery in england so that we can see both the progress that have be make and the size of the funding gap for the government to deliver on protect of land by they must provide landowner with the confidence to invest in nature restoration the long promise land use framework will help and will give assurance that there be strategic approach to balance the compete need for our land in regard to food production nature restoration renewable energy residential and commercial development and other area it will however require natural capital approach to be embed throughout government the committee hear concern that the change to the agricultural property relief regime have add to uncertainty although the government decision to give nature investment equal treatment under inheritance tax at least answer the charge that the government be prioritise nature recovery ahead of food production voluntary driver of market demand alone will not deliver the demand that the government need compliance mechanism and the expectation of future compliance requirement will drive market demand so the government should look at bring in increase compliance requirement such as by expand biodiversity net gain requirement or mandate corporate disclosure of nature damage activity the committee seek assurance that the propose new nature restoration fund be an addition to rather than replacement for government investment in nature recovery without clear support for biodiversity net gain ministers risk cause uncertainty in nature market which could undermine investment in restore nature it will be good to hear full throate defence of bng from the minister in his response to the report defence that we hear from he and indeed from myself when in opposition although the committee support an approach that allow nature recovery initiative to be pool the government must ensure that we do not end up with nature recovery mile away while there be further eradication of nature within urban setting one of the strength of bng be that the community that suffer the nature blight also benefit from the recovery of nature locally it will be good to get commitment from the minister about that principle remain in place under the nature restoration fund proposal nature can grow hand in hand with our economy and money from growth should go back into help nature thrive the report provide the government with road map to restore nature by capitalise on our huge national strength as global financial leader it caution the government not to undermine the progress already make and offer our support for the measure that help nature recovery come hand in hand with the economic growth that the government rightly demand be delighted to speak in support of the committee report and congratulate my hon friend the chair of the select committee on the way in which he have lead the committee and on how he take up the remnant of this report from the last parliament as the first report for our committee in the new parliament he be right to recognise that natural capital be the foundation of our economy with the spending review next month do he agree that the government should set out precisely how they have take natural capital approach to the evaluation of spending decision do he agree that the new national wealth fund should be empower to invest in the natural capital project as highlight in our report to return compliment my hon friend be the only person who be there at the start of the evidence and at the end and we be very grateful for the continuity he provide he be right that as the committee report lay out we need to see natural capital approach embed right through government the forthcoming spending review be great opportunity to see that and really hope that we do he make an important point about the national wealth fund it provide huge opportunity and we look forward to hear what the minister have to say on that both at this juncture and in his response to the report which we will get from the government in due course commend the hon member for the quality of the committee first report of this parliament the national trust have warn that the planning and infrastructure bill be licence to kill nature and the office for environmental protection have advise the government that it be regression in environmental law do he share my concern that nature restoration fund could create risk to the uk economy by undermine our natural capital and do he agree that without substantial private investment in nature government pledge to protect of land by halt the decline of specie and improve people access to green space could be at risk thank the hon member for his kind word will start at the end of his question he be absolutely right and we agree with the government that we need to be able to attract more private investment if the by aspiration be to be realise it be notable that when the government come to the committee they make it clear that they do not yet know as their predecessor government do not know exactly how much be be raise by the private sector the starting point of assess whether the government be on track to meet their target be know how well they be do right now one of the recommendation in the report be therefore that the government should get on with identify the full scale of the current level of private sector investment we will absolutely look to do that the jury be still out on whether the nature restoration fund will be good or bad thing it offer real potential one for one approach on small scheme be sometimes expensive to provide and offer relatively limited value so there be real value to pooled approach that enable money to go in so that wide scale improvement can be deliver however as say we need to be really sure that that do not mean that urban area get the blight and rural area get all the nature gain we need to see it deliver close to where the initial plan be be deliver welcome the publication of the report which remind we all once again that nature be the true foundation of all wealth in our country and around the globe wide range of environmental organisation and eminent academic include sir partha dasgupta professor emeritus of economic at the university of cambridge whose review for the treasury underpin the committee entire report have publicly write to warn that propose plan in the government planning and infrastructure bill be not tool for ecological recovery but licence to kill nature with no evidence to suggest this would in any way help our economy do my hon friend agree that when leading economist former government adviser and leading conservationist with decade of collective experience have express such deep concern about government legislation ministers must listen and think again thank my hon friend for that and for the excellent contribution he be make to the select committee professor dasgupta be hugely respect and his warning should be take very seriously indeed think that all labour members recognise the need for growth but we demand that it come hand in hand with nature recovery we be one of the most nature deplete nation on earth and as my hon friend rightly say nature be the foundation stone on which all economic growth should be build nation that prioritise economic growth over our environment be one head down dangerous and foolish path we have hear some really positive commitment from the government but we need to see they actualised completely agree with what he say congratulate my hon friend and welcome this excellent report with its focus on the value of natural capital on such an important day as sir david attenborough birthday be sure that member across the house will wish to join in express many happy return to he for his important work in this space in coastal and rural constituency like mine in south east cornwall the natural world and its biodiversity be both cherished and central to local job and to the economy do my hon friend agree that integrate natural capital into policy through tool like the nature restoration fund and the nature market framework offer vital opportunity for the government and land manager to restore and increase the uk natural capital in way that strengthen nature boost local resilience and improve wellbee for community and for future generation thank my hon friend for her congratulation as say it be not my report it be ours thank she for her contribution to the committee she be right about that commitment and think all of we on the committee be drive to make sure that

madam deputy speaker you be well known for your indulgence congratulate my hon friend on secure this debate and thank he for do so it be important be one of those people suspect many of we be who be proud to be english and proud to be british recognise they as different thing that we should celebrate uniquely do he agree that those who seek to use englishness to divide we rather than bring we together do huge disservice to what be english be all about do he also agree that those of we who believe that we can have huge patriotism and pride in our englishness but who also recognise the value of inclusivity and generosity that our nation have show over the year need to do much well job at define exactly what it be as we go forward in difficult political time be grateful to my hon friend for make very important intervention there be so much more that bring we together and it be incumbent on all member of this house to make that case and to focus on bring people together rather than

our people be hardworke and many be god fear decent folk who do not walk by on the other side but who turn up to be count we see that in our national health service in our school on our railway in our veteran centre and in community up and down england we see it during the pandemic and in the struggle alongside the people of ukraine against putin tyranny we see it every single day one of england great feature be our countryside and my home of newcastle under lyme have plenty of it our farmer who produce food of the great quality to the high standard deserve real and meaningful support they feed we work hard and lead the world when it come to tend to and care for our land and urge ministers in this government to keep that in mind where the previous government fail we must listen learn

shakespeare alone continue to put england head and shoulder above the rest when it come to influence on global literature alongside he england can claim eliot the brontë sister george orwell jane austen and many more english music be some of the most popular and influential music of all time still today the beatles see the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey be consider by many to be the great band of all time but that be debate for another day alongside the beatles we have the stones david bowie amy winehouse queen adele elton john kate bush the excellent joan armatrading cilla black oasis the clash pink floyd and of course robbie williams man of and from north staffordshire whose mother live in my constituency of newcastle under lyme england have make some of the most enduring and significant contribution to music of any nation on our planet and that be without mention the many other cultural endeavour master by the english english film remain dominant globally new james bond film be still one of the premier cinematic event and no tariff will get in the way of that christopher nolan an englishman be arguably one of the most exciting and skilled film director work today we give thank for actor like the late dame maggie smith and the late and wonderful glenda jackson formerly of this parish and to those still go strong like dame joanna lumley and dame judi dench who have the pleasure of celebrate my birthday with last story for another day madam deputy speaker as the birthplace of reginald mitchell the designer of the iconic spitfire plane home to university birthplace of prime minister albeit that he move to australia to serve in that high office and the home of the founder of the modern circus philip astley the ancient and loyal borough of newcastle under lyme have leave its mark on english history and culture if that be not enough we also have the popular stoke city clown icon nello baldwin constituent of mine speak of stoke city could not make this speech without mention england as the home of the beautiful game with the local football landscape back home in mind of course also pay tribute to port vale today it be important to call for action to ensure that the truth of england story and potential be preserve we must work to ensure that people across england and indeed all across the united kingdom continue to feel pride in our flag and our community and feel hope for the future and respect for our past any talk about love for flag and country must be match by an investment in the people who make they what they be investment in our national health service our education and employment support service our art and culture and our village town and city do not want my speech to focus solely on the past when there be so many exciting thing to say about england future but it would be remiss of not to touch on some part of our history that fill with particular sense of reverence our democracy be one of the old in the world an english parliament have exist in some form since the century and monumental event such as the signing of the magna carta have solidify england position in history as forebearer of individual right and freedom of political expression those right be fight for and hard win across century by brave woman and man who have the vision to see well country and well world for all of we there be many thing could say about england relationship to the wide world but one of the endure strength of our country that always come back to be the courage tenacity and character of ordinary english people right across history england be home to people from all over the world and we be much well for it of course we can not forget that england too leave its mark on all corner of the globe for some misguidedly in my view talk england up be alien to they to speak of the exciting future ahead of we in the vibrant country that we have become be difficult for some to do all they seem able to contribute to our national conversation be view of england as nation in decline nation once great now not have spend much of my several minute speak outline the incredible success and achievement of england past but for those people there be nothing more to england than its past to they say you do know england we have face our fair share of adversity and today of all day remind we of that but as disraeli say the english nation be never so great as in adversity be never so proud to be english as in those moment it be when time be tough that be blow away by the courage tenacity and generosity of the good people of this country the english have always find way to get on persevere and as churchill put it keep bugger on whether after the destruction of two world war or through the heartbreak of disappointing euros final we will continue to do so will continue to look back at our past with the respect and reverence that it deserve and look forward to our future with hope and optimism because do so be part of what make we english and thing can only get well leave my final word to the last verse of one of my and my late grandfather favourite hymn he move to this country in the late to help ensure that we beat fascism and defend democracy shall resist the temptation to sing the verse to you madam deputy speaker interruption disappointing not for some will not cease from mental fight nor shall my sword sleep in my hand till we have build jerusalem in england green and pleasant land we have much to do in this house and in community right across the country so let we get on with happy st george day to one and all call the father of the house it be great honour to follow the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee who be fast establish reputation as an effective parliamentarian and thoroughly nice chap his speech be appropriate and excellent in every single way and agree with everything he say it be not often that labour mp quote former tory prime ministers that be certainly first and we all much enjoy it of course as we all do the hon gentleman rightly mention the famous people from his constituency well can match that for lincolnshire can talk of sir isaac newton john smith of the pilgrim father the great poet alfred lord tennyson and joan plowright can also mention one other person who come from lincolnshire do not want to break the cosy consensus of this debate but it be lady whom greatly admire believe that she restore greatness to this country when she be prime minister need not even mention her name because she be so famous st george be saint he be not english of course when the far right try to capture the flag of st george they should perhaps try to remember that he be an anatolian greek think it be quite good that our national saint be not actually english and that we know virtually nothing about he what we do know be base purely on legend and be almost certainly wrong think that say much about the easy go nature of the english people we be surround by saint here in the undercroft we have st etheldreda st edward the confessor st margaret of scotland st edmund and many more in central lobby we have the four great patron saint of our country there be well wear joke about st andrew be on the way to the bar st patrick on the way to the exit st david on the way to this chamber where we all like to talk and st george on the way to the lords saint unite politician divide have many time express in this chamber it be rather an unfashionable point of view but will mention it briefly the importance of religion in bind people together religion on an ecumenical basis be proud of one religion and its social ethos should be unify factor all the great religion have much the same moral creed and think the decline of religion in england have be rather sad the theme want to talk about so that do not indulge entirely in clichés be the essence of nation be sense of community community in which everybody be in project together all do their bit sadly there have be decline in that sense of community in our nation for instance my parent although english be bring up in france they come here as refugee in when the germans invade france because they have british passport and they meet in bletchley park they have very mixed upbringing but they have complete dedication to this country when my mother be very old she would still insist despite be very infirm on totter off to the polling booth the wartime generation who we be celebrate today have an absolute sense of duty and community and we want to recreate that let make one or two point that may be more controversial there be some factor that be break our sense of community and frankly we all see from the result last week that they be fuel feeling of disillusion one of course be illegal migration we have get to understand that this infuriate everybody it do not just infuriate right wing people who do not like the idea of migrant it also infuriate many people who be work hard and feel that some be take advantage do not want to make any criticism of migrant and do not want to attack they personally take somali migrant why be he try to come here because for hundred of year his family could fish off the coast of somalia and then we in the west send in huge trawler to take all the fish away and take away his livelihood so he resort to piracy quite rightly we then send in warship to deal with that so once again they be starve and he be now on the way here do not think we should approach the issue of migration in nationalistic way what like about the speech make by the hon member for newcastle under lyme be that it be patriotic not nationalistic and it try to heal division the fact be that illegal migration be an open wound in our society it be not just the cost of it with million day spend on hotel there be also sense for many in our country that people who could apply for asylum in the proper normal way be bypass that route we have see from study in the daily telegraph this week how easy it be to pay people smuggler come over here be put in hotel and act as courier that be really infuriate people our fate in the conservative party because we be no long in power be that we be dependent on the labour government solve this problem and they will have to solve it because we can not go on as we be it be fuel great sense of anger in the nation the government have to get derogation from the strasbourg court as have argue many time in order to arrest detain and deport people and then this horrible trade will stop immediately of course there be humanitarian point to be make here these people smuggler be put life at risk and people be die they be feed on human misery we can not do much about it in the conservative party labour be now in power my advice to the government be that if they want to resist this sense of disillusion in society with people turn away from both the labour party and the conservative party they have to do something about it they have to do something about legal migration too there be great sense among people who be work hard here that people be pour in or have pour in blame my government as much as any other do not make party political point here the labour party have take over difficult issue we all know the reason to do with the pandemic and all the other excuse and about how we have to keep the nhs and our care home go but the fact that the conservative government allow million people in legally last year be infuriate people and it be depress wage it might be good for overall gdp but it be certainly bad for individual wealth again we can do very little about it in the conservative party but the government need to act know they be try to take step this be relevant to the debate about st george because it be about try to recreate sense that we be one nation and that everybody work hard everybody pay their taxis and we get benefit such as free education and free health so that when we fall ill we be help by the state be talk to constituent only today and she be clearly lady in some distress she can not move but have just have her personal independence payment cancel she have be tell she have to work from home but she can not work from home because she do not have those sort of skill ever more people be feel angry that they have do their bit and work hard but when they fall ill or need benefit they be not be help we have to all work together to try to again get that sense of the wartime spirit that be bit of cliché but it be about time when everybody muck in everybody have job everybody do their bit and there be frankly very few freeloader represent an agricultural constituency one might wonder why be now get on to that subject but again there be sense among people in agricultural constituency that the government do not understand their point of view we be all in favour of green energy in lincolnshire we be lead on green energy with wind farm in the north sea there be no opposition to they but we be angry that entrepreneur be import solar panel from china make by slave labour and cover acre in my constituency with no proper local planning we be not against solar farm and we be not against the secretary of state for energy security and net zero we just want sense of fairness that local community have say in this and there be some sense of proportion think have say my bit congratulate the hon member for newcastle under lyme and hope we have very good and worthwhile debate congratulate my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee on secure this important debate it be poignant that this debate be happen today on the anniversary of victory in europe day day to commemorate the sacrifice bravery and resilience of so many as well as the courage to stand up for what be right that to be the embodiment of st george spirit sometimes the magnitude of the privilege of be in this place really hit home and today be one of those day look around be think more than usually do of the sacrifice make by so many veteran and current service personnel from weston super mare worle and the village across the country and across the commonwealth have think more deeply than probably ever before about the sacrifice of my own dear grandparent during the second world war and the sacrifice of my very love family member currently serve our country in the royal air force it be such privilege to stand here in this place and pay tribute to they in the spirit of st george and all the good that he can represent in the past st george day be mark by grand festivity across the land with feast parade and community gathering that bring people together in celebration of what it mean to be english if ever we need to revive that spirit now be the time we should take full advantage and celebrate our share heritage and rebuild pride in our country and hope for the future because patriotism be much more than rose tint nostalgia and it be not the preserve of one political party or ideology too often patriotism be wield as weapon its true meaning lose in the noise of performative gesture and narrow nationalism but the patriotism value be show up for the people place and principle that define our country this st george day launch campaign in weston super mare to make st george day bank holiday invite my constituent to add their support to the campaign and be strike by the variety of response we receive many embrace it with enthusiasm while other meet it with scepticism and cynicism it get think again about why patriotism should feel suspect or shameful for some we need to own it because this love of our country be not exclusive to any one faction or class it be deep pride in who we be our share value and the common ground upon which we all stand true patriotism be not about cling to an idealise past either it be about strive for fairer kind more just future it be about compassion decency the rule of law and good dose of common sense and it be not blind loyalty either it be principle commitment to make this country well for everyone for patriotism be about the everyday thing in life that make england the good place in the world to live it be walk along sand bay beach in my constituency as the sea breeze whip through the air and the rain bat we in the face make sure that we feel alive it be listen to my favourite frank turner album england keep my bone burst with pride about the country that be from it be fish and chip on the grand pier it be wallace and gromit and victoria wood on tv and it be pot of tea to warm up after take the dog for walk around ashcombe park it be also stand up to injustice and care enough to say we can do well than this love your country do not mean settle for the way thing be but strive for how thing could be it be about people find their voice among those loud and vexatious people who seek to dominate with hate and division those who show up do the hard graft and organise and campaign for well future be the patriot so too be the teacher who stay late to help struggle student the single parent juggle work and family and the many volunteer who give up their free time to serve their community drive not by need for recognition but by deep love for their neighbour and their country those be the everyday patriot who be too often leave out of the national story meanwhile there be those who wrap themselves in the flag while eagerly chip away at the value it represent equality freedom and justice my grandfather proud dunkirk veteran who do not like to talk about any of his time during the war know who those mendacious charlatan who would wear the flag but not represent any of its value be and he instill in each and every one of his grandchild how to spot they he give we few tip about how to take they down as well it be time that we reclaim patriotism as unify force for good we should not shy away from it we should own it because what be more patriotic than strive to make this country fair kind and more inclusive from the suffragette to strike miner from steelworker to civil right campaigner our country have always be full of people who love this country enough to demand well if we abandon patriotism to those who use it as blunt instrument of exclusion we allow its true spirit to be distort we must champion different kind of patriotism that be not performative or exclusionary but principled and inclusive one that honour and support our armed force but also the carer the bus driver and the immigrant work tirelessly in our health and care service to look after our sick and elderly loving england do not mean pretend everything be fine but care enough to fix what be not it mean believe in the uniqueness of our community the warmth of our people and the promise of our future and it mean make sure that every single one of we regardless of background be part of that story let we renew that commitment not just to symbol and ceremony but to real meaningful patriotism the kind that bring people together strive for fairness and justice and dare to imagine well country for all rise to take part in this very important debate on st george day and english affair commend the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for secure the debate will say bit more about the hon member later on because believe that he be fine addition to this house and that he demonstrate patriotism in all that he do before do so and before speak more generally about st george day may say that today we also meet in solemn remembrance and in proud celebration of may year ago when the gun fell silent across europe victory in europe day mark not just the end of long and brutal war on our continent but the triumph of courage unity and unyielde resolve over tyranny in romford essex and across england the church bell ring out neighbour embrace and family pause to remember those who have lose love one but also to welcome those who have return we remember the generation who face that unimaginable darkness with unwavering bravery the soldier who fight on land at sea and in the air the family who endure the blitz the worker and nurse who keep our nation go and those who make the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom let we never forget that peace be not simply inherit but earn and it must be defend anew by each generation as we reflect on victory in europe day we honour our past by commit to future shape by democracy justice and international co operation pay tribute to my father frederick william rosindell who be an officer in the royal air force during the second world war and fly transport plane he also serve in the royal canadian air force with which he train in canada during the second world war we owe so much to all my constituent

if you could convey our thank to mr speaker for host that wonderful event would be grateful hope that hon member will join we next year although the great feast day of st george the patron saint of england and englishness be now celebrate with zeal in this place and in many town and village across our country it be notable that in wide cultural and civic life the celebration of englishness can sometimes be frown on and english culture can even be demean by some that be part of the reason for the existence of the royal society of saint george under royal patronage it have the noble object of promote englishness and the english way of life which be proud to support as both member of parliament and chairman of the society branch in the houses of parliament it be however important to note that the need for great recognition and appreciation of england and her people run beyond the level of culture deep into the root of our constitutional and devolutionary arrangement under the devolutionary arrangement enact at the turn of the century with piece of legislation such as the scotland act that create the scottish parliament regional parliament be also create for the first time in century the unifying linchpin of these island the crown in parliament seem to have be wrench out of place it be demonstrably true that this have weaken the national unity of our nation and cause some regional nationalistic and factionalised tendency which believe run counter to britain cultural institutional and constitutional heritage however it be the reality we must operate in today even if we do not relish it perhaps the most intellectually consistent response would be to advocate for the reversal of devolution but of course there be unlikely to be such political appetite today to do so what must be acknowledge be that england the most populous region with the big economy be the only home nation not to have her own devolve parliament this have create democratic deficit in which the proud people of england such as those in my constituency of romford essex be leave with the rich cultural heritage outline early but rather diminished democratic voice please spare we another parliament my right hon friend will know that be very strong supporter of this parliament and this united kingdom be not of course member of this house when devolution be introduce but have be here at the time most certainly would not have vote to break up our united kingdom in the way that we have do by create different parliaments and assemblies across the uk include the london assembly which would love to see abolish very soon appreciate that the hon member be speak about st george day and english affair but would just take issue with his use of the phrase break up to describe the effect of devolution on our country we devolve some of the power close to the people so that they feel more represented that be not an attempt to break up the country say as member of the party which along with the labour party be instrumental in achieve devolution that it be to hold the country together while allow people to feel close to where decision be make have the utmost respect for the hon lady and she make an extremely valid and important point nobody want to break up the united kingdom and do not intend to cause offence by say that believe that all member of parliament should be equal elect representative should be equal but if we create different type of elect representation at different level it mean that english mp have different role from scottish mps because they have msps in scotland who have another role by do so we be muddle up our constitution and regret that that happen but we have to move on that be now quarter of century ago and we need to think about the future there have be certain attempt to deconstruct that democratic deficit we have english vote for english law also know as evel that procedure be bring into the house unitary authority and mayoralty have be create across england and we be see more be create as we speak the procedure for create mayoralty be too remote and the procedure to make they meaningful and to appeal to people who feel ignore be look at with contempt these mayoralty be not support by most people think they believe in local democracy at truly local level and that be not solve by create vast regional mayoralty and assembly that be not in tune with local people in local community there may be merit in the new devolutionary arrangement be consider at local government level but those will only be effective if they address the cultural economic and political reality of the locality with which they be concerned for example yesterday lead an adjournment debate about the london borough of havering and essex devolution apparently havering be not allow to be consider as part of devolution in essex in that debate highlight how successive regional london authority and the plan for essex devolution have ignore the local essex identity of my constituent particularly in romford that have happen under successive government the historic county in the patchwork of traditional england will play an important part in devolution hope the minister will take back the point that perhaps the historic county and the ceremonial county could be align to avoid the muddle and confusion many member and have to debate with people over whether place such as romford be really essex or london what be we it muddle lot of people mind and create lot of confusion and it need to be resolve align the historic and the ceremonial county would go long way to solve that it would mean that local government could be purely for administration and the provision of local service and it would mean that people local identity be not mix up therefore request that the government open up discussion and plan for restore all the facet of the english way of life so that my constituent no long feel that they be be ignore it be an obvious but integral point that any attempt to deconstruct and replace the current devolutionary arrangement can only be successful if hard work people like my constituent in romford essex be listen to and hear be sure that all member of the house would agree that their constituent voice must be hear english democracy might then be restore to the place of pride it use to occupy just as the english cultural repertoire that have pride of place in speaker house early this year make such an impact on so many of we as we reflect on our proud english history our magnificent british tradition the

that be good about england all that we have achieve and all that we must do together it be no surprise but it be also unfortunate that there be only three party represent in the house for the duration of the debate the labour party the tories and the liberals let that be lesson to many in our community up and down england england be great country where so much good have be do but there be so much more to do so let we get on with it question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider st george day and english affair brain tumour research and treatment beg to move that this house note that brain tumour awareness month take place in march further note that there have be no progress in nhs treatment of brain tumour in year and that they be the big cancer killer of people under the age of call on the government to demand that the national institute for health and care research take action to spend the million provide by the government for brain tumour research in for innovative and meaningful drug trial follow the death of the late baroness tessa jowell and far call on the government to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to undertake research into the repurposing of drug for brain tumour and to require the nhs repurposing service to consider the repurposing of drug for brain tumour on saturday november margaret collapse in front of without warn she lie on the floor convulse in epileptic fit by am two young doctor at university college hospital tell that she have brain tumour on the wednesday as approach her bed on the ward she say look at that doctor he can look at the news from that scan must be really bad bring he over of course as you will know madam deputy speaker she be always right my brilliant sister margaret the fierce strong brave kind woman have ever know have glioblastoma brain tumour when it come to such brain tumour there be an average life expectancy of nine month from diagnosis and five year survival rate of just there have be no improvement in nhs treatment in year and the uk be grade out of comparable country for its performance glioblastoma be the only opponent that my sister have never beat but over month she give it she very well shot stand here just six week before the second anniversary of her loss remain as determined as ever to fight for cure for this savage cancer in the face of what can only be describe as indifference from the nhs the pharmaceutical industry the national institute for health and care research the medical and healthcare product regulatory agency and regret to say most of the cancer charity in fight this believe that we can find path to improved treatment for not just glioblastoma but all rare cancer however that will happen only if we member of this house cancer campaigner patient and the bereaved make it happen because the system currently conform to einstein definition of madness it continue to do the same thing but expect different outcome do get wrong the system would like to cure glioblastoma but it be just prove bit difficult what be laughingly describe as the gold standard of nhs treatment have not change in year it include surgery which do not actually remove the tumour brutal eight week of radiotherapy and then as much temozolomide chemotherapy as someone can take which in margaret case be not very much then nothing from the nhs those with saving home pension or the ability to fundraise use everything they have to travel to other country where people believe that those diagnose with terminal disease should have access to all available treatment in margaret case that person be dr sahinbas in düsseldorf as for those for whom that be not an option and there be many our holy revere nhs expect they just to lay down take their fate and die just as would not let margaret lay down and die we should not let anyone in the uk simply lie down and die from glioblastoma here be how we can change thing first we need early diagnosis in the vast majority of glioblastoma case the neuro oncology multidisciplinary team can diagnose the tumour from an mri scan in most case they wait for surgery which could take full eight week from the mri give that develop groundbreake immunotherapy treatment be base on give the drug ahead of surgery early mri diagnosis would allow improvement in treatment and outcome secondly we need drug trial the only way to find cure for glioblastoma and other rare cancer be through drug trial but as those with such cancer know there be none nhs trial have collapse and the pharmaceutical industry concentrate on the large lucrative condition breast prostate bowel and lung cancer if we believe that no cancer should be leave behind in country with some of the most innovative pharmaceutical company and healthcare system as universal as ours the government should broker partnership between that industry and the nhs to make sure that new or repurposed drug be trialle for all cancer they should share the early risk the nhs should run the trial and the drug company should be expect to provide the drug will the minister and the department of health and social care directly support test case project for glioblastoma treatment in which strategy be develop with astrazeneca which have set up rare cancer unit thirdly we must keep cost down cost be always barrier to more drug trial however trial carry out through the national institute for health and care research be conduct at reduce cost to keep cost down trial into glioblastoma and other rare cancer should automatically be nihr badge and all fund trial should be give access to nhs resource fourthly the mission of the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency should be review the mhra be the gatekeeper of drug license in the uk and it understandably require that all datum on all trial be publish but in my personal experience from speak with pharmaceutical company that be barrier to they provide their good and most innovative drug while accept that all information should be publish information on drug trial should be publish for their respective cancer if drug that be originally for lung cancer be trialle on glioblastoma that should be record separately fifthly we need to change the purpose of the nhs medicine repurpose project to provide exist drug for trial many of our lead medical oncologist believe that there be already drug in use that could improve and maybe even cure glioblastoma but it have never be trialle that be why be call for the repurposing of the nhs medicine repurpose programme we should add the aim of supply exist drug for the treatment of glioblastoma and other rare cancer have submit these five propose pledge to the government consultation on the national cancer plan they be bear out of my personal experience of talk to anybody who move about glioblastoma over the last two year be only one mp with gcse in biology but hope with all my heart that my submission will be take seriously and that the government will grab it with both hand to ensure that nobody else go through what my sister go through thank the hon member for that move speech would like to place on the record my love and admiration for her sister margaret pay tribute to the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh this be debate that wish we be not at wish there be no need for we to have this debate but sadly there be this be an issue that have come to know more about personally in the last few month after young constituent come to archie be year old elite athlete from edinburgh training for the commonwealth game and the olympic trial he be diagnose with an inoperable and terminal idh mutant low grade glioma rare form of brain tumour that disproportionately affect young people as say he be year old however there should be good news because there be new highly promising drug so promising be tell that the trial be stop midway through and those on the placebo be give the drug because it be prove so successful in inhibit the growth of the tumour it be develop in edinburgh and be available to eligible patient through name patient programme through which it be be administer free of charge but not everywhere only in scotland in the nhs greater glasgow and clyde and nhs tayside area however archie have not be give access to the drug because of the routine blood testing and the cost to nhs lothian and his msp have write to nhs scotland and the lothian health board and have write to the drug company to ask how we can make the drug available it seem the cruell of thing that drug be available have be partly develop in archie own city but he can not have it know that the nhs be devolve but drug policy be not it seem unfair that we live with situation in which lifesave treatment be decide by postcode people be pass from pillar to post only to be tell that they can not or will not have treatment that be available and that the only option be radiotherapy chemotherapy and the other intervention that the hon member for mitcham and morden describe which could be replace one word cover lot of the excuse that we have be give affordability as if we be deal with anything other than human being whose situation be no fault of their own understand the pressure on finance on resource and on the nhs we all do but that can not mean limit to our ambition in what we can do for those who be suffer we be all here because we believe that we can make difference certainly do not come here with the intention of sit back and accept that could not help when it come to health or that we would talk about save money when we should talk about save life count myself lucky to have meet so many dedicated and strong people since be invite into archie home to talk with he and his family about the challenge they face and how we could help they one of those people be dawn from the astro brain tumour fund whose son shay be diagnose with grade idh mutant astrocytoma he say chemotherapy and radiotherapy that what the future hold for after battle through an awake brain surgery month of rehabilitation wake up every day battle this disease in my own head put smile on my face for those around just to have to go through another year of turmoil and appointment only to be leave with potential long term cognitive issue and even far away from the year old know on april that be not cure it be no long good enough to say that treatment be too difficult or expensive family be crowdfunde for treatment and look abroad this be not the nhs that bevan envisage it be not the nhs that any of we want we be let people down if we do not do as the hon member for mitcham and morden suggest by test such drug on everyone and make they available everywhere when such drug come up and can save people life surely we should ensure that it be available throughout the country without geographical limit pay tribute to my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh for the way she have pursue this issue seriously and with such emotion know her sister margaret she be labour party organiser and know she for year she terrify to be honest over the year but always admire her commitment to the labour party and the wide community think margaret would be proud of her sister for the speech she make today and the work that she have do congratulate the milan group woman group in my constituency they call themselves lady group it be group of asian lady who come together when one lose their daughter to brain tumour they come together every year include last weekend when they raise for the brain tumour charity each year they get to do something this year sing in punjabi and they have to lock the door the previous year dance to bhangra music try to purchase the video off they because it be go viral at one point that raise large amount of money and show the commitment in the wide community as people become more aware of the situation and of the impact of brain tumour particularly among child people realise that something must be do want to make particular point to reinforce what my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden have say there be desperate need to look at the mechanism by which new drug be bring forward and trialled and people can access those trial be member of the all party parliamentary group on brain tumour and we meet one family who be desperate to get on to trial of particular drug but the drug be be delay through the mechanism we have at the moment completely understand the process we have to go through to ensure that drug be safe and do not cause harm but there be frustration at how long that take and the fact that some people who have no other option be not be allow to access those trial quickly or effectively enough on that one occasion we meet the drug company and as an all party group think we do have beneficial effect in bring forward the trial and enable some of the sufferer to access those trial which we hope will be successful one of the most important point my hon friend make be that the system just be not work at the moment it be produce an element of frustration and lack of confidence in the nhs which be disappointing that be because the treatment be not be bring forward quickly enough the access to the trial be tortuous to say the least and there do not seem to be any mechanism by which we be co ordinating well with the pharmaceutical industry and try to set priority for it my hon friend mention why the industry concentrate on other cancer because that be where the big profit be but there have to be some way in which we can incentivise these company to focus on this range of condition the problem be that there be so many type of brain tumour and it be difficult to see company invest large amount of money when there might be only limited impact on small group of patient however that be where government come in the resourcing of the experimentation research and trial be so important and that fall to the state my hon friend have make the point in previous debate and in meeting of our all party group that even where the money be there to enable that to happen it be not get out there we have go through the different organisational structure to investigate what the issue be think it be lack of leadership and that need to come from government one of the suggestion put to the minister be that there need to be conference it might be one off where we bring everybody together again the government have put forward their proposal in the cancer strategy and they have look at the pathway but new element of zest be need we need to bring the pharmaceutical company in and have an honest discussion about whether the exist structure be work well enough and whether there need to be some rationalisation to ensure that we be more effective and speedy in our action and to investigate what the pharmaceutical company need in order for research to be undertake speedily more effectively and with great patient access as the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine say there be an issue with the funding of individual drug if there be to be rationing process it be well to be open and transparent about how rational the implementation be across england scotland and wales at the moment there seem to be bit of postcode lottery in people ability to access these individual drug in particular when they be be develop for trial we need fresh initiative be sure the government will commit to do all they can in the come period and hope that more resource will be apply but unless we get the structure right the application of those resource will be as frustrating as it be at the moment as think the minister can understand there have be an expression of frustration at each of our all party group meeting because the structure be not implement what the government themselves want the wise investment of resource and more effective link up with private sector pharmaceutical company we need some form of breakthrough event to enable we to move forward more effectively and more rapidly finally pay tribute to the various charity include the brain tumour charity that be do such hard work to raise fund and to give hope and comfort to people as their family go through this appalling experience thank they for all the support they have give we in the all party group thank the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh for share her story and for all her endeavour in this house on behalf of her sister and other hope she will forgive for say that she have big heart and she express that in this chamber often the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell say he be afraid can not believe he would be afraid of anybody but be sure she be not too formidable no matter what the case may be for any family to receive the news of brain tumour be instantly worry and we think of all who have lose their life to this dreadful illness just recently we mourn with dear friend of mine whose daughter go to hospital with suspect stroke and within two month have go to eternity with glioblastoma brain tumour she give an image of red squirrel in the nearby mount stewart estate run by the national trust and that will always have pride of place in my office in northern ireland brain tumour case be diagnose between and some case per year at the end of there be almost people live with brain tumour with the diagnosis occur between and during that period of brain tumour case be among woman as in the case that know of and in that raise by the hon member for mitcham and morden if be to ask for one thing out of this debate today it would be for extra money to be make available for research and to find the cure because that be really what we want brain tumour be the big cancer killer of child and adult under in the uk people be diagnose with brain tumour each year and incidence rate of brain tumour be significantly high in northern ireland and wales than in other uk country brain tumour case be project to rise in northern ireland by some by which be really worrying the minister always endeavour to give we the answer we all seek and ask she to work alongside the department of health in northern ireland to see how all of we in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland can work together to take on glioblastoma cancer and tumour despite treatment such as surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy some patient find themselves resistant to therapy and they relapse and unfortunately may face death after some month queen university belfast be make giant stride in research and repurpose exist drug to ascertain if they can make difference to these dreadful statistic while it be thankful for the funding give by brainwaves ni and other charity the government need to assist those charity and other group by make funding available to the highly qualified scientist who could find cure and have path to take but have be preclude from do so due to the lack of money the statistic be startling more child and adult under die of brain tumour than of any other cancer yet only of national research spending go on brain tumour research more research and more spend could make great difference this must be rectify the difficulty be that no symptom be unique to brain tumour headache nausea vomiting blurred vision or weakness of the limb can be due to other pressure effect within the brain tumour can also cause seizure due to infiltrative effect on the brain substance there be many symptom include deafness visual disturbance and problem with the sense of smell want to give wee example my parliamentary aide have be suffer from day headache she be the one who write all these speech for every week very busy lady she book an eye test after she do some research and ask for far intensive scan which she pay for herself thankfully in way it turn out that her eye have deteriorate but that the headache be not due to anything that she have fear there be good point to make here how many young people would not think to do this or would say can afford to do that how much awareness be there that headache be not always down to dehydration how many people understand that an eye test be an essential part of our healthcare perhaps the minister would consider make eye test free at source for those who work as well as those on benefit to increase the number of people have an eye test who need one but just do not think about it in conclusion ever conscious of time understand that money be not unlimited and that the government must make effective use of funding but when stand at the funeral service and watch the heartbreak of my friend think that there be nothing more important than stop that heartbreak in northern ireland and across this great united kingdom research be the key and we must find the promising research as matter of urgency hope that the debate today will be step in the right direction congratulate my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh on secure this important debate she be tireless campaigner on this issue which be clearly very close to her heart thank the hon member for witney charlie maynard for co sponsor the debate their joint sponsorship demonstrate the cross party nature of support for tackle this issue no matter which party we belong to we can all get behind that my constituent alex from horwich get in touch with about his story with his permission would like to share some of that with hon member today alex powerful testimony remind we just how important it be that we support effort to improve treatment for those suffer from glioblastoma and brain tumour more broadly in june alex suffer seizure at home and be initially diagnose with epilepsy but he be later diagnose with glioblastoma despite go through surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy process that must have be incredibly difficult to bear for his wife emma and child joseph and eloise the cancer return alex have recently have his secondary surgery at salford royal and tell that though the team and lead doctor he have deal with have be outstanding the treatment available have hardly change for year as colleague have already note will read some of alex own word as they speak much more eloquently than can to the struggle that he have face he say the real challenge be know what to say to our loved one especially our kid we choose to drip feed relevant information allow life to carry on even during gcse whether that right or wrong do know but we keep go and that what matter one in three people in the uk know someone affect by brain tumour it kill more child and adult under the age of than any other cancer as the hon member for strangford jim shannon mention but receive just of the national spend on cancer research since his diagnosis alex have fundraise vigorously for brain tumour research and recently arrange for bolton town hall to be light up in honour of brain tumour awareness month on alex behalf praise the amazing work do by brain tumour charity such as brain tumour research for all they do in raise awareness and funding research and the staff at the christie and salford hospital for their outstanding care despite the constraint around treatment those charity clearly can not do it all on their own and the government must support where they can as well as increase well use funding would like to see more clinical trial and fast diagnosis and treatment by the nhs that be vital give the speed with which the illness can take hold and the challenge associate with diagnosis finally echo call by colleague and the brain tumour charity for national brain tumour strategy and urge the minister to give that serious consideration such strategy be vital give the current shortfall in the research landscape that have hold back progress to date too thank and commend the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh for secure the debate it have be pleasure to work with she and we be all in awe of her single minded relentlessness on this topic from which we can all learn have similar story two year ago receive call from my nephew and my two niece ask to come over quickly jump in the car and drive as fast as could to my sister house where find her semi conscious on the floor which be the start of journey over the past two year she be diagnose with glioblastoma she undergo surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy she be somewhere up there in the gallery now and she be do incredibly well she be an absolute inspiration to everyone who meet she in her raw courage determination empathy and joy in the world we do not know how it go from here but she bring home in her thinking how wonderful and beautiful our world be she have also be drive force we have raise and count so far for the brain tumour charity which do wonderful job and she have bring people in left right and centre who have suffer or be suffer from gbm or have lose love one to gbm she be engage thoughtful and determined and my heart go out to she will mention the stat we know that there be type of brain tumour some people be diagnose with brain tumour every year and the nasty people die from brain tumour each year in the uk in may the government announce research fund of million on the back of the death of baroness tessa jowell to encourage new research into brain tumour administer through the national institute for health and care research on that day the then health secretary the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt say at this agonising time hope her family can draw comfort from the fact that her legacy will be life save and heartbreak avert for thousand of other family however three year later in may the then health secretary report that just million of that million have be allocate for dedicated brain tumour research three year after that in march under new government spend to date directly on brain tumour research be just million concerningly little bit of text be add after that which say plus an estimate million in infrastructure have three key question for the minister which would love some answer to because more than people die each year be far too many this have be go on for far too long we need to do more and fulfil the promise that this house have make the three question be as follow will the minister confirm that the new wording be not an attempt to include the million of infrastructure spend in the million headline number with view to get the nihr and the government off the hook on their commitment to spend the full million that they have commit to new research into brain cancer will the government commit to allocate and spend the million within decade which be already far too long of their original may commitment by may which be three year from now that be doable if we put our mind to it and we need the government help will the government stand by the may commitment to host an annual global conference to bring together world expert on brain cancer that have not be do and we commit to that as house will we stand by that commit to it and kick off conference by the end of the year salute the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh for secure this debate hopefully we can turn her personal tragedy into national triumph if we work together she be absolutely correct in say that individually certain type of brain tumour be very rare but collectively they be very common the simple fact that only of our national cancer research funding go to they be absolutely unacceptable refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests as be national health service optometrist will speak on that topic because simple eye test can detect brain tumour as the hon member for strangford jim shannon say have unfortunately or fortunately in certain case because we have be able to detect they early be in the position of see people who be completely asymptomatic or people come in with simple headache have brain tumour detect that be why really want to emphasise that the avenue of use eye test be undervalue and underutilise they be completely un invasive cost efficient and accessible and they can save so many life be it at all possible for we to have national awareness campaign as part of broad body to ensure that eye test can be link to brain tumour so that they can be detect pay tribute to mr and mrs atwal in my constituency who lose their daughter and have be do fundraising one of the most effective thing they have be do be ensure that at local community event there be stall that provide information about how to access diagnosis that have prove to be incredibly effective as range of other professional have pick up on the information pay tribute to mr and mrs atwal for their creativity this be about awareness campaign people should be aware that think of child unfortunately diagnose with brain tumour experience some kind of sight loss or vision change and one in three people diagnose report problem with their vision that convert into brain tumour an eye test can not detect all brain tumour but it be really valuable tool over people have sign petition demand that brain tumour research be no long leave behind these be not just signature as we have hear from today powerful testimony they be family and they be story of life cut short and miss chance we can not allow that to continue any long thank the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and my hon friend the member for witney charlie maynard for bring forward this debate it have be privilege to sit through such excellent speech on this very important topic be sure that the hon lady sister margaret would be very proud of she and be sure that my hon friend sister be proud of he too as the hon lady and my hon friend have outline brain tumour diagnosis can be utterly devastating and life change some people year be diagnose with primary tumour while many other be diagnose with secondary tumour that have spread from elsewhere in their body primary tumour be largely unpreventable and cause the death of more adult and child under than any other type of cancer as primary brain tumour do not spread around the body like other cancer type they do not receive the same staging categorisation current nhs programme for diagnose cancer early do not include brain tumour as they focus on target and improvement for catch more cancer in stage and nearly half of people find to have so call benign tumour grade or tumour that grow more slowly those tumour be not technically cancerous so they be not cover by previous cancer plan or initiative for improve cancer care however the treatment and care for patient with low grade tumour have long last impact and can be life altering would like to mention the experience of my constituent madi ruby who have tirelessly campaign and fundraise on this issue she have experience both grade and grade tumour she first experience symptom of brain tumour in with numbness in her right arm and go on to write backwards and develop headache she go for ct scan when that numbness spread to her foot and she be involve in minor car accident only then be she diagnose with grade meningioma measure cm which be remove she be only at the time although that surgery be successful madi develop partial epilepsy she be eventually discharge after five year of clear scan but as we have hear tumour still impact life she have have poor mental health and become depressed and in her brain tumour return that tumour have also be remove but she still deal with partial epilepsy constant headache and migraine and suffer daily she be also an inspirational person she have bravely speak out about her depression train to be counsellor and be now an associate dean responsible for nursing and ally health professional at wrexham glyndŵr university also want to mention my constituent shaun burgess who raise more than for the brain tumour charity and the meningioma support group by run mile across shropshire last year he be raise money after his wife mo be treat for non cancerous tumour but not everyone diagnose with brain tumour get that second chance shaun have lose friend to more aggressive brain tumour we must end the tragedy of people lose their life because treatment for brain cancer take too long to start as my hon friend the member for witney have outline progress on the treatment of brain tumour have not be good enough the diagnosis and treatment of cancer should be top priority for any government and the uk should be global leader in cancer research and outcome urge the minister to listen to the plea of member from across the house on that point today for so many people diagnosis and treatment be too difficult to access my constituency be typical example the major hospital in shrewsbury and telford face number of challenge and regularly have some of the long waiting time in the nhs for cancer screening and treatment in december just of patient be treat within the day period despite the target be the average across england be much well but still poor at not only do too many people live in treatment desert but when they be finally offer the treatment they need it be hard to access anyone live in rural north shropshire would say that have wait anxiously for week or month for scan and the result they then if the news be bad have to travel extremely long distance for the treatment they need most of north shropshire be an hour and quarter away from radiotherapy centre on public transport for patient with brain tumour public transport be fundamental if they can no long drive one of my constituent have face exactly that problem have have their drive licence suspend by the driver and vehicle licensing agency after be diagnose with tumour apparently that could be remedied if his consultant provide form but he have not be able to get through to the doctor in the meantime he be trap without freedom in constituency with some of the bad public transport in the country ongoing funding issue which we know be huge challenge for the government continue to afflict brain tumour patient in number of way another constituent of mine tell their experience after be refer to care navigator follow their diagnosis the care navigator job be to contact patient on monthly basis see whether they have any problem and concern and guide they through an experience that be extremely traumatic however the care navigator position have now be cut and my constituent have be leave in the dark with grow anxiety and no one to speak to no one should be go without treatment because there be not enough equipment and no one should suffer because there be not enough staff to support they what would liberal democrats do we would recruit more cancer nurse so that every patient have dedicated specialist support they throughout their treatment for brain tumour we would like to see an improvement in diagnosis the care people receive and the range of treatment option available diagnosis target need to reflect the fact that brain cancer do not occur in stage in the way that other cancer do otherwise we risk brain tumour fall through the crack of nhs target and objective low grade brain tumour such as that suffer by madi need renew attention include in the upcoming cancer plan which we look forward to see the liberal democrats have commit to boost cancer survival rate more generally by pass cancer survival research act which would require the government to co ordinate and ensure funding for research into the cancer with the low survival rate such as brain tumour we would halve the time for new treatment to reach patient by expand the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency capacity and ensure that every patient start their treatment for cancer within that day urgent referral target we would replace age radiotherapy machine and increase their number so that no one have to travel too far for treatment measure such as margaret law which the hon member who secure this debate have press for would be an important step in the right direction to improve research in glioblastoma in particular and urge the minister to consider that too do the government have any future plan for allocate support to research into vaccine treatment for brain tumour which have reportedly show remarkable progress against glioblastoma in recent study too many patient with brain tumour have be let down by previous government over many year and hope that this government will step up and make brain tumour cancer and nhs care their no priority call the shadow minister start with personal apology to my constituent on this ve day while can not stand there in person among those mark our victory in remembrance in hinckley and bosworth in north west leicestershire be carry out the very duty that people give their life to protect the sacrifice of those who fight in world war two ensure that the work of this parliament and democracy itself endure their courage live in every free debate every vote cast and every moment we serve the public good that should never be forget or take for grant be therefore privileged to respond on behalf of his majesty opposition to such an important topic that resonate with so many brain tumour pay tribute to the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and for witney charlie maynard for bring forward this debate be also pleased to hear this important issue raise only yesterday in prime minister question by the hon member for forest of dean matt bishop talk about his constituent remarkable and inspirational story about overcome glioblastoma although the prime minister do not respond with detail about brain tumour specifically these be important opportunity to raise and debate this topic while tell the human story and look forward to hear from the minister today one such story be an example from my own constituency of hinckley and bosworth involve katherine and simon tansey and their daughter isla have tell this story in the house in year past but it be so poignant that be not shy about tell it again we can choose to be affect by the world or we can choose to affect the world and my constituent isla choose the latter in august seven year old isla tansey wake up unable to walk after many horrible treatment surgery and radiotherapy she be diagnose with dipg diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in january isla mum describe the terminal illness as the most traumatic and heartbreaking experience for family to go through sadly isla pass away in july but not before inspire thousand around the world with her positivity and creativity through her hobby paint stone and pebble isla ask other to join she by paint their own stone with any design but she ask they to include the hashtag islastone and the word and then to send picture to dedicated facebook page for she to see they be subsequently to leave the stone somewhere hide so that when they be find they could spread little bit of the joy that isla have give they isla mother katherine hop that one day child might find the stone learn about isla story and become researcher in childhood cancer thousand of people take part and more than country be involve although isla could no long walk she love to see where all the stone end up and where they would travel next this include the taj mahal new zealand disneyland and america with one stone reach antarctica through the stone and the people who make they hide they and post their photo isla travel the world the hashtag islastone grow to community of over member from all across the world in year on from isla pass world record be set at the celebration of smiles event in hinkley for the large display of paint stone with all in remembrance of isla off the back of that simon and katherine set up the islastones foundation to raise research grant awareness and smile to help fight childhood cancer they be award the points of light award from the then prime minister in why do this matter we have all hear the statistic in this debate but these be the real story behind the case and our constituent all rightly ask for real understanding for listen and for something to change be remind of the quote your life be message to the world make sure it be inspiring isla message be truly inspiring and hope the government message on cancer and brain tumour will be the same turn to the substance of the debate it be clear today that member be ask for great priority to be give to accelerate research into brain tumour and treatment the motion partly focus on the million of funding provide by the previous government for research into brain tumour and understand the frustration of mps from across the house at the speed of allocation to project since at this point must pay tribute to the tessa jowell brain cancer mission for its work with the nihr this collaboration have lead to the nihr issue funding call for researcher to evaluate treatment for brain tumour and to expand the network of trial for brain tumour include the national brain tumour consortium look over the debate notice that the minister say on second reading of the rare cancers bill in the five year since the nihr have invest million directly in brain cancer with furth million to enable brain tumour research in study involve people the commitment remain in place can confirm that there be no upper limit on that funding we be explore additional research policy option to encourage more clinical trial in early phase research and the development of medical device and diagnostic official report march vol that be of course encouraging but campaigner want to see project up and run as soon as possible to that end would the minister consider the call from brain tumour research to create set of dedicated funding stream for early career researcher improve access to clinical trial and well integration of brain tumour in cut edge cancer initiative especially give the propose abolition of nhs england it be that deep desire to get research move into potential new treatment that lead to the rare cancers bill propose by the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur the shadow secretary of state my right hon friend the member for melton and syston edward argar be pleased to support the legislation when it be introduce in march be glad to note that the bill receive government support and it be endorse by the brain tumour charity brain tumour research and other patient group welcome the bill intention to encourage industry to concentrate more research on treatment for rare and less common cancer include brain tumour particularly through the review of the orphan drug regulation however it be vital that there be alignment with the national cancer plan which be likely to set the direction of cancer policy for the next five to year can the minister confirm whether the key measure in the bill will be include in the upcoming national cancer plan as well as accelerate research into brain tumour we must take step to increase participation among those personally affected one of the aim of the rare cancers bill be to get more patient into clinical trial for rare cancer include brain tumour it be sober that the brain tumour charity survey find that only of respondent have participate in clinical trial we also know from the institute of cancer research that brain tumour clinical trial have the low recruitment of any cancer type this be why the last government ask lord to review the barrier to commercial clinical trial in the aftermath of the covid pandemic know that the government have state that they be commit to implement the recommendation of the review but can the minister provide further detail on what progress have be make to date on side note but related one at recent ve day celebration in donisthorpe meet constituent who raise with the issue of the acquire brain injury strategy that cross party initiative have be champion by the hon member for rhondda and ogmore chris bryant who be now labour minister somewhat fortuitously be able to tell my constituent that be take part in debate on brain tumour today she and the like of headway and the child brain injury trust be keen to ensure that they be able to support people through the change that the government be push through on personal independence payment and disability support so would the minister consider review or update the acquire brain injury strategy in the light of these change finally want to end on positive note the discussion between the mhra and northwest biotherapeutics be provide hope that people live with new or recurrent glioblastoma may have access to new treatment dcvax which could make real difference in prolong their survival from this terrible disease it be important that we build on these development and take step to reduce barrier to research in brain tumour and access to new treatment as they develop after all as one brain tumour survivor say hope be the anchor that keep steady through the storm of my diagnosis hope that this very debate will bring hope to those suffering and their family and will demonstrate that the government be listen and work for well outcome thank my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and the hon member for witney charlie maynard for secure this vitally important debate they have both be powerful voice in this place for more research great care and well treatment for patient with brain tumour my hon friend speak so powerfully as always and in the name of her sister margaret thank the hon member for witney for share his sister story commend she for her fundraising activity and wish she the very good the hon member ask three very clear question which hope my response will cover also thank other member who make powerful contribution in what have be very constructive debate hope my response will answer their query but if not will endeavour to write to all member follow this debate about any gap that be leave the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine speak about disparity of drug access my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell ask for and speak about the requirement for it he express the frustration of the appg and other at the speed at which we be able to make progress the hon member for strangford jim shannon speak about the importance of research and my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell speak about clinical trial the hon member for leicester south shockat adam bring his expertise on optometry to bear and speak about how useful an eye test can be the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan the liberal democrat spokesperson talk about low grade tumour commend her constituent whom she speak about for their work thank the shadow minister the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans for share the story of isla stone what powerful metaphor and powerful remembrance he also speak about the acquire brain injury strategy my remark will focus on brain tumour but can confirm that the abi strategy remain in play and in development will update the house on that as soon as possible first pay tribute to some fantastic charity for their advocacy the brain tumour charity brain tumour research cancer research uk and tom trust to name just few innovative research be vital in our fight against this devastating disease if we be to offer people the most cutting edge treatment and the high quality care the department of health and social care through the national institute for health and care research invest over billion per year in research in the past financial year alone it invest over million specifically in cancer research that have enable brain tumour study to happen in the nhs involve people in potentially life change research over the past six year since the nihr have directly invest almost million in brain tumour research project it have also spend around million on wide infrastructure investment in facility service and the research workforce make research possible in addition over five year between and the medical research council commit more than million to brain tumour research our investment be have an impact nihr fund research have show that new target drug combination treatment can give well outcome for one of the most common type of paediatric brain cancer but of course there be still so much more to do too little be know about how to prevent diagnose and manage brain tumour and they remain one of the hard cancer to treat and challenging area for research that be why we be committed to further our investment in brain cancer research and have already take some step to stimulate scientific progress would like to offer the house just three example from the past year first in september the nihr announce new package of funding opportunity for brain cancer research for both adult and child secondly in december the nihr establish new national brain tumour research consortium the consortium bring together research from range of discipline and institution to drive fast scientific advancement in how we prevent detect manage and treat brain cancer this complement the nihr dedicate funding call on research into wraparound care rehabilitation and quality of life for patient with brain tumour it have receive high volume of application and those application be under consideration by an independent expert peer review panel thirdly the department be work actively as member of the tessa jowell brain cancer mission to fully support the vision of bring the good care to all brain tumour patient in the uk together we will work with the brain tumour community to accelerate research and bring new insight to the field this summer the mission will launch the tessa jowell ally health professional research fellowship to train early career health professional in conduct vital research on how we improve patient quality of life the commitment to spend at least million on brain cancer remain in place the limit factor have not be restriction on funding or fund be spend elsewhere and every research proposal assess as be fundable have be fund my department be now focus on how we grow the scientific community work on brain cancer to get more research fund we be committed to increase spending on brain cancer research and the million target be not funding ceiling it will not end there however it be important that only high quality application be fund so that public fund be invest well and produce impactful and usable research evidence we will continue to work hand in glove with partner who fund research on new scientific discovery such as cancer research uk the medical research council and brain tumour charity we stand ready to translate these much need discovery as quickly as possible into new treatment for patient via the nihr my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden raise the issue of partnership with industry to develop treatment and can confirm that we be commit to work with the pharmaceutical industry and other with the common aim of create fast more efficient more accessible and innovative clinical treatment delivery system we expect these effort to attract more commercial investment in clinical research and to yield broad and diverse portfolio of clinical trial in the uk so that we can provide innovative treatment option for patient include those with glioblastoma the new brain tumour research consortium to which have refer will bring together people to work on that and will work to detect manage and treat rarer and less survivable cancer in child and adult clinical trial be crucial part of cancer research they be the key to advanced medical progress improve patient outcome and more hope for the future britain be already one of the good destination in the world for clinical trial but we want to go far on april the prime minister announce action to accelerate the set up and delivery of clinical trial the time take to set up study will be cut to day by march next year down from day accord to the late datum which be collect in the department of health and social care be commit to be world lead destination for clinical trial work be ongoing to streamline and reform the set up and delivery of clinical trial through digitalisation and by reduce unnecessary bureaucracy that be drive right research right set initiative and we be move from reactive to proactive portfolio management include by support the workforce and continue to embed research and innovation culture across the health and social care system the government also support the private member bill on rare cancer bring forward by my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur the bill will make it easy for clinical trial on rare cancer to take place in england by ensure that the patient population can be easily contact this government be commit to back innovative clinical research ecosystem in the uk so that british patient can be among the first to benefit we will bust bureaucracy fast track clinical trial and give patient improve access to cutting edge treatment and technology include for brain tumour be part of research be our landmark service allow people from all walk of life across the uk to find and participate in research relevant to they which could transform life urge everybody watch at home to sign up to be part of research and to get involve we have speak about medicine repurpose whereby medicine approve for particular condition be use in new way to treat different condition repurpose drug may have particular value for rare cancer such as brain cancer for which drug development have be limit as my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden note nhs england have suspend its medicine repurpose programme but not because it be unimportant it have show that opportunity to use exist medicine in new way can be deliver without the support of formal repurposing programme include for example through local off label prescribing this create opportunity for nihr and other funder to support proposal for clinical trial that use repurpose drug for rare cancer we will help researcher work with industry and clinician to strengthen the evidence base for new drug and for new us of drug so that we can find out how patient can well be help how well will that work be co ordinated if it be do on local sporadic basis and how will the repurposing of drug be co ordinated centrally if nhs england be no long undertake that work nhs england have find that create that environment do not necessarily provide new and well way of repurpose drug and that can be do far more efficiently and far less bureaucratically by use local off label prescribing we be look at how we can incentivise researcher and clinical trial to explore repurpose drug we be determined to make the nihr and other funder grasp opportunity to support those proposal we will help researcher work with industry and clinician to strengthen the evidence base for new drug the nhs be work hard to diagnose and treat cancer on time there be more to do on early diagnosis and fast treatment in order to improve patient experience and survival the nhs be focus on improve diagnostic waiting time and on provide mri ct and other test to reduce cancer wait because as lord darzi investigation have show we face significant challenge if we be to bring this country cancer survival rate back up to the standard of the good in the world we know that the good way to improve survival for those with brain tumour and with all cancer be to diagnose patient early and treat they quickly in our first six month more patient receive diagnosis or an all clear within day than do in the previous year thank to investment in cut nhs waiting list in march more than of patient in england refer for cancer have it rule out or diagnose within day it be the first time that target have be meet in report june vol correction but we must go far and we will our reform to cancer care will see more than people diagnose fast and thousand more start treatment within two month across the nhs there be no single solution to this complex challenge that be why my right hon friend the secretary of state have be clear that there will be national cancer plan publish later this year this plan will ensure that rare cancer include brain cancer will not be leave behind it be my absolute privilege as person with cancer to be drive that cancer plan be delighted that we have so far receive more than representation as part of the call for evidence can assure my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden that her contribution and all other will be take seriously the liberal democrat spokesperson also talk about low grade cancer there be difference between staging and grading and it be important that we be clear about that low grade brain tumour be consider non cancerous

the eight subsequent decade in the come year the government of the united kingdom will continue to work to secure international agreement that uphold our national interest for all those reason commend the statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank you for ensure that the house have the opportunity to hear this statement today mr speaker free trade better we all it have lift billion from poverty and have make we the country we be today and the country that have the ability to join the fight for europe freedom year ago unfortunately this be not the historic free trade deal we be promise any reduction in tariff be welcome but british business be still face high tariff now than they do in february this be not the deal we be promise and the government still have much work to do let we be crystal clear it be our freedom to make our own trade policy that make even today deal possible hope the government be now convert to our cause and regret the time they try to take we back into the european union as the government limber up for their surrender summit later this month ask the minister to rule out today once and for all any form of dynamic alignment we be the only party whose position on trade with the united states have be consistent when the conservatives publish the opportunity for deal in the now prime minister say he would never countenance an agreement the now education secretary call it foolish and the now energy secretary say it be spectre hang over we the conservatives do welcome the news of reduction in select tariff on thing like automotive export and steel today any reduction be well than no reduction job and investment be at risk and all mitigation be to be welcome however if have understand the minister correctly we be still not back to the position as it be at the beginning of february perhaps he can clarify that british good will still be more expensive in the us than they be before for all the talk of the special relationship that put we in the same category as country like burundi and bhutan more than what be in this deal today be what be not from the little the government have share it be clear that it do not go anywhere near far enough it be diet coke deal not the real thing it be not the comprehensive free trade agreement that true plan for growth require what about the film and television industry which be be threaten early this week with tariff can the minister assure we now that there will be no such imposition what be the price of this deal will the minister set out clearly to the house the trade off that have be make note with concern that two day on we have still not have sight of the detail of the uk india trade deal will the minister confirm when we can expect to see the full detail of both deal how do this deal defend our beef lamb pork and poultry farmer with not just word but action do it protect the special status of northern ireland and do it cover the british overseas territory in the meantime while business continue to suffer and struggle with elevated us tariff and as they face quota and uncertainty will the minister finally take step with his colleague to ease the burden his government choose to impose on they will he announce pause of the devastating job tax until full trade agreement can be conclude and stop the surge in business rate so many business be face and will he finally shelve the unemployment bill that be already see british business cut job and choke under page of incoming red tape lastly will he ask the prime minister to sack his energy secretary and finally produce real policy to cut energy price to globally competitive level if the government be serious about help business now be the time what we see be that once again when labour negotiate britain lose where to begin mr speaker as seek to reflect in my statement and as the prime minister remark only few minute ago this be job save not job do it be significant that two former conservative prime ministers the former members for henley and for maidenhead as recollect seek and fail to deliver us trade deal in the same way that the former government fail to deliver deal with india important though it be to hear the view of the opposition about trade deal that be not do think it be also important to hear from the government about trade deal that have actually be do be grateful none the less that the shadow secretary of state find it in himself to welcome the tariff reduction that have be achieve think there will be relief at jlr in particular this evening that the calm cool head approach take by the prime minister and the negotiator have yield significant reduction of tariff to critical supply chain and critical set of british exporter on brexit respectfully say that this house have debate brexit innumerable time over the year since simply observe that we as government be more interested in new market than in old argument and that there have be plenty of opportunity to rehearse those old argument can also assure the house that as we look ahead to the first eu uk summit on may have deliver deal with india and the united states we be now look to reset that relationship with our friend neighbour and partner in the eu not least because three of our five large trading partner be actually member of the european union on the specific point about the film industry we continue to negotiate on the uk the shadow secretary of state who be chuntere from sedentary position seem to suggest that we can unilaterally declare the policy of the united states negotiation involve two party that be lesson that the conservatives could have learn when they fail to secure us trade deal in the past it be by listen and work together with our partner in the united states that we have be able to make progress today as the prime minister say this be job save not job do there be further work to be do and we fully intend to take that work forward on agriculture think it be important to say that the red line that we maintain consistently in relation to sps measure have be protect be grateful to have the minister for food security and rural affairs on the front bench with we have maintain those critical animal welfare standard all of the speculation in relation to chlorinate chicken or hormone inject beef have turn out to be unfounded it be important to recognise what be agree today let be clear to the house this agreement will provide the united states with an initial tariff rate quota on beef of tonne increase by tonne per year to cap of tonne let put that in context for the house and for those on the conservative front bench the previous government agree under the uk australia fta to beef tariff rate quota of tonne per year which incrementally increase to wait for tonne per year and ultimately become unlimited subject to the safeguard regime sense of balance proportion and understanding be require when discuss not only the safeguard that have be maintain and protect by the british government but the deal that have be strike in relation to beef we need to keep the market access grant to the united states in the context of the wide economic benefit that this deal have secure for the united kingdom on the rather diminish political point that the shadow secretary of state seek to make in relation to domestic legislation can assure he that the domestic legislation and the programme of the british government remain unchanged as consequence of today landmark deal as far as be aware that be also the case in relation to the membership of the cabinet be very relieved to say that it be the prime minister who be in charge of choose member of the cabinet not the conservative party although the shadow secretary of state do have distinguished record of service alongside liz truss in previous government call the chair of the business and trade committee thank you mr speaker for help to ensure that this moment be possible let add my congratulation to my right hon friend and to his majesty ambassador in washington lord mandelson for get this deal do it would appear tonight that small common sense retreat on duty and agriculture have unlock major reprieve for ten of thousand of job in our car and steel industry will the minister clarify for we tonight when those tariff reduction will kick in will he confirm that there be nothing in this bargain that compromise our ability to strike the bold of reset with the european union it would be mistake to strengthen transatlantic relationship and then short change cross channel possibility can the minister confirm that he will facilitate debate in this house if not vote on the treaty on tuesday will recommend to the select committee that we commence full inquiry into this treaty so that we can report back to the house but vote would help we understand who stand where in stand up and protect british job let begin by pay tribute to my right hon friend long stand interest in jaguar land rover and the wide west midland economy and to the diligent and demand work he do on the business and trade committee which make major contribution to not only trade policy but business policy here in the united kingdom to clarify the point my right hon friend make on the auto industry the uk export around car year to the united states and this quota will ensure that most manufacturer now pay the preferential rate the agreement have remove the tariff that the us apply to uk car on april the agreement have be welcome by the uk auto industry in the last couple of hour include by jaguar land rover which be the large exporter to the us we be committed to continue to support the automotive industry which be point my right hon friend have make powerfully in recent day on his second point can assure my right hon friend that notwithstanding the significant progress we have make in relation to the united states as say job save but job not yet do great deal of work be continue on the uk eu summit that be due to take place on may he be right to recognise the importance of twin track our approach as it be by recognise the salience and significance of the united states as the country that be comfortably our large single trading partner while recognise the european union as our large trading bloc which cover about of our trade turn to the economic security aspect of the deal pay particular tribute to the work of my right hon friend as know this issue have be of great interest to the business and trade committee think he will take lot of encouragement from what emerge in the agreement specifically in relation to export control and investment security one might almost think that the negotiator have be read his substack call the liberal democrat spokesperson sadly the world have change dramatically in the few month since donald trump take office in the white house we need to reflect on the share value we have with key country across the world we need to look to canada and stand up to trump as it have do and we need to make sure that we build economic relationship with country such as canada australia and the country in the european union all country that share our value be pleased that the minister speak of scrutiny because we must ensure that there be scrutiny we need vote in this house on these proposal we need to protect the nhs and ensure that we be not sell our farmer down the river we must also ensure that there be no cut to taxis on high tech industry which the us may be push for will the minister address the matter of vote in this house that would be extremely helpful donald trump tend to be weathervane and he could come back for more also feel for our pharmaceutical industry so what assurance can the minister give they thank the hon gentleman for his question on the case he make for see trade as not simply bilateral issue but multilateral issue think there be broad consensus across the house as well as the work we have take forward in relation to the united states today we continue to work with friend and partner in range of different fora include the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and the european union on his specific question about scrutiny of trade within this house echo the confirmation that the prime minister give in the commons only few day ago that we be not anticipate any change to the process of scrutiny for trade matter in the house on the two substantive political point first it be worth the house recognise that there be no change to the united kingdom digital service tax as consequence of the agreement reach today secondly know that there have be widespread concern not only on the liberal democrat benches but right across the house about measure to tackle the evil of online harm but can confirm again there have be no change as consequence of the agreement reach with the united states order thank the minister for come forward with his statement but the table office have not receive copy of it be wonder where it be and when we will see copy of it can it be hand in so we can get it print for member let we move on to dame meg hillier add my congratulation to the secretary of state and the team at the department as well as our team of official under lord mandelson in washington this be major step forward in short time give how long trade agreement normally take this be an impressive step however as have be mention we know that president trump have make rattle sound about tariff on the film industry the creative and technical business in my constituency who contribute to our film industry be obviously nervous about that will the minister reassure we that he be put his shoulder to the wheel on this issue and not rest on his laurel on the triumph achieve so far mr speaker on your point apologise again for the statement not be available as be clear from my initial remark there be some confusion within government as to the good way to proceed but hope that through my official we will provide it to you as matter of immediacy order just so that we completely understand the government decide they be make statement so there be no possibility of anything else the house be suspend and have to resume we could not leave it in limbo forever the point be that there be statement come thankfully the minister make statement hopefully we can get copy of the statement to everyone be bother about we be in danger of send people home say that there be to be no statement that be never ever the case be disappointed that member be advise to leave the building minute ago on the claim that there be to be no statement mr speaker the responsibility be ours and for that apologise hope that through my official we will be able to furnish the house with the statement that be request in relation to my hon friend question assure she that it be not my personal style or the departmental habit to rest on laurel it will not have pass her notice that it have be somewhat busy few month in relation to trade policy not least give the historic change in the global trading environment we be experience on daily basis notwithstanding that turbulence and the challenge in relation to trade policy it be matter of quiet satisfaction that we be able to get the india deal over the line early this week through that process of quiet engaged diligent diplomacy and great deal of hard work by official negotiator and other we have be able to secure this agreement today but assure she that the work go on call the father of the house in the trumpian philosophy that be the art of the deal you bully your opponent and then two month later withdraw some of the threat and they kneel down in adoration while they be reduce to where they be before that be where we be we be celebrate the end of the second world war before the second world war people could walk from lincoln to grimsby across derelict farm want real assurance from the minister that he will protect our beef farmer because this be the start of an attack by america on our beef farmer as so often in the past the government will always act in the national interest in protect britain farmer and our food security would rehearse the number that share if the right hon member be concerned about the volume of access to the uk market respectfully suggest that that might be question for he to direct to his conservative front benchers under the uk australia free trade agreement beef tariff quota of tonne year be agree which increase to tonne after year in contrast what have be agree with the united states today will provide it with an initial tariff quota on beef of tonne rise by tonne year to cap of tonne in relation to the right hon member observation on the art of the be great deal of commentary on that in pretty much every newspaper at the moment my compass tend to be the art of war by sun tzu rather than the art of the deal sun tzu as the right hon member as learned and wise individual will be aware say tactic without strategy be the noise before defeat observe that in the eight year since brexit the previous government do not publish trade strategy like bus we wait age year for trade deal with major global partner and then two come along at once within week it be major vote of confidence for the position of great britain on the global stage with bit of déjà vu commend again the minister the labour government and in particular the prime minister for the calm and collect manner in which they have consolidate this agreement when by the way other fail for year while market be up and tariff be significantly down because of the announcement of this agreement will the minister confirm how this uk us trade deal will benefit my slough constituent and lead to economic growth and job as former secretary of state for transport be always nervous as to whether bus turn up or not but appreciate the analogy it have be busy week for the government and for the department for business and trade but it be right to recognise that by happy coincidence we have see both the india and us deal agree within couple of day however those couple of day be precede by many month of quiet work and diplomacy and that be why my hon friend be entirely right to recognise the prime minister personal contribution to the agreement with prime minister modi and now with president trump after the clown show that we have witness in recent year and the cavalcade of chaos that we see under previous government when see that image of the prime minister sit alongside president trump in the oval office couple of month back feel what judge be widespread sentiment among the british public which be sense of relief that we have serious man in what be undoubtedly serious time the serious man the serious prime minister have engage in serious diplomacy to get to this agreement today and as he recognise with the reduction in tariff that have be secure not least in relation to the auto industry and the supply chain that stretch to many part of the united kingdom there will be significant benefit for the united kingdom as result welcome this deal the politic and detail aside it be worth acknowledge that the prime minister strategy towards the us low key diplomacy mediation lead over the past few month have lead the united kingdom to the front of the queue in addition to peter mandelson would thank varun chandra civil servant and other for get we to this position what practical support can the minister provide in assistance for business and farmer in north yorkshire to take advantage of this deal let pay tribute to the right hon gentleman notice his tweet be not sure if one call it that or early this afternoon which reflect his question and which speak to wisdom maturity and experience in recognise the british government work genuinely appreciate the graciousness with which he make that public observation even before do so in the chamber echo exactly the sentiment that the right hon gentleman have describe in relation not just to the prime minister the secretary of state for business and trade and ministers but to those individual in the british system both in washington and in london who have be work pretty much flat out to try to secure an outcome to the benefit of the united kingdom on the opportunity for british farmer the right hon gentleman be right to recognise that far from some of the concern that we have hear from member on the front bench there be significant opportunity for the uk give the reciprocal character of the agreement reach today we will work as the department of business and trade with our colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs to ensure that british farmer be fully apprise of the opportunity that the new market access potentially offer to they may congratulate my right hon friend and his team on the second major trade deal in matter of day our agricultural sector our automotive sector and our steel sector will all be grateful have learn to be wary of enthusiastic post from president trump on the subject of trade but this really do seem to be win win win as my right hon friend say there be more to be do and negotiation carry on will he confirm as the minister for future digital economy and online safety do to my select committee that online harm be not on the negotiating table can he say whether the digital service tax be on the negotiating table can he also say little bit about the issue about labour practice that he mention in his statement thank my hon friend for her focus and concern regard both the work on online harm and the digital service tax as seek to reflect early those remain undisturbed and unchanged by this agreement we have listen carefully to the concern from different part of the house on online harm and we have work hard to advance the uk national interest in the agreement that be reach be also grateful to my hon friend for recognise the significance of the move in tariff in relation to steel and aluminium which again represent significant benefit to the foundation of the uk economy in that sense we work hard in the course of this deal not just for automotive and the supply chain but for steel and aluminium one area that be important to this country and worth billion of pound be defence what change will the deal bring to the propose defence industrial strategy for the big prime and for small and medium sized enterprise which this government and all of we want to support only in recent day have be involve in discussion notwithstanding the work we have be do on india and the united states in relation to the defence component of the industrial strategy we aim to bring the industrial strategy and its defence component to the public in the come week and month huge amount of work be happen within government the hon member be right to recognise that one of the challenge be how we can have defence procurement in the united kingdom that do not simply reward some of our outstanding prime but recognise that the character of modern warfare be change whereby we be move from small number of large platform be the central feature to large number of small platform we can look for example at drone technology in ukraine and the transformative effect on the battlespace we be therefore deeply mindful of the point he make we need to ensure in term of defence procurement that we have whole economy effort that recognise not least the digital and technological contribution of modern warfare digital be key part of the agreement we have reach today and we will work closely with the united states to advance our share interest thank you for make this statement possible mr speaker welcome this statement and congratulate the minister the labour government and all our official in the uk and us who have work incredibly hard on this as he say over several month say in the statement on the india free trade deal early this week that this be in contrast to the abject failure of the conservatives who do not deliver any deal at all yesterday the mayor of the west midlands richard parker publish report prepare by steve rigby of the rigby group which detail hit of billion to the west midland gdp from us automotive tariff the report also say that deal within day be absolutely essential and that an imperfect deal be well than delay deal do the minister agree that this deal be total vindication of the prime minister approach to work in the spirit of co operation with our partner in the usa and europe to deliver deal that would benefit the whole of the uk let first pay tribute to my hon friend for his tireless effort in promote the economic development of and opportunity for his constituency last speak with richard parker only two or three week ago when we be together be fully aware not least give his background with pwc as recollect that he be deeply invest in economic development and the opportunity for the west midland and he have bring that commercial acuman to bear already in office on the west midland perhaps the signature feature of today announcement will be the benefit accrue to jaguar land rover as well as to other luxury car exporter to the united states give the scale of jaguar land rover production within the united kingdom and the reliance on the us market it be critical that we work under the huge pressure of time to deliver cut in tariff affect auto in that sense the quota agree today and the reduction in the tariff level will be real and meaningful benefit to jlr and its supply chain may congratulate the prime minister on this trade deal it be an historic moment believe that it be in the national interest but of course we will have to see the detail and the devil be in the detail it appear from the statement that there be lot of detail still to be work out also pay tribute to lord mandelson our ambassador in the united states the minister mention manage to keep red line around hormone rear beef and chlorinate chicken and of course that be mention by the shadow minister the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith he also mention lamb do not think the minister mention lamb which be important to shropshire farmer what have not be mention be antibiotic in pig this nation eat lot of pork lot of that be rear in shropshire could the minister assure shropshire and british farmer that the pig industry in this country be still safe as result of this deal hope can give the right hon gentleman the assurance that he seek the sps arrangement be as say an absolute red line for the united kingdom we be keen both in public and in private to reinforce the government continue focus on uphold animal welfare standard here in the united kingdom in relation to his broad point about the deal be grateful that he have bring his experience and expertise to bear in the house in his judgment that go by even this initial setting out of the deal it be clearly in the national interest that we be in position to have quota allow reduce rate for the export of uk car for example we would otherwise have be look at very serious consequence for major british manufacturer be grateful to he for his generous word will ensure that lord mandelson as be now oblige to call he be make aware of the right hon gentleman generous tribute he be never averse to receive compliment commend the minister for his statement and wish to put on record my thank to he the prime minister and our excellent trade negotiator the minister have speak lot about tariff so far but might he talk about the non tariff and non quota trade barrier to further economic development between the united kingdom and the united states and about where we will go in the ongoing negotiation it have be feature of the last few month since the president be elect that people have think that trade policy and tariff be synonymous my hon friend be exactly right to recognise that grow proportion of trade be conduct electronically the uk be an almost service base economy we therefore have huge interest in non tariff barrier not just barrier at the border but barrier behind the border that be an area of focus in the agreement and one that will require further work as be appropriate and right we be work under huge time pressure to address the tariff issue for the reason have set out but he be entirely right to recognise that we will take forward an ambitious agenda on non tariff barrier although reduction in tariff be welcome the past four month have show the uk government that president trump be an unreliable partner not just in trade but in defence and security climate and the international rule of law in contrast close relation with our trust ally in the eu have never be more important give that trump have previously describe the eu as foe very nasty and an atrocity will the minister provide an unequivocal assurance that there be no condition whatsoever attach to the deal that will constrain the uk relationship with the eu which be the uk large trading partner can do no well than refer to the prime minister mansion house speech towards the end of last year when he say clearly that we do not want to have to choose between our friend and ally between deal and work constructively with the european union and with the united states on the hon gentleman broad point it be important to recognise that the united states be our deep and strong defence ally for the past year we should remember the day on which we be gather the united kingdom have work hand in glove with the armed force of the united states to keep the world safe see for myself in previous conflict such as afghanistan the extraordinary heroism and courage that american service personnel bring to bear alongside british personnel so it be right to recognise that as well as take forward this economic agreement there be strong and endure security foundation to the relationship between the united states and the united kingdom all that say of course we stand ready to work with the european union as we look ahead to the uk eu summit on may the hon gentleman ask whether there be any condition the single big concern express by many commentator relate to sps give that that be one of the key agricultural area on which the previous government founder in their negotiation with the first trump administration that be red line for we in these negotiation red line that be glad to

will be as mere minister of trade be not sure the treasury would look kindly on tell the obr when to update its forecast be trade minister not treasury minister but have note the hon lady observation she be entirely right that the economic landscape have change it be right to recognise that many of the promise that be make in the past about we see major trading bloc bring barrier down have be set aside in recent month and year and we be see major trading bloc put barrier up that be why today deal be so significant congratulate the minister and this labour government on achieve not just one trade deal but two historic deal in the space of week be vegetarian but many of my constituent like nothing well than chicken curry on the street of southall broadway can the minister categorically assure the house that this deal will protect our british food standard and in particular that chlorinate chicken and hormone inject beef will remain illegal in this country first be grateful for the catch all congratulation to the whole government it be sentiment heartily endorse and will ensure it be hear by other colleague in relation to my hon friend substantive point can assure she that curry

and hormone inject beef there be lot of genuine concern before this agreement be reach today and can give the house the assurance she be seek that there be nothing in this deal that compromise the safety standard of either poultry or beef we be clear that that be red line and we have deliver on that red line thank the minister for his statement there have be great deal of reassurance for the car industry and agriculture but there have be no mention of the scotch whisky industry or the drink and food industry in general in edinburgh as in much of scotland that be huge concern should we expect detail next week or be there assurance he can give we now the hon lady be entirely right to raise the importance of the scotch whisky industry and say that as member with constituency interest have the glenkinchie distillery in my east lothian constituency which be delighted to say the chancellor of the exchequer visit this week in the light of the deal that be strike with india in relation to this deal with the united states it be right to recognise that further work and negotiation will continue not least in relation to some of the broad sector that it do not cover it be also right to recognise in this week of all week the extraordinary significance of the indian trade deal that be strike for the scotch whisky association member need not take my word for it they can look at the word of the chief executive of the scotch whisky association who describe in glow term the significance of the indian market and the precipitate decline in the tariff that we have secure in that deal we have more to do but broadly this have be recognise as very significant and positive week not just for scottish whisky but for scottish salmon and be delighted to say irn bru which will also benefit from access to the indian market in the vatican in the last hour the cardinal have elect new pope and we wish the new holy father well and give thank for the life of pope francis of course we send our good wish to the catholic community in newcastle under lyme and up and down our united kingdom welcome the minister statement and the confirmation that he have give several time to colleague that import of hormone treat beef and chlorinate chicken will remain illegal under this deal that be good news and important for my farmer in newcastle under lyme and farmer up and down the country will the minister expand little far on what exact engagement take place with farmer and their representative before this deal be agree and what support will be pledge to farmer now because that be important to my farmer and those up and down the country fully appreciate my hon friend observation be unaware on arrive in the chamber that successor to pope francis who be greatly grieve and miss on both side of the house have now be announce and of course we wish the new pontiff well in the spiritual leadership that role will require and say that as proud presbyterian and member of the church of scotland on the broad point about engagement with farmer also have farming constituency and be on farm in east lothian only last friday hear directly from farmer about the impact of the market challenge face by farmer not just here but internationally through our colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs there be lot of engagement regularly with farmer naturally and appropriately that department be involve in the cross whitehall process that lead to the negotiator be able to reach agreement today and fully anticipate further opportunity for dialogue with farmer in the future we have have huge amount of tariff put on the uk and then trade deal to reduce they there have be positive impact on some industry and potentially negative impact on other today announcement of uk us trade deal have therefore give rise to more question than answer on one side we have us official hail the deal as dramatically increase access to the uk agricultural market which be sure will ring alarm bell for many on the other side we have the uk government claim that the agreement be balanced and fair first will the minister categorially confirm that no reduction to uk food standard environmental protection which have not be mention yet and animal welfare rule have be concede in this agreement secondly what be the true impact of the tariff arrangement on british farmer and grower we have hear vague claim of reciprocal access but have the government conduct any assessment of the economic impact for uk farmer their practice and their opportunity listen carefully to the hon gentleman comment and early on he mention trade deal to reduce tariff that be exactly the deal we have seek to secure and have secure today he be right to recognise that there be continue challenge not just for the uk but for many country in relation to protectionism and high tariff rate but today represent significant progress on the term as have describe on animal welfare and food standard reassure he about everything have say on sanitary and phytosanitary measure we make that red line and be very clear about it and be unwilling to compromise also assure he that there be nothing vague about the reciprocity describe in term of the opportunity for beef farmer be grateful to the minister for his confirmation that this deal will not in any way undermine the nation sps rule and regulation but be sure that he will acknowledge that there will be degree of nervousness among british and indeed welsh farmer especially beef farmer for although the tariff rate quota agree be modest compare with that agree under the new zealand and australia trade deal it do of course come as an addition and farmer will be worried about the cumulative impact think the minister have mention this but will he confirm that the tonne represent the maximum tariff quota for beef that have be agree and have any tariff quota be agree for lamb pork and poultry forgive be shuffle through my paper and miss the hon gentleman final point but be happy to write to he he be absolutely right can assure he to recognise that compare to the tariff quota agree under the australia deal negotiate by the then prime minister the former member for henley there be much more proportionality much more modest increase anticipate under the quota in the agreement reach today recognise his point that there be continue challenge for farmer in the united kingdom and we will continue to seek to address those welcome the minister clarification on chlorine wash chicken and hormone treat beef but will there be protection in place for egg product hen raise in battery cage be illegal in this country but not elsewhere in the world so will it be illegal to import egg product from hen raise in those poor condition elsewhere we have not compromise our animal welfare standard in any aspect of what we have agree on behalf of the united kingdom today thank you mr speaker for drag the minister to the house tonight to explain the term of the deal after hammer farm with the family farm tax it now look like labour be sell our farmer down the river allow cheap low quality import from the united states president trump secretary of agriculture have say this deal put our great american agricultural producers first be she wrong it be hardly surprise that member of the trump administration should talk about america first can assure the hon gentleman that the north star by which we have negotiate be the uk national interest today agreement reflect the quiet but determined diplomacy of serious prime minister to deliver deal the hon gentleman party do not have great track record on serious prime ministers or on beef quota to put today announcement in context the hon gentleman government agree to uk australia fta with beef tariff rate quota of tonne per year that might be point that he want to make to farmer in the borders welsh farmer have be reap the reward of high beef price over the past few year that have be the one piece of good news in the industry they now hear that another government have sign another trade deal allow even more beef import into our country why have the government decide to include beef import in the deal and to kick our farmer in the tooth again simply do not recognise the aeriate contribution that the hon gentleman have make he have an important and legitimate role in represent farmer in his constituency and more broadly but assure he that if he look at the number include the quota agree by the previous government and the relatively modest shift in the tariff rate quota on beef that have be agree today his concern will be allay hope that the minister will recognise why uk farmer might raise an eyebrow at the assurance that he have give to the house they have be let down time and again since july through this government policy on the family farm tax the sustainable farming incentive double cab pick up and fertiliser tax the list go on and on brooke rollins the us secretary of agriculture say after the deal be announce that it can be understate how important this deal be for american farmer and that it will exponentially increase us beef export to the uk the minister will understand why that raise concern for our farmer will he assure farmer up and down the country that in any further trade negotiation with the us their interest livelihood and future will not be on the table it would be remiss of not to start my answer to the hon lady with anything other than humble congratulation on her time in the london marathon have run it twice would have see she at the starting line but that would have be the last time see she it be minor consolation to that my time be somewhat fast than that of the shadow justice secretary the right hon member for newark robert jenrick all that be say she make serious point about british farmer assure she that the interest of british farmer rural britain and the wide agricultural sector be constant feature of our thinking in government despite the reassurance from the minister many farmer in glastonbury and somerton will feel really anxious about be throw under bus yet again as result of this trade deal especially after the trade deal agree by former conservative governments with australia and new zealand which undermine british farmer and food standard can the minister give cast iron guarantee that this deal with the us will not undermine british farmer what measure will he put in place to ensure that low quality low welfare product do not enter the uk reiterate the point that seek to make early import of hormone treat beef or chlorinate chicken will remain illegal the deal we have sign today will protect british farmer and uphold our high standard of welfare and environmental standard any agricultural import come into the united kingdom will have to meet our high and continue sps standard can put it no more clearly than that east hampshire farmer will be relieve to hear what the minister have say about food standard include on hormone treat beef and chlorinate chicken after everything that have happen to they in the last period obviously we will have to see the detail and see what else be in the agreement will ask about online safety the minister have say already that there have be no change to the digital service tax and no rowing back on the online safety regulatory regime can he confirm that no commitment have be make that would curtail the freedom of this house to make further change in this area on today of all day will not suggest that there should be any fetter or constraint whatsoever on this house when it come to introduce legislation on online harm or any other issue can just say that never want to be put in this position again remind people that before we send members home we ought to think to tell they that there will not be statement think that be bad the chair of the select committee complain to because he be tell to go away we should not be do this in this house we need to work together this house should be respect will stand up for the back benchers please never put in this position again on behalf of this house and all the roman catholics across the united kingdom particularly in chorley and lancashire wish the new pope well adjournment resolved that this house do now mather house adjourn
