child minister since the end of august but in the two year before be appoint to that position the issue of parent and teacher be unable to get the support they need for child with send be already in the top two item in my casework and surgery appointment pay my own tribute to all the staff support child with special educational need in school college and alternative provision both locally and nationally the issue raise in the debate be very familiar to in previous debate have talk about parent have what they feel be war of attrition with the system to try to get the support they need for their child that be war that any parent would wage but no parent should have to we know the system be not deliver consistent support and outcome and that there be significant financial pressure on it despite considerable government investment will begin with investment and funding as that have be the big issue discuss this afternoon as have be touch on the government have increase the high need budget considerably in it will be billion which be high than the figure in in the past two year there have be increase in per head funding in the constituency of my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden most member would agree that that be considerable amount of money as my hon friend the member for bracknell james sunderland say in his speech some member may only agree with that privately but not many government budget under any government or in any area have increase by which demonstrate the government considerable support for and commitment to the area we have two programme support local authority that face financial pressure in their send system and number of member in the chamber have local authority involve in those programme first the safety valve programme which include local authority with the high percentage deficit help local authority pay down accumulate deficit and reform their system by march the department will have allocate nearly million through that programme and if what we be try to deliver be deliver those deficit will be eradicate secondly we have the deliver well value programme for those with substantial but less severe deficit which involve local authority include east riding of yorkshire in the area of my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden that be help to deliver high quality outcome with sustainable cost under that programme each area develop reform plan and receive million to support its delivery as have be touch on the high need budget have double since but even if government be able to triple or quadruple it that would not by itself deliver the outcome we all want to see parent and teacher know that and frequently say that the issue be not just about money my hon friend the member for mansfield ben bradley make that point well in his speech and intend to pick up with he the discussion about conflict priority the system need reform which be why we publish our send and alternative provision improvement plan last year with the aim of get child and young people the right support in the right place at the right time there be lot within the plan but wish to draw out three key area briefly because they be the one that have come up most this afternoon and be in the petition attach to this debate first on special school provision and capital funding which be raise by the hon member for harrow west gareth thomas and other we be make billion investment billion of which have already be allocate that be on top of our delivery of new special and alternative provision free school there be currently special free school open and further have be approve to open in the future secondly on combat regional variation the plan will move we towards national system with national standard which we have never previously have across the country we now have nine change programme partnership which each have between two and four local area together with local school health service and parent what they be do be for example test an ehcp template that we hope can be use nationally which will improve the timeliness and quality of ehcp we be develop national standard of support for special educational need begin with one for speech and language which will be release later this year we be also publish local and national inclusion dashboard which parent will be able to access they will be able to see how their local area be do which will drive accountability thirdly my hon friend the member for torbay kevin foster ask about the skill and knowledge of staff in mainstream school our teacher standard already include clear expectation that teacher must understand the need of all pupil include those with special educational need but we be review the core content framework and the early career framework to improve their confidence in this area we have universal send service programme which more than staff have already access to improve their knowledge and skill we be also fund the training of early year staff with level senco qualification as my hon friend the chair of the education committee say some staff have begin that training so we be on track with that target there be many other point that want to respond to but have only eight minute so will just say to my right hon friend the member for west suffolk matt hancock and my hon friend the members for tewkesbury mr robertson for south west bedfordshire andrew selous for gedling tom randall for waveney peter aldous for aylesbury rob butler and other that understand their point about regional variation it be base partly on deprivation and other factor and partly on the historical spend factor that have be refer to be happy to sit down with anybody to talk about those thing to the hon member for sheffield hallam olivia blake say that it be already the case that school have to be outstanding in all area to receive an outstanding grade from ofsted and it be not the case that we have target for reduce ehcp or indeed any other such target in conclusion reiterate my thank to my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden for secure this debate and to all member who have contribute to it we may disagree on certain aspect of how to achieve this but we be unite in our desire to ensure that the send system provide excellent outcome to all child and young people and that be what this government be determined to deliver
