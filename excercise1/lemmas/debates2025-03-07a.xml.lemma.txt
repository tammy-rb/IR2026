could not agree with my hon friend more edinburgh have thrive space sector as do scotland my hon friend have for many year be heavily involve in work to grow the economy in edinburgh and the borders and pay tribute to he for that must however take this opportunity to pick minor bone with my hon friend he mention that glasgow do not have castle and wish to correct the record we have fine ruin castle call crookston castle it be the second old building in glasgow the first old building in glasgow be the beautiful cathedral will not indulge in dispute about whether edinburgh or glasgow be the well city they be both beautiful great city glasgow be slightly well but there you be be oblige to my hon friend for his intervention and be also glad to be able to correct that point there be another reason why it be important that we have thrive space and satellite industry space be critical to defence and we must have thrive space sector to protect our country the united kingdom work with ally to ensure that our interest be defend in space however the world be become more unstable and it be essential that we have our own capability to launch and operate satellite from the united kingdom and this bill be important in that regard too it will help to secure vibrant end to end space industry in the united kingdom and that be important for defence to take one example have our own domestic launch capability be important and vibrant civilian sector will help to cover the cost of that launch capability this bill also have national security theme owe to much hard work include by the last government the uk space agency and many other the united kingdom also have firm foundation for thriving space industry in the time available can not provide complete survey of the vibrant and grow space industry but here be some key point one key task we have have be to develop our own launch capability to put satellite up in space and then to get they back down that be why there be so much chat about spaceport in my life at least saxavord the uk spaceport in the shetland islands be one of only two license vertical launch spaceport in europe that be at the far end of the north of the map of our family of nation down in the far south west we also have an operational spaceport in cornwall that illustrate that space be an opportunity for our family of nation from the very top to the very bottom mean that only in cartographic sense be not look to offend any member from cornwall there be also spaceport under construction and plan in sutherland on the far north of the coast of scotland to the west of thurso north uist wonderful place which commend as spend much of my honeymoon there glasgow prestwick spaceport machrihanish on the southern tip of the argyll peninsula which would also recommend for visit to scotland and snowdonia some may wonder where those place be they be all wonderful place and they illustrate that space be an opportunity across the united kingdom let we turn to the satellite or as lou reed sing satellite of love the uk have incredible talent in manufacturing satellite and satellite technology as scottish mp focus on scotland and as glasgow mp focus on glasgow but let we start in the moray firth where my mother come from it have fine tradition of engineering for those who follow highland league football suspect be in minority of one in the house today the fact that forres mechanics be one of the old football club in the north of scotland point to tradition of engineering there the jones shipyard in buckie be another great engineering industry in the north of scotland of significantly more relevance to this debate be that forres be home to orbex which be develop rocket call prime it will be the first uk manufacture and uk launch orbital rocket prime be set to take off from saxavord in prime be set to take off from saxavord in the uk government have recently announce million investment in orbex an important investment that demonstrate the opportunity be bring to the north of scotland for which we need to redouble our effort to secure economic growth and prosperity my home city of glasgow have rich history of innovation and an incredibly promising cluster of space expertise as glasgow mp be determined that it should have bright future in space glasgow be build more satellite than any other city in europe there be fantastic company in the area include alba orbital which specialise in pocketqube satellite aac clyde space which have expertise in small satellite technology and spire global which be lead provider of space base data analytic and space service this year be glasgow birthday the bill will help secure the prosperity of glasgow for the next year create job and economic growth in my great city of hard work innovation and enterprise there be clear economic analysis that show that the space industry be an important opportunity area for growth and job the late size and health of the uk space industry report estimate that organisation in scotland generate combined income of million in almost double that of in real term about people work in space in scotland and the figure for the uk be between and income amount to between billion and billion there be more than job in the supply chain as well let we pause for moment on that we have only just get go on this and we have or more job there be much potential here for many more good high pay job of the future which be what britain need
