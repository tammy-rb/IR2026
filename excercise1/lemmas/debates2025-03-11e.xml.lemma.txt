oral answers to questions justice the secretary of state be ask criminal justice system efficiency technology what step her department be take to use technology to improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system this government inherit an analogue justice system that have not keep pace with digital world technology can and must transform the justice system since take office we have expand the use of tagging we be pilot new technology to automate manual work in the justice system and have launch new unit justice ai to far develop the use of artificial intelligence the recent announcement of sit day be welcome but we need to use technology to streamline our justice system between and we see reduction in case be conclude what plan do the government have to use emerge new tech to enhance court processing get fast justice for victim and help manage offender in the community include through ankle tag to enforce exclusion zone and drug and alcohol testing my hon friend raise an incredibly important point we need to make sure that the whole justice system include what happen in our criminal court be as efficient as it can be that be why have commission sir brian leveson to conduct an independent review of the criminal court he will consider how to improve the court efficiency and we will report on that later in the year there will be believe wide role for technology to play in tagging and monitoring of exclusion zone and curfew want to make sure that the justice system be in the good possible position to make use of emerge technology so that we can keep our country safe the lord chancellor will accept that the effective use of electronic tag will not only make the criminal justice system more efficient but mitigate the need for expensive prison place do she agree that two thing be necessary for that effective use first the tag must be technically reliable secondly official in her department must have the commercial capacity to manage the contract efficiently if she agree what can be do to improve both those thing the right hon and learn gentleman raise two incredibly important point there will be big role for current new and emerge technology in the future of our justice system particularly in expand the range of punishment available to we outside of prison want to make sure that we be at the forefront of get the good use of our current technology and emerge tech he be absolutely right about make sure that any commercial contract be value for money and maintain public confidence be ensure that across the department we have expertise available to we which be why the new unit that have set up justice ai will be so crucial to our effort call the shadow secretary of state under the justice secretary leadership her department let out dozen of dangerous prisoner by mistake last year now we have uncover that criminal who be let out early by her department be not monitor for up to eight week as they be not fit with electronic tag it be another glaring error will the justice secretary clear up some confusion how many criminal do her department fail to tag be any offence commit while these criminal go unmonitored and who have be hold accountable for this gross incompetence be really concerned for the health of the shadow justice secretary because he appear to have amnesia he have forget who be in government just few short month ago he appear to have entirely forget that it be the previous government who let the tagging contract to serco which have inherit have make it clear that the delay that we have see be totally unacceptable although the backlog have be significantly reduce serco performance be still not good enough and although last year backlog of outstanding visit have be substantially reduce it be down to normal level will continue to hold it to account and will not hesitate to impose further financial penalty where necessary we can all see that the justice secretary have no answer to my question if her department can not even tag prisoner properly why should the public have any confidence in her plan to use tag in place of short prison sentence the threshold for prison sentence be already high often criminal have commit multiple offence before they be first consider for prison which be why scrap short sentence will endanger the public and will serve as green light for criminality will the justice secretary take this opportunity to reassure the public and rule out reduce sentence for burglary theft or shoplifting it be simple question yes or no the public will know that when the right hon gentleman government leave office prison be on the point of collapse they can have confidence that this government will fix the mess that his party leave behind we will ensure that prison place be always available for everyone who need to be lock up to keep the public safe we will expand the range of punishment outside prison and crucially we will ensure that those who enter the prison system can be help to turn their back on crime that be the good strategy for cut crime and one that his party never choose justice estate springhill road whether she plan to release land own by her department at springhill road to the springhill road residents association as the hon member will know from his meeting with the minster for prisons in the other place currently there be no plan to release land at springhill road the ministry of justice be work closely with local representative to ensure that we bring benefit to the local community as part of the new prison build be grateful for the minister answer and for the prisons minister time last summer notwithstanding our local opposition to new prison it be an absurdity that have be go on for year that the moj own the green the lamppost and the public lighting on the springhill road estate adjacent to hmp spring hill even though they be of no use to the moj and there be no benefit to the prison estate the resident association be willing to take those green and care for they so that kid can play on they and resident can use they will the minister look again at get the land transfer because it be of no benefit to he or his department under the last government only prison place be create by contrast the last labour government deliver the lord chancellor have set out her ambition to deliver new place by almost of those will be provide by the new prison in the hon gentleman constituency if he write to about the specific concern of the resident association will be happy to respond defendant absconding before trial what step she be take through the criminal justice system to help prevent defendant abscond before their trial the decision to remand or bail an individual be solely matter for the independent judiciary court be require to considered the likelihood of absconding as part of that decision the court have the power to impose broad range of robust bail condition in the bail package include electronic monitoring exclusion zone and curfew this government be commit to ensure that criminal face justice and victim have peace of mind and closure after the conviction of eight man for string of horrendous child rape in my constituency would like to be able to inform the secretary of state that all those man be now serve their just punishment however two of they abscond from their trial and be believe to be abroad their exact whereabouts be an open secret in keighley it be shocking failure of the justice system that those man be still walk free do the minister agree that if dual or foreign national be charge with disgusting child rape crime court should be require to put term on their bail that prevent they from leave the country during their trial so that they can not walk free after their horrendous heinous crime understand that the case to which the hon gentleman refer take place under the last government and the man he refer to be try in absentia the home secretary set out the step that the government be take to tackle the terrible crime of child sexual exploitation and abuse include group base child sexual exploitation through the crime and policing bill we be legislate to make groom an aggravate factor in the sentencing of child sexual offence to ensure that it be properly reflect in the sentencing of perpetrator court transcript costs what step she be take to reduce the cost of court transcript for victim the government recognise just how important accessing transcript can be for certain victim that be why transcript of sentencing remark be available free of charge to the family of victim of fatal road offence murder and manslaughter it be also why this government be run one year pilot that offer free sentencing remark to victim of rape and sexual offence that be due to conclude in may we be also look in the round at how we lower the cost of obtain court transcript through increase use of technology the previous government launch pilot scheme to provide free sentencing remark to victim of sexual violence however thousand of eligible survivor only find out about it month after it start poor communication mean that victim miss out on the opportunity for some closure will the justice secretary confirm whether the pilot have be properly evaluate whether its finding will be make public and what step will be take to improve awareness and accessibility for those who need to use the scheme the hon member be absolutely right that initially there be not enough uptake the government act to drum up awareness of the scheme precisely because we want to test its effectiveness for victim of rape and serious sexual offence reassure she that application number be up we be conduct the evaluation and once we have the result we will be able to test whether we can implement the scheme in the future knife crime victim what step her department be take to help support victim of knife crime through the criminal justice system the ministry of justice provide funding for victim support service to help victim recover from the impact of crime include knife crime the government have commit to the creation of new programme young futures which will offer support to child who be at risk of be draw into crime in more systemic way do the minister agree that the support she have outline for the victim of knife crime will continue

will include strict rule for online retailer sell knife welcome the step that the government be take to address knife crime and anything that can be do to reduce the number of young people who be draw into this type of violence how will the new offence of possess knife with violent intent differ from exist legislation relate to possession of an article with blade or point or possession of an offensive weapon how far will the law go when it come to prove intent will it refer only to the posture of the individual when arrest for example they may have be catch in the act of machete style fight or will it have regard to other factor such as someone appear in scoreboard video on social medium welcome that question my understanding be that the hon member be member of the crime and policing bill committee that will be scrutinise the legislation indicate dissent be he not will welcome engagement with he though and his scrutiny as the legislation progress through the house the government be increase penalty for illegal sale of knife and be fund new online police co ordination hub which will take action against illegal knife and weapon content online we also intend to

scheme to know when their abuser be be release from prison or move to an open prison and to have input into the kind of condition that should exist when they be release however the system that we have inherit from the last government be such that only survivor whose abuser have be convict for more than month qualify for the scheme in the upcoming victims courts and public protection bill will the minister commit to scrap that threshold so that all victim and survivor can qualify for the scheme we be look carefully at the victim notification scheme as part of any forthcoming legislation to ensure that victim right be take into full consideration and that victim be aware of the situation if that be deem appropriate look forward to work with they closely and have no doubt about how we should develop the good and strong possible law to support the victim of all crime in our country prison leavers resettlement if she will make an assessment of the potential merit of ensure that all

evidence of what victim want the sentencing review interim report describe the situation at the moment and it be the first stage of that independent review address this long stand issue frankly this be something that the conservatives spend the last year avoid tackle that will leave it there the house will have hear very starkly that the minister do not offer any clarity can help he by tell he that there be not one word anywhere on the expectation of victim of crime and their not one word bad than that it cherry pick evidence from report to support narrative that an ill inform public do not know what they want and do not understand do the minister agree that for that review to have any credibility whatsoever it must engage seriously with what victim and the public want when it come to the use of prison for the punishment of serious offender we hear fully the commitment from the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones and the lord chancellor that victim be front and centre of our approach to fix the mess that the conservatives leave we there be victim representative on the panel as the hon member well know victim be fully involve and engage in this have sadly meet too many victim in this role and have encourage all of they to contribute to the report and commit to they that they will be fully involve in the

violence charge against their abuser violence against woman and girl be national scandal and femicide be ongoing with countless woman lose their life to male violence sadly my region of merseyside be now the second high region in the country for femicide do the department agree that any move to fast track case via the criminal or civil court to remove abuser from our street must involve appropriately severe sentence irrespective of the prison place crisis thank my hon friend for that important and timely question we take all form of homicide extremely seriously and our strategy which will be publish later this week look at tackle violence against woman and girl will cover all form of violence and abuse that disproportionately impact woman include femicide we will of course

we can to support woman and their child we have declare this national emergency and we have that ambition of target and halve violence against woman and girl over the course of decade my personal ambition be that the name read out at this dispatch box next year be far few than the one read out this year prison illegal drug use what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of trend in the level of illegal drug use in prison this government inherit prison in crisis overcrowded violent and rife with drug if we be to have regime that reduce reoffende and cut crime we have to crack down on drug in prison to do so we must address the supply of drug and prison use range of tactic include ray body scanner and baggage scanner we must also tackle demand over of our prison now have drug free wing before less than of seize substance contain anabolic steroid in it be with anabolic steroid be the third most prevalent drug class detect in scottish prison will the lord chancellor meet and dr jayasena and dr grant who be national lead on the topic from imperial college to look at conduct research into the impact of steroid on offend and the prison population pay

compassion focus therapy group design for woman independent sentencing review interim report what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of the independent sentencing review interim report publish on february will not pre empt the final report of the sentencing review but let we remember the crisis that we be deal with the previous government ramp up sentence but add just cell throughout the entire time they be in office just today we have hear example of member who do not want any prison building in their area this government will build new prison place but even that will not be enough to get we out of the mess leave by the previous administration that be why have ask the independent sentencing review to recommend sentencing policy that will ensure that we never again run out of space the government will consider alternative to prison and early release but how be the public to have any confidence whatsoever when the government release prisoner early and leave they to roam the street for eight week before fix tag as say in answer to an early question we be hold serco to account and we ensure that the tagging backlog from the change to standard determinate sentence be clear as quickly as possible we have levy financial penalty against that company we continue to monitor performance and will not hesitate to take further action if we need to conservative members have to wake up to the reality of their own track record in government they fail to build the prison place that we need to keep up with the sentence that they keep impose which have leave we with an almighty mess to clear up we be get on with the job call the liberal democrat spokesperson the independent sentencing review and the justice secretary have be take inspiration from texas when it come to reform our criminal justice system she might be aware that texas have dedicated set of domestic abuse aggravate offence to help protect and respect survivor will she support and liberal democrat colleague in introduce proposal to the crime and policing bill in order to make similar change to the law in england and wales have not yet see the hon gentleman proposal which may be on their way but will look at they carefully he will know that the picture be complex even jurisdiction with catch all domestic abuse offence face issue ensure that it keep up with the type of behaviour that they be try to stamp out and that other offence do not fall off so there be technical issue in how such law work in practice would be happy to have further such conversation with he know this matter be of great interest to he and to members across the house intimate image abuse what step her department be take to help tackle intimate image abuse we be determined to keep victim safe both offline and online in the crime and policing bill we have introduce offence to tackle the taking or recording of intimate image without consent and in the data use and access bill we be criminalise create or ask someone to create deepfake intimate image without consent together with exist offence on share intimate image those measure give law enforcement comprehensive package to tackle all aspect of that degrading and abusive behaviour pay tribute to the minister for the work be do although that work be welcome we need to direct our attention towards ensure that police have the necessary technical tool to investigate report will she meet to discuss what further action can be take to address and prevent intimate image abuse in all our community will happily meet my hon friend but let reassure he we be launch within police our national centre for violence against woman and girl and public protection that include million funding settlement to target violence against woman and girl well include online and in november we launch our domestic abuse protection order in select area to improve protection for victim of all kind of domestic abuse include online the police be also able to use stalk protection order to protect victim of online abuse prison capacity what step her department be take to increase prison capacity this government inherit prison system on the verge of collapse under the last government in year only prison place be produce under the last labour government there be net increase of prison place in year we be redouble our effort to match that number the prison capacity crisis that this government inherit have result in persistent offender not feel the deterrent effect of custody option be realistically available can the minister tell we how this government prison building plan will restore level of deterrence to the system and ensure that capacity be available in time to remove active offender from the street where they be block we be build build building hmp millsike the uk first all electric prison will open in just few week and deliver place just last week the prisons minister in the other place attend groundbreaking at hmp highpoint and we have already secure full planning permission for new prison in leicestershire and outline planning permission for new prison in buckinghamshire we be get on with the job the minister will know that the increase in prisoner number be often because of the logjam within the crown court system and there be too many on remand who be then convict and release with time serve with no opportunity for rehabilitation or mentoring will he confirm that that form part of the sentencing review or the leveson review that be why we be do this big system relook the right hon member be right to draw attention to this we be go to tackle it and sort it out prison urgent notifications what support she have provide to prison that have receive an urgent notification since july thank the hon member for draw attention to the terrible legacy we inherit from the previous government the prisons minister in the other place have personally visit three of the prison that have recently receive urgent notification wandsworth winchester and manchester and plan to visit the fourth as soon as possible he have strengthen the un process and meet regularly with governor and senior official to challenge they and assure himself that sufficient progress be be make thank the minister for that answer prison officer do an important job and thank every officer at downview prison in banstead it be extremely concern that the number of assault on staff at downview more than double between and what step be he take to ensure that officer be protect in their day to day job as the hon member rightly say prison officer do an outstanding job the work of the prison service be to make sure they be properly support and protect in that role and that be what be go on court backlogs what step she be take to tackle backlog in the court the last government leave mess in every single corner of our justice system our criminal court and our civil court in the process they let down not just victim of crime but business employee employer and child in care every part of our system be leave in complete mess that be what we be sort out with record crown court sitting day commitment of sit day and run almost to maximum across all jurisdiction to bring down the backlog we be sort out the mess that we be leave with agree with the minister assessment of the previous conservative government however with more than case still in the backlog for magistrate have the government do an assessment of whether that will increase give the double sentencing power that have be pass down to those court the magistrate court be be run in sustainable way we extend the sentencing power in order to free up capacity in the crown court and that have be sustainable and we be increase capacity in our magistracy by recruit an additional magistrate from diverse background every year but that be why we be look at system reform whether in the magistrate court or the crown court we be go to need once in generation reform and when sir brian leveson report back that be what we will get shockingly just of rape and sexual offence report to derbyshire police in the last year result in charge when offender be not prosecute victim understandably lose faith in our justice system what step have the minister take to reduce backlog in derbyshire court so that justice can be serve for these despicable crime be sorry to hear how long victim in my hon friend constituency be wait that be why we be take urgent action to bear down on the crown court backlog not only by increase sitting day this year but by commit to record number of sit day next year of course that will not be sufficient to bring down the backlog and deliver swifter justice for victim and that be why we need to hear from sir brian leveson and implement reform in due course crown court backlog what step her department be take to reduce the crown court backlog this government be fund record crown court sitting day which be more than the previous government fund to bring down the backlog we must embrace reform and that be why have launch an independent review into the efficiency of the criminal court lead by sir brian leveson this government will deliver swifter justice for victim in case be dispose of conclude in the crown court that figure be never achieve again by the conservative party and by the figure be low conservative member like to blame covid for everything but there be problem in the system well before that there have be systematic failure to modernise process in our court for year as we on the justice committee hear far too often what more can we do to use technology to make our court more efficient and most importantly ensure fast outcome for victim my hon friend be right to note the issue of fall disposal in layman term the number of case that be complete the rate of disposal have indeed fall in recent year which why have ask sir brian leveson as part of his review to consider how we improve the efficiency of our court include further technical or ai relate reform that might assist case to move more quickly through the system we will need three pronged approach more funding which have already deliver once in generation reform which sir brian leveson be look at and go far and fast on productivity and efficiency in the system that be how we will get swifter justice for victim the backlog in our criminal justice system mean that offender in my constituency be free to commit crime while wait for the judicial process meet sussex police and resident last week and hear how the backlog be make the already hard job of the police even hard and resident live misery how do the secretary of state plan on tackle those backlog which be lead to offender roam free and more crime be commit we be already tackle those issue and as soon come into office increase the number of sit day by on what inherit from the previous administration have increase the sentencing power of magistrate court and increase funding for legal aid criminal legal aid underpin the whole system and for the next financial year we be fund record crown court sitting day that combine with once in generation reform of the court to deal with the demand come into the system and go far on productivity and efficiency be how we will deal with the problem that the hon member rightly note topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility the government inherit prison on the point of collapse and record and rise backlog in our court eight month into office the work of restore justice in this country be well under way since the last justice question have announce record investment in our court and next year crown court will sit for up to day which be the high allocation in record history have also announce vital reform to the probation service increase its focus on medium and high risk offender alongside recruit new probation officer also visit texas where tough and smart approach have reduce reoffende cut crime to its low level in the us since the and bring its prison population under control there be much that we will learn from that law and order state particularly how we get offender to turn their back on life of crime through our plan for change the government be deliver swifter justice use punishment to cut crime and make our street safe on average more than people every week across the uk die from drug relate cause that be more than family and home devaste each year by that tragic loss of life include more than in northern ireland alone will the secretary of state commit to work with each of the devolved administrations to prioritise prevention and review enforcement against the use of all illegal substance the hon gentleman make an incredibly important point fix the problem that he note require work by not just the ministry of justice but the devolve administrations and the home office will ensure that he can engage with the relevant ministers on the issue he raise last year assault on prison staff be up by and serious assault be up by yet the pensionable age of prison officer be still it be simply too late can the minister update the house on any discussion he may have have with official regard that industrial injustice and say when these loyal public servant might expect to see this long stand issue correct we recognise the unique and challenging role that prison officer play in protect the public and reduce reoffende the lord chancellor have request advice from official on the pension age of prison officer and we will continue to engage with trade union as we work through this complex issue while consider the wide fiscal context be meet the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan to discuss this important issue next week and be very happy for my hon friend to join that meeting if he wish call the shadow secretary of state yesterday the sentencing council issue letter correct the justice secretary it make it clear that the new sentencing guideline be not the same as the draft guidance under the last government and explain that her department support the new two tier guidance her representative be at the meeting and it be approve on january her official be even give walkthrough on march dummy guide to two tier justice after bring that to her attention last wednesday her team brief the paper that she be incandescent be she incandescent at her official or at her own failure to read her paper and do her job properly the shadow lord chancellor amnesia continue because he clearly have not do his homework he have forget that his government be consult extensively on this guidance it also appear that he can not read because the letter state very clearly all the consultation that take place under his government it show that they be consult numerous time on the new guidance and welcome it notice that he do not refer to that he know full well that the change he refer to be minor change because the reference to race ethnicity and cultural background have be retain in the time his government see it and the change that occur so he can not hide behind that the last few day have therefore be an expert lesson from the right hon gentleman he have teach we all how to throw the shadow transport secretary under bus as lawyer herself would have think that the justice secretary would know the difference between the last set of guidance and the new one say as lawyer but in this cabinet we never really know who be real lawyer and who be just pretend to be one in day time by the justice secretary own admission we will have two tier justice her plan to fix that will not come into effect for year and that be unacceptable as she have be too lazy to do her job will do it for she today be present bill to block these two tier sentencing guideline and fix her mess it be here and ready to go will she support it will she stand with we on the conservative benches for equality under the law or will it be two tier justice with she and two tier keir the whole house can see that the only pretence at job be the one that the shadow lord chancellor be make because he be pretend to be the leader of the opposition we all know exactly what he be about my reaction to what have happen in relation to the sentencing council guideline be very clear when make the oral statement last week in this house we will never stand for two tier approach to sentencing be actually get on with fix the problem rather than look for bandwagon to jump on which be why have already write to the sentencing council will be meet it later this week and have make it very clear that will consider its role and its power if need to legislate will do so but will ensure that whatever change bring forward be workable and deliver the fair justice system that we all need and deserve one that his government do not deliver the principle of equality before the law be integral to our justice system but the new guideline from the sentencing council which be welcome by the previous government have put that principle at risk do the lord chancellor agree that conservative members have lot of explain to do notice that in all his reference to letter the shadow lord chancellor do not refer to the letter from the previous sentencing minister now the shadow transport secretary who welcome those guideline he know full well that that be reference to the guideline around race ethnicity and cultural background the government statistic on woman in the criminal justice system show that woman be more often prosecute for much more minor offence and suffer from short prison sentence which have huge social and emotional effect on their child and increase their likelihood of be take into care what step be the department take to continue deliver the female offender strategy delivery plan for to and to reach beyond it think about the negative impact on the child of offender the hon lady raise an important point that be why set up the women justice board specifically to make recommendation believe that these be policy choice that be properly make by directly elect politician we will make progress on the situation of woman in our prison particularly those who be mother because we know that the harm pass down generation and we be determined to stop it victim of rape have be consistently fail by our justice system under the tories of victim drop out of their case due to long waiting time and in my own area of bournemouth the charge rate be only give the outrage we have hear from conservative members about the court backlog and the state of our system which be leave to we by their own government can the lord chancellor please tell we what we be do to fix the problem and put victim first thank my hon friend for that very important question as part of our manifesto we commit to fast track rape case through the system we be carefully consider the good way to do so and we will be able to say more about our plan shortly we be also create independent legal adviser for adult rape victim who will be able to access that support at any point from report to trial so that they know their right and their right be protect the government say that foreign national offender make up of the prison population can the secretary of state tell when that number will be zero what can tell the hon gentleman be that this government have make fast progress than the previous government on the deportation of foreign national offender from our prison with number that be over high than the same time last year and we will keep move forward constituent of mine age just tragically die after access pro suicide online forum that not only encourage self harm but advertise how to get lethal drug and how to exploit loophole that allow this the substance use in her death can still be buy on amazon today what step will the minister take to close those loophole for those who enable criminality and ensure that the law be actively keep our young people safe be sorry to hear about that tragic case in my hon friend constituency encourage or assist suicide be an offence under the suicide act and send communication that encourage or assist serious self harm be an offence under the online safety act but we be go to tighten up the law to address the situation that my hon friend have describe of course this be about not just the law but the enforcement of the law as well we all agree that the court backlog must be clear as justice for victim be essential however be the government heed the law society advice to not waste precious time and resource on an intermediate court and what engagement have they have with the law society on that as the lord chancellor have say our priority be deliver swifter justice for victim and bear down on the crown court backlog that be why we have ask sir brian leveson to consider all option which have to include reclassification of offence and the intermediate court we have to have whole system reform but fear that if we be to exclude those option we would not be grip the problem significant proportion of those who experience homelessness be ex offender have previously raise concern that the drive to alleviate the prison place crisis must not add to the homelessness emergency the deputy prime minister be in the process of establish an inter ministerial group on tackle homelessness will my right hon friend department play full and active role in that inter ministerial group and ensure that ministers and official from the ministry of justice be adequately represent my hon friend make very good point and the ministry of justice will play full part in the inter ministerial group welcome the secretary of state attempt to prevent the sentencing council from change the sentencing process which would lead to two tier justice system if however the council will not budge as appear to be the case two tier justice system will arrive in just day contradict the key principle of the legal system that everyone should be equal before the law without discrimination will the secretary of state introduce legislation immediately to ensure that that two tier justice system do not come about have already set out exactly what be go to do have write to the sentencing council use the power that have to do so and will be meet it later this week have make it very clear that will consider its role and power and if need to legislate will not hesitate to do so one of my constituent have endure prolong financial abuse due to draw out divorce financial order proceeding which largely ignore domestic abuse except in rare case will the minister commit to review financial settlement proceeding guidance to ensure that the impact of domestic abuse be properly consider and to prevent the legal system from be use as tool of continue coercion and control thank my hon friend for his important question and my thought be with his constituent as she navigate this difficulty the government will consider carefully the report on financial provision on divorce in which the law commission look into the specific issue of domestic abuse as factor later this year the government will consult on the delivery of our manifesto commitment to strengthen the right and protection of cohabit couple because all abuse be abuse financial or otherwise when someone enter this country illegally from another country to which we be not allow to deport they and when they have previously express support for terrorism and terrorist organisation but not in this jurisdiction be the secretary of state content that the government have enough power to protect the community from such person walk free in our society the right hon gentleman raise an incredibly important point be discuss with the home secretary the full range of power that we need to have at our disposal and she have already make it clear that we will not hesitate to act far if we need to however it be important that we be able to deport offender who pose risk to our country last week at justice committee hearing it be confirm that an effective probation service be essential to the rehabilitation of offender and to prevent reoffende however over the year the service have be under immense strain owe to increase demand what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that probation officer have manageable caseload and that support be provide for their mental health and wellbee to avoid high level of stress and burnout and also to help with the recruitment and retention of staff let take this opportunity to pay tribute to the probation service my hon friend be right to draw attention to the chaotic running of the service under the last government we be actively monitor the effectiveness of the probation reset policy and assess its impact on workload capacity the time save and the increase focus on individual pose the high risk to public safety we recognise the significant pressure that probation officer have be under which be why comprehensive wellbeing support model have be put in place across our service include dedicated wellbeing lead for both prison and probation service what work be the secretary of state do with the victims commissioner to ensure that the family of british citizen who be murder abroad have the same right as the family of homicide victim in the united kingdom regularly meet both the victims commissioner for england and wales and the london victims commissioner to consider all issue affect victim and their family we be strengthen the power of the victims commissioner through legislation we will be strengthen the victim code and we will of course consider any other measure that be need to protect victim and their family wherever they may be on several occasion have meet my constituent beverley whose son suffer horrific murder he be stab more than time she have be desperately attempt to get hold of the court transcript but to no avail will minister please meet to help this still grieve mum be really horrified to hear of that case of course as mention early the transcript of sentencing remark should have be make available free of charge but be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss how transcript of trial more broadly can be make available on radio today programme last week matthew ryder kc who sit as judge praise the extreme helpfulness of pre sentence report for pass effective sentence will the secretary of state do as he ask and endorse the importance value and independence of the sentencing council we all agree across the house hope that pre sentencing report play vital role in ensure that whoever be pass sentence have all the relevant fact at their disposal do not believe that access to such report or whether sentencer ask for they should be dictate by race or ethnic background they should be make available and would like to see more use of pre sentence report across the board for every type of offender manchester metropolitan university estimate that over people be convict under joint enterprise each year cost the taxpayer billion do the minister agree that we need to amend the law on joint enterprise to free up space in our prison the law on joint enterprise have already develop somewhat since the previous court of appeal decision know that the director of public prosecutions be keep under review how prosecute decision be make at this point we have no plan to go far but be happy to ensure that my hon friend can meet the relevant minister across the united kingdom inquest be define as be for the purpose of find out who the decease be and how when and where they die they be not trial and they be not about assign blame even when they be extend into article investigation yet in northern ireland we have have finding of blame in respect of sas soldier kill active terrorist do the minister agree that the crime and policing bill afford an opportunity through suitable amendment to bring uniformity to the operation of inquest across the united kingdom the hon and learn gentleman be right to confirm that an inquest should be an inquisitorial process it should not be adversarial either will raise the issue that he have mention with the secretary of state for northern ireland but what be deem to be in scope of legislation be matter for the house authority and the leader of the house prison maintenance privatisation have be complete and utter disaster when will it be take back in house we be invest approximately million over two year in prison and probation service maintenance to improve condition across our estate but it be fair to say we have inherit system in serious need of repair the estimate cost of bring the prison estate to fair condition and maintain it till the end of the decade be billion the programme be now under way and we hope that we will make as much progress as possible rise if member keep stand it make it easy for one of the key objective of the sentencing council be to ensure that there be parity of sentence up and down the country it be know fact that people from ethnic minority sometimes get tough custodial sentence than their white counterpart for similar offence give that do the lord chancellor regret her attempt to discredit the consider and evidence base conclusion of some of the most esteemed member of our judiciary when they publish the guideline on pre sentencing report what be shocked about be that we can see disparity in the overall cohort sentence outcome everybody accept that we be not quite sure why it be happen and there have not be sufficient curiosity over the last few year to work out why that be the case my view be that if we can see problem or think we have one we need to get to the bottom of what be actually go on before we start come up with broad policy solution to fix that problem also think that some of these broad policy decision be well make by ministers because we be directly elect individual who will pay the price for the consequence of our choice that be conversation that will pick up with the sentencing council when we meet later this week in lorraine cox be brutally murder in exeter her murderer dismember her body and as result her family have never be able to fully lay lorraine to rest her father tony cox have be campaign for the implementation of helen law mean that desecrate or conceal body would become separate criminal offence will the minister meet to discuss whether the implementation of helen law be possible will happily meet my hon friend to discuss that far what be this government do to crack down on unqualified people represent themselves as solicitor as the hon member well know the solicitor profession be highly regulated we have the solicitors regulation authority which itself be regulate by the legal services board all our professional whether they be practise in criminal or civil law be highly respected and highly regulated and we be indebted to they be shocked to read the sentencing council response to the secretary of state last night with its arrogant tone as she have say this parliament be sovereign and the fact be that we have give too much power away to these unelected body in recent year can reassure she of my support and can she reassure that she will not rest until we retain equality before the law thank my hon friend be very much look forward to my meeting with the sentencing council later this week as have make clear be look into the role and power of the council and will not hesitate to legislate if need to do so the two tier sentencing guideline take effect on april if the lord chancellor be sincere about have justice system that treat everyone equally will she not support our bill to block the guideline have already make my position clear have write to the sentencing council and will be meet it later this

extinguish but the solong continue to burn although they become attach to each other during the collision the solong break free of the stena immaculate late last night and begin drift southward modelling suggest that should the solong remain afloat it will remain clear of land for the next few hour the assessment of hm coastguard be however that it be unlikely the vessel will remain afloat tugboat be in the vicinity to ensure that the solong remain away from the coast and to respond as the situation develop want to be clear that while metre temporary exclusion zone have be establish around both vessel maritime traffic through the humber estuary be continue the full crew of on the mv stena immaculate be account for and on shore one sailor be treat at the scene but decline any further medical assistance thirteen of the sailor of the mv solong be account for search and rescue operation for the miss sailor continue throughout yesterday but be call off yesterday evening at the point at which the chance of their survival have unfortunately significantly diminish our working assumption be very sadly that the sailor be deceased the coastguard have inform the company and it have be advise to inform the next of kin our thought be with the sailor love one at this time regard the cargo on the vessel the mv stena be carry barrel of jet fuel which be the source of the fire the maritime and coastguard agency be work at pace to determine exactly what cargo the solong be carry be aware of medium report about potential hazardous material on board but we be unable to confirm that at this time however counter pollution measure and asset be already in place and both vessel be be closely monitor for structural integrity tactical co ordination group have be establish through the humber and lincolnshire local resilience forum the marine accident investigation branch have deploy to the site and begin its investigation the mca be rapidly develop plan to salvage the vessel

statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of his statement yesterday morning shortly before am the container ship mv solong collide with the oil tanker mv stena immaculate which be at anchor in the north sea off the coast of yorkshire the stena immaculate be on short term charter to the us navy military sealift command and be carry barrel of jet fuel the minister have not formally confirm the cargo of the solong madeira flagged vessel but it have be widely report that it be carry container of toxic sodium cyanide listen to the statement carefully but can the minister confirm that that be now not his understanding the collision and the result spill be deeply concern however before question the minister on the government response join he in pay tribute to hm coastguard the royal national lifeboat institution the emergency service and all other who help to respond to the incident as the minister note the emergency service be on the scene swiftly and their action save many life approach fiercely burn vessel with risk of explosion take enormous bravery and we all commend they be grateful for the confirmation that all mariner from the stena immaculate have be recover without injury and that of the crew member from the solong have be bring safely ashore our thought and prayer be with the family and colleague of the miss member of that crew understand that the search for life have conclude but can the minister update the house on the effort be make to recover that mariner turn to the collision itself the minister confirm that early investigation do not point to foul play but will he commit to remain vigilant to ensure that any indication of foul play be carefully investigate additionally will he inform the house of the impact on the investigative process of the involvement of ship register in both the us and madeira have the government contact the respective government to ensure their close co operation the minister will be aware of the deep concern over the effect of the oil spill on the surround marine environment environmental organisation have warn of potentially devastating impact of pollution from the tanker on the habitat and specie in the area include threatened seabird colony grey seal and fish and nature rich site such as the humber estuary where conservationist have be restore seagrass and oyster could be devastate by this emergency have he be brief by the environment agency on its response and could he give we more detail on it the minister make reference to the drift of the solong and the risk of it run aground without intervention can he update the house on the step that will be take to ensure that that do not happen understand that the marine accident investigation branch have begin preliminary investigation into the emergency and be pleased that the minister be work closely with the maritime and coastguard agency as it conduct an assessment on the counter pollution response that may be require over the come day however seek assurance that the government will engage closely with local community who will be concern about the impact of the collision on their environment the incident involve multiple departments span emergency response environmental protection maritime safety defence and chemical transport regulation and effective cross government co ordination be therefore crucial will the minister assure the house that such co ordination be take place and that parliament will receive regular update it be of course too early to draw significant conclusion at this stage but it be clear that something go terribly wrong in the handling of these two vessel we will support the minister in whatever action be need to ensure the high standard of safety on the high sea the shadow minister be exactly right something do go terribly wrong my thought and prayer be with the miss sailor family the company have be inform and his next of kin be be inform in response to the series of question the shadow minister ask we know for sure that the immaculate be carry barrel of jet fuel but we be yet to establish the cargo of the solong as soon as know will make that information available to the house we will do everything to recover the body of the mariner in recent debate on emergency response service we hear that though life be lose at sea some succour and comfort be give by the rescue service who often bring people love one back to they for proper funeral and burial whether there be foul play be think speculation there be no evidence to suggest that at the moment through the mca we be in contact with our american and portuguese counterpart and have liaise with they on the counter pollution measure that the shadow minister mention the mca be stand by with marine and aerial counter pollution measure which it will use at the necessary time however the immediate concern be to put out the fire on the solong the shadow minister mention the issue of drift the immaculate remain anchored so we be safe there it be the solong that be drift at nautical mile per hour it be currently be shadow by two tugboat and the order will be give by sosrep or the mca to intervene as and when necessary to protect life onshore the shadow minister be right about the marine accident investigation branch we have deploy those asset to the scene they be currently work with the local resilience forum and want to pass on my thank to the humberside resilience forum at this time can assure he that government agency be work together effectively and have

minister confirm how route be be manage while the solong be drift and whether further protection of route will be need because of pollution in order not to delay further movement of ship in these busy water and to protect the welfare of seafarer in other ship thank the chair of the transport committee for that question it be an incredibly busy sea highway as we all know have the great honour of visit the command and control post of the humber estuary on what be almost my last visit as shadow maritime minister just before the general election and pay tribute to the worker there for their hard work in deal with this situation want to assure the chair of the transport committee that the immaculate be anchor it be the solong that be drift there be metre exclusion zone around both vessel other

of his statement the scene we have all witness in news report be very concerning and our thought be with all those affected and with the family of the crew member who remain unaccounted for this event remind we of the risk and danger face by those who work in the maritime sector these man and woman often work long challenge hour keep our country and economy go with little if any recognition and we be hugely grateful to they we be also indebted to the emergency service the royal national lifeboat institution and the coastguard for their tireless work through the night know they be do all they can to limit the damage and the environmental impact and have do so much to minimise the loss of life while it will take time to establish what have take place it be clear that the government need to take urgent step to limit the damage and reassure local community welcome the government formation of the tactical co ordination group and the work it be do with other agency appreciate that the situation be still unfold and that many question can not be answer at this stage however will the minister say first what immediate step the government be take to protect the environment along the east coast secondly what be he do to keep shipping route open and safe thirdly what be the government plan to support fishing and other business that rely on water that might now be contaminate join

with marine and aerial counter pollution measure in place once we get the fire on the solong out we will begin to assess the situation and deploy they it be vital that we keep ship lane in the humber

circumstance thank the minister for his communication with through this unfold situation and everybody who have be involve in it the situation be evolve minute by minute and pay tribute to the local

coast in my constituency apart from brief phone call follow my reach out to the secretary of state for transport speak to the leader of east riding of yorkshire council the police and crime commissioner and local councillor all be struggle to get information as to what be go on just mile off the coast my constituent from kilsney easington withernsea aldborough and beyond deserve well must ask the minister why it take so long for the local resilience forum to be set up be he confident that we have the proper structure of governance in place when disaster such as this happen how can we ensure that communication be improve what work be be do to protect the puffin wildlife and beach in our area and how can we ensure that the agency responsible be hold to account perhaps the minister can comment on why he be miss in action yesterday we would have love to have hear not just from hour rolling medium but from member of our own elect government about what be happen with this terrible disaster mr speaker be deal with the member hear hear the secretary of state make statement we stand up the maritime and coastguard agency and within minute response be ongoing the right hon member have call from member of staff of the secretary of state within an hour or two of the incident he be keep fully inform the local humberside resilience forum be establish we deploy asset for marine protection at the site be not sure what he be ask for but be very proud of our agency both local and national that have work at pace to get we to where we be currently welcome the minister timely statement and would like to associate myself with his praise for the swift response of the emergency service and the rnli volunteer over recent year fisherman along the east coast of yorkshire include scarborough and whitby have battle to keep go against the background of the effect of the crustacean die off they be naturally extremely concerned by report of jet fuel possibly leak into the sea do appreciate that this be fast move situation but can my hon friend tell the house more about the counter pollution measure that be in place and also how predict weather condition will affect the ongoing operation thank my hon friend for her question yes know that member on the north east coast from both side of this house have be worry over number of year about the crustacean die off there be concern that jet oil could well be leak into the sea but every resource be be deploy by the mca and other agency to assess the extent of the pollution and every resource will be deploy to clean up that pollution happen to be meet fisherman organisation later in the week for separate reason so hope to be able to update they with further information about their valuable trade at that time have be in communication with liberal democrat councillor in the east riding of yorkshire and also the liberal democrat administration in hull yesterday the leader of the council mike ross raise the call for rapid response from government and really push the minister to provide clarity on what exactly we should be see from tactical co ordination group and whether there be government commitment to cover any environmental or economic impact moreover what more support will we see down the line if there be long term consequence as result of the pollution it be standard procedure to bring on board local resilience forum in any situation such as this that have be do the forum be up and run be grateful to all elect member across the party and hard work councillor who will be involve in make sure that the good interest of the people of the humber region be protect we have currently deploy on site all the resource that be need to contain the fire and to assess the environmental damage of any spillage we will continue to make decision in conjunction with the local resilience forum through the day and believe for the rest of the week wish to add my voice to the call make by my hon friend the member for scarborough and whitby alison hume give the very perilous position of the teesside and north yorkshire marine ecosystem follow the environmental disaster we suffer in ask the minister to ensure that the response be not only around the humber estuary but that he review the environmental impact for the entire east coast as well as have say the mca counter pollution asset be be deploy at the scene the rnli search and rescue and aviation have all be on site although search and rescue have be stand down both vessel be also carry marine heavy fuel oil that be present pollution risk should either vessel sink or break apart thank the minister for his statement today and echo his comment about the miss sailor also add my thank to all those who have be involve in the rescue operation particularly those at the rnli station in bridlington my constituent be rightly concerned about the potential environmental and ecological impact not least because we have the big bird colony in mainland britain bempton and flamborough in bridlington have the large shellfish land port in the uk and we have around million visitor to the area every year enjoy the beach from bridlington down to hornsea have the minister yet have any assessment of the direction of any potential pollution and the role that current and wind direction will play in where that pollution might eventually end up the hon member be right to raise that have conversation late last night on that subject with the minister responsible for nature my hon friend the member for coventry east mary creagh the met office have tell we that theoretical model be use to plot potential movement of the smoke plume which be similar to the way that it forecast weather air quality monitoring can be do by onshore monitoring station such as the one at immingham which be close to the site the immediate concern be to stop the fire so that we can assess the pollution as soon as the fire be out inspector can move near or move in to assess the extent of the spill if there be spill and then we can begin to deploy the relevant resource to tackle that spill my constituency be on the north east coast probably about mile from this horrendous disaster can the minister say whether there have be an initial assessment on how it happen and where the pollution might move to be there potential threat to the coastline of the north east of england thank my hon friend for his question as have say the met office be model the wind situation at the moment we need to get the fire out on the solong once that be do we can make further assessment of what be require and in which direction any pollution if there be any be move and we will deploy our asset to tackle that when we know that for sure it be just over year now since the mv braer be ground off shetland but for we the memory be still very fresh we know exactly how those community on the east coast of england who be brace for what may be come will feel we might not know what happen but we can be pretty certain that at some time somewhere something of this sort be go to happen such be the nature of shipping and how it be regulate and own across the world in shetland we have be warn for year of the danger of tanker anchor right by our shoreline and of other enter area that be mark on the chart as to be avoid but it be next to impossible to get any agency to take ownership of that know that the minister be concerned about this so can we use this moment to take serious look at how we protect our coastal and island community thank the right hon gentleman for his expertise in this area he have raise with the issue of tanker moor off shetland and orkney understand that the collision regulation state that there have to be proper sight and sound lookout and all other method so something have go wrong as difficult as it be to say accident always provide an opportunity to see how we can do thing well hope that when the marine accident investigation branch come back with both its initial and its substantive finding which will come to my desk we can learn the lesson of this accident join other in praise the emergency service and also praise martyn boyers and his colleague from port of grimsby east who support the emergency service obviously the concern at the moment be extinguish the fire but there will be potential long term impact on the local community inasmuch as there will be pollution and the like on the beach will the minister and other departments work closely with the council and other agency to ensure that any support that be need will be available the hon member have the port of immingham in his constituency where the immaculate be wait to unload its cargo when berth come available can assure he that the mca be on stand by it have marine and aerial logistic in place to assess any potential pollution spill if there be one we will tackle it but as say the priority be to extinguish the fire on the solong thank the minister for his statement we congratulate everyone involve it be worth remember the voluntary nature of so many of the emergency service and the rnli the volunteer from the rnli skegness rush out of their home and business to man the lifeboat which be away for almost hour put themselves in harm way with extraordinary bravery we should never forget that the hon member should brace himself for what be about to say he act with honour this weekend relate to my circumstance with his former party member and be grateful to he he be exactly right our emergency service be second to none as be our volunteer who help his majesty coastguard and the rnli these man and woman risk their life brave the sea the wind the temperature and the fog to go and do what they could at the scene yesterday have nothing but the high praise for they my constituency have the norfolk coast area of outstanding natural beauty and other vital habitat include the wash as well as fishing fleet give the location of the collision there be local concern about the potential impact when will risk assessment be do on the potential risk of pollution down the east coast to norfolk what action be be take to contain it will the minister commit to keep the public informed mca asset be be deploy currently to assess and monitor any potential environmental impact of this accident the hon gentleman be right that the area be richly biodiverse the priority remain extinguish the fire on the solong so that we can properly evaluate the situation once we get that do we will use every resource possible to ascertain the extent of the pollution and to clear it up let put on record my thank and appreciation to the resilience team at north norfolk district council and its staff and the port of wells for its response and preparedness it be not instantly clear what area will be affect and with change wind and weather condition pollution can change course north norfolk be nautical mile away from the incident and be currently predict to be unaffected but we be keep close eye on what happen will the minister confirm that he will keep all mps along the north sea coastline update on development will he also confirm that if pollution be set to reach north norfolk my fishing community will get as much notice as possible they have well rehearse plan in place but they need good notice in order to deploy they the hon member make an important point about how interconnect our coastal community be when it come to this type of incident our official be monitor where the pollution be go we be look at wind direction be grateful for the fact that his local resilience team be stand up and be happy to keep all member inform of the ongoing situation when require automatic identification system and radar should mean that these sort of thing do not happen even in dense fog which be why many of we think initially that this could well be maritime type event or that malign state actor could be involve fortunately that appear not to be the case but the event have expose vulnerability and ship like the stena immaculate could be say to be sit duck what audit will the minister do of that vulnerability will he put in place what be practically necessary to prevent such occurrence the right hon gentleman ask very good question in addition to have maritime responsibility be the security minister for the department of transport we will learn any maritime security lesson from this incident in term of malign actor and we will implement any recommendation have the minister be in contact with the scottish government notably about the solong port of origin clearly it be in significant danger of sink and have container on board if any of those container break loose and get wash up on shore widespread and firm public information about the danger of approach any container will be vital give the hazardous substance in some of they responsibility for the maritime and coastguard agency be reserve to and it cover the united kingdom hope that that answer the hon gentleman first question on his second question do not want to speculate on the cargo of the solong until have the fact confirm by official and will then let the house know appropriately thank the minister for the clarity of his statement and his answer be it not extraordinary that there be such uncertainty about whether so deadly cargo as sodium cyanide be be carry on one of the vessel he say that tug might have to intervene to prevent the vessel run aground on the shore of this country have he consider that if the fire be too dangerous for the tug to approach then in those extreme circumstance the royal navy involvement might be necessary we be proud maritime nation and we have the maritime skill to transport all sort of hazardous substance if need be to our island nation we have the skill the people the port and the shipping line to do that ask the right hon member not to speculate on what be on the solong because that have not be establish there have be multiple press report and once know for sure will inform the house appropriately remind the whole house that the united kingdom be world leader in maritime insurance this be what we do we trade bring good and service across the world and we insure those good and service we should all be proud of both our maritime sector and the insurance sector too pay tribute to everyone involve in the emergency response do the minister share my deep concern that more than hour after this collision we still do not know what the cargo be on the mv solong surely the insurance industry ought to know that at the very least on the pollution understand that this incident may have take place in or close to two marine protect area be those area affect what be the plan for clean they up the minister mention that pollution measure be in wait but have not be implement because the priority be reduce the fire but understand that the stena immaculate the one with hundred of thousand of tonne of fuel oil be no long burn what measure be be take to tackle the pollution now speed be of the essence think the incident start at about minute to yesterday so we be only about hour in within minute asset be stand up and the crew be bring safely home except for one member of the solong we have asset in place to measure the pollution now and those asset be be deploy where that be safe but the priority remain get the fire out on the solong several hon member have mention the effect on the marine environment include endangered bird specie such as puffin and kittiwake which be return to colony right now in place like the isle of may in my constituency what engagement be the minister have with the charity and organisation who run those colony secondly follow the question from the hon member for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter about the scottish government if as we fear we see the case scenario of pollution extend extensively be there any plan for engagement between the environment agency and scottish environment protection agency the environment be absolutely at the front of our mind once we get the fire out we will make those impact assessment and take the appropriate measure to clean up pollution if there be any the department be work across government and with the local resilience forum in the day ahead once we have the impact assessment we will liaise with partner agency on the good way forward on bird marine and fish protection and the environment join the minister in pay tribute to all those emergency service that respond but the unknown the cargo of the solong be major concern to many in the chamber and many who be work to deal with the incident what engagement on this issue have the minister have with the un international maritime organisation which have responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine and atmospheric pollution by ship what step will be take to learn from it will we engage with the imo to ensure that all cargo at sea be know by someone we be in discussion with the owner of both vessel

that the priority be deal with the immediate incident and that there will be full investigation by the maritime accident investigation branch in due course give that the royal navy have deploy vessel to the north sea to monitor hostile state activity on and under the sea will the minister assure we that the government and their agency will undertake an assessment so that we can be clear that there have be no foreign interference in this terrible accident the answer be yes the ministry of defence contact last night to say that it be ready and willing to be deploy if require so far that have not be require because we feel that there be no malign intent in this incident however as the hon member say the marine accident investigation branch will investigate and give its initial finding as soon

committee and the other member of the public bill committee for provide substantial debate and scrutiny the government plan to make work pay be core part of our mission to grow the economy raise living standard across the country and create opportunity for all it will tackle the low pay poor working condition and poor job security that have be hold our economy back the bill be the first phase of deliver our plan to make work pay support employer worker and union by raise the minimum floor of employment right raise living standard across the country and level the play field for those business that be engage in good practice this be landmark bill that once implement will represent the big upgrade in employment right for generation it be therefore important that we get the detail right the amendment be put forward by the government directly demonstrate our commitment to full and comprehensive consultation on the detail of the plan to make work pay on march we publish five consultation response relate to key area of the bill that package represent the first phase of formal public consultation on how good to put our plan into practice we have also undertake extensive engagement with more than stakeholder organisation in addition to the formal consultation we have make great effort to listen to the range of view from business trade union representative organisation civil society and other the insight gain have be invaluable in inform the amendment to ensure the bill work in practice both for worker and for business of all size across the whole country the amendment will strengthen the bill provide further detail and clarity on measure and ensure such measure can be implement in straightforward way turn to the detail of the amendment the government have table range of amendment in relation to zero hour measure these amendment will help ensure that the zero hour contract reform work for worker and employer support culture where secure work and prosperous growth go hand in hand amendment in relation to clause cover the right to guarantee hour will clarify requirement where worker work for an employer under more than one contract at the same time clarify that under guarantee hour offer if it be accept work must be provide by the employer for the hour set out and that those hour must be work by the worker and enable worker to take case to an employment tribunal on the ground that an employer deliberately structure the worker hour or offer work in such way as to make reduce guarantee hour offer or to avoid have to make an offer at all give the urgent necessity to promote growth surely the acid test of bill such as this be whether it will actually make it more attractive for entrepreneur to create job what be the answer the answer be in the department press release which cite simon deakin professor of law at the university of cambridge no less he have say the consensus on the economic impact of labour law be that far from be harmful to growth they contribute positively to productivity labour law also help ensure that growth be more inclusive and that gain be distribute more widely across society be sure that the right hon member want to see that happen amendment in relation to the right in clause and to reasonable notice of shift and payment for short notice cancellation curtailment and movement of shift will ensure that the right work appropriately for worker whose contract specify the timing of at least some of their shift provide that worker be entitle to payment from their employer only for shift cancel move or curtail at short notice if they reasonably believe they would be need to work the shift and allow employer to disclose personal information about worker in notice of exception where appropriate and in accordance with data protection law and ensure that the usual burden of proof apply where it be allege that such notice be untrue the minister will have see the appalling evidence that the business and trade committee take from mcdonald where the bbc investigation expose allegation from hundred of young worker who be suffer harassment and even allegation from one worker of manager solicit they for sex in return for scheduling shift the tightening up that he propose be very welcome when do he think he will set out the when will he set out the detail of for example the period of time that someone must work before be offer zero hour contract thank the chairman of the select committee for his question we be aim to work on this once the bill have pass this stage and consultation will take place in due course have to say that the chuntering from those on the conservative benches really show how they fail to appreciate the power imbalance that there be in some workplace and the exploitation and harassment that arise from that our measure on guarantee hour reasonable notice of shift and payment for short notice cancellation seek to ensure that worker often in fragmented sector with little voice of their own do not bear all the risk of uncertain demand however we recognise that there be case where union and employer work together may want to agree more tailored right than the provision allow which would benefit both the worker and the employer give the unique context of that particular sector union business and trade association have make case for that flexibility in their meeting with we we want to allow for that while also provide baseline for sector where unionisation be uncommon or agreement can not be reach new clause and associated amendment will allow employer and union to collectively agree to modify or opt out of the zero hour contract measure like the other worker cover by this part of the bill agency worker deserve baseline of security and access to contract that reflect their regular hour many agency worker have preference for guarantee hour accord to survey evidence we know that of agency worker request permanent contract with their hirer between january and september accord to the department for business and trade agency worker survey we be keen not to see wholesale shift from directly engage worker to agency worker as way for employer to avoid the zero hour provision in the bill new clause new schedule and associated amendment will narrow the broad power currently in the bill and instead include provision for similar right to be extend to agency worker hirer agency and agency worker can then be clear where responsibility will rest in relation to the new right these amendment reflect the call for clarity from stakeholder in their response to the government public consultation on this issue give the important role that agency work play in business and public service we recognise the need to work with the recruitment sector employer and trade union to design detailed provision for regulation that work that is regulation that achieve the policy objective of extend right to agency worker without unintended consequence for employment agency and hirer and we will work on that in due course the government have also table amendment in relation to dismissal and redundancy practice this bill will help employer to raise standard in relation to these practice so that the vast majority of business that do the right thing by their worker will no long be undercut by those with low standard have the good fortune to serve with the minister for session in committee and at the end of that we have bill page long we now have page of amendment most of which come from the government why be they table so many amendment and give they just two day scrutiny be these just more union demand have literally just explain how we have be consult with business and trade union and put down amendment as result of course if the hon member be concerned about the length of the amendment paper he can withdraw his own amendment which we will no doubt be debate later on we be table some technical amendment to clause on unfair dismissal that will update cross reference in other legislation to the sum which be the exist cap on the compensation that can be award by an employment tribunal in most unfair dismissal case it be the government intention to end the unscrupulous use of fire and rehire we be propose technical amendment that allow the clause to work as intend to provide those protection they ensure that once the provision of the bill that make unfair dismissal day one right come into force the automatic unfair dismissal protection from unscrupulous fire and rehire practice will apply once the employee start work this bring the provision in line with other change to unfair dismissal these amendment also make it clear that the person will be protect from fire and rehire when they be dismiss and then rehire to do exactly the same job as they be do previously but on bad condition clause will modernise the collective redundancy framework to ensure that it work for employee and employer alike we have listen to feedback from business on the clause as introduce which require consultation whenever or more redundancy be propose to be make across an employer organisation business tell we that this would have put they in constant state of consultation so the change propose would ensure that this clause extend protection for employee while limit burden for employer the amendment mean that collective redundancy obligation will be trigger where or more redundancy be propose at one establishment in line with the exist law or the number of propose redundancy across the organisation meet certain threshold the government will set this threshold out in due course via secondary legislation this will happen after we have consult ensure that it balance the need of grow business with the interest of employee this could be proportion of employee in business suitable number of employee across business or some other threshold propose through detailed consultation employer will also be require to notify the government of redundancy that meet the threshold set in secondary legislation the government intention be to ensure that it be more difficult for small and unscrupulous minority of employer to ignore their collective redundancy obligation as we have see in recent year new clause will therefore double the protective award an employment tribunal can make from to day we consult on this and other matter from october to december and after listen carefully to range of response from business and employee representative we have conclude that the maximum period of the protective award an employment tribunal can make should be raise from to day this be on top of change that the government have already make from january this year employment tribunal have have the ability to uplift the protective award by up to where an employer unreasonably fail to follow the code of practice on dismissal and re engagement we recognise that responsible employer up and down the country already go far than their current obligation to collectively consult and will continue to do so they recognise that collective consultation with their workforce can be valuable in find solution to the challenge that business face we will publish new code of practice to guide employer on their collective consultation obligation and promote the way good employer be work with their employee to arrive at mutually beneficial outcome so that all business be require to do the same the government be also table amendment in relation to the bill provision on flexible working and dismissal during pregnancy the bill will increase the baseline set of right for employee with parental responsibility enable more work parent to get on at work and achieve well work life balance whether they be raise child or look after love one with long term health condition business will gain too where this boost workforce participation and help employer to fill vacancy these amendment will ensure that these provision work as intend clause add new power to make provision for non redundancy dismissal during or after the protect period of pregnancy the amendment will add supplementary provision to this power this be to ensure that the regulation can clearly set out detail as part of define the circumstance in which pregnant woman can still be fairly dismiss we will work with stakeholder on how to exercise these power in regulation amendment to clause propose that the flexible work measure in the bill be add to those provision in scope of section of the employment rights act that mean that the security service gchq and the secret intelligence service will be exempt from disclose any information relate to flexible working request if in the opinion of minister it would be contrary to national security in those instance the employer would not need to disclose the reason for refuse request the government be move amendment on statutory sick pay in our plan to make work

under the new model they would receive only be that correct yes but the hon member forget the fact that we be remove the waiting day with the provision on the low earning limit go million people will be access statutory sick pay we think that that be the right balance and that it will leave people in much well position of course it be something that we will always continue to review move on to umbrella company we be aware of non compliance in this market where umbrella company can be responsible for deny employment right to those who work through they new clause will allow for the regulation of umbrella company and for enforcement by the employment agency standards inspectorate and subsequently the fair work agency the specific requirement on umbrella company will be set out in the relevant regulation which set out the minimum standard of conduct for employment agency and employment business we will consult before amend these regulation and we be commit to work with the sector to ensure that future regulation work effectively for umbrella company the amendment mark an important step towards ensure non compliant umbrella company be no long able to deny worker the right they be owe the government be move range of amendment in relation to part of the bill which cover the adult social care negotiate body and the school support staff negotiate body on the sssnb the government be move two technical amendment to correct incorrect cross reference the body be an important part of deliver both the government plan to make work pay and our opportunity mission the government will today commit to consult in the summer on whether agency worker should be bring into scope of the sssnb in future legislation to support those mission could the minister clarify for the house whether the provision on the school support staff negotiate body will provide ceiling as well as floor on pay or will it just be floor there be certainly number of school and academy leader who say they want to pay above what the government might recommend for support staff and that this may limit they from do so that be debate in detail in committee my understanding be that there will be floor but there will not be ceiling if be wrong about that will come back to that we absolutely think that floor be need give some of the issue with low pay in this country amendment to the adult social care negotiate body provision will remove clause thereby remove the power to make stand alone enforcement provision in respect of the agreement reach by negotiate body enforcement of pay term under agreement will instead be in the remit of the new fair work agency under schedule the minister be rattle off whole list of amendment that appear to have come after the legislation have go through committee do he not understand that that create massive burden on many business would it not be well to accept that the government have go little overboard with the bill and to start afresh with proper consultation with business at ground level the reason why we be put so many amendment down be because we have be consult and work with business and that be why we have so much to say today it be labour party commitment to launch an employment rights bill within day of take office and be proud that we have deliver on that commitment and that we have this bill here today in that consultation how many small business express their support for the bill refer the right hon member to our departmental press release where at least half dozen business representative and business have express support and of course there be many more business out there indeed visit one only recently that support the bill would the minister be kind enough to name one of those business on the press release interruption he have well look at the press release just to check there be the co op quite big business richer sounds centrica and the british chambers of commerce these be not bit part player at all be they new clause seek to ensure that agency worker in the adult social care sector who do not have worker contract within the meaning of employment legislation would nevertheless be able to bring claim in the employment tribunal or in civil proceeding where fair pay agreement have be breach it do that by deem contract to exist for this purpose between the worker and the party that pay they that will allow such worker to bring an unlawful deduction of wage claim or breach of contract claim for breach of fair pay agreement term new clause and associated amendment will enable the scottish and welsh ministers to establish their own separate negotiating body and associate framework and to enable their negotiating body and the result agreement to cover social care worker in both adult and child social care care policy funding and commissioning be deliver together in both wales and scotland in england the two workforce and therefore the policy and delivery be distinct as such it be right for scotland and wales to have the power to set up negotiate body that can provide for their system and workforce as they be now these amendment and associated consequential amendment will allow the devolved ministers to exercise certain power in this chapter of the bill with the consent of the secretary of state ensure that the secretary of state retain oversight of regulation relate to the reserved matter of employment and industrial relation amendment to clause supplement the power to make regulation in relation to record keeping it will enable those regulation to apply to section of the national minimum wage act in order to prevent employer from try to contract out of their new record keeping obligation before wind up will address some other amendment will take this

member for lowestoft and the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones member share many powerful story from their constituent every part of

mention the british chambers of commerce have just visit its website which state the british chambers of commerce have use an evidence session on the employment rights bill to highlight business serious concern about the legislation and the speed and detail of consultation will the minister withdraw his comment be glad that the hon member have access to the internet direct he to the department webpage where he will see that jane gratton deputy director of public policy at the british chambers of commerce say there be much here to welcome as sensible move that will help ensure that employment work for both the business and the individual that be in response to the amendment so it be much more up to date comment than the one the hon member mention return to the important

government be steadfastly commit to deliver our manifesto commitment to halve violence against woman and girl and we will publish cross government strategy shortly intend to work with colleague to

disclosure agreement in some circumstance that important issue warrant further consideration the government be press ahead with plan to implement the provision relevant to nda in the victims and prisoners act and the higher education freedom of speech act we take nda misuse seriously and will continue to look into it to see what we can do new clause in the name of the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel focus on whistleblowing and protect disclosure that area have be so important in recent public scandal include the post office fujitsu scandal and the lucy letby case may urge the minister to consider that new clause impose duty on big employer to look at and investigate protect disclosure be vital way of move forward on that key legislation have begin to consider it as that legislation be now quarter of century old and need look at in the light of experience in number of the scandal that have be mention we be consider where we go next on whistleblowe legislation to conclude britain work people and business be the drive force of the uk economy and the bill will help to create labour market that deliver for both it will deliver significant benefit to the uk include well working condition more secure work reduced inequality and improve industrial relation appreciate that have outline lot of detail today but it be important to remember that as be typical with any legislation of this nature many of the policy will be provide for through regulation and in some case through code of practice we expect further consultation on these reform to begin later in the year when we will seek significant input from stakeholder be grateful for member effort to improve the bill and for their scrutiny and debate so far look forward to hear further debate this afternoon call the shadow minister after sitting in the public bill committee the government be still table hundred of amendment to the bill that highlight once again that their false political deadline of day in which to publish the bill be foolhardy they should have take well time this be bad bill although it contain many good and well intentione measure the government have fail to get the balance right between employee and employer although welcome some of the minister comment not least on bereavement leave for pregnancy loss on which we speak at length and agree in committee be afraid that the government have get the balance wrong in the vast majority of the bill the amendment in the name of right hon and hon friend in his majesty loyal opposition seek to highlight how the bill simply go too far in too many regard it will affect our economy it will affect the number of people who have job and it will affect the willingness of employer the wealth and job creator to take on new staff to grow to put new product line in place and to keep employ people thank my hon friend for give way and doff my cap to he for his sitting in committee when the regulatory policy committee consider the bill it say that eight of the impact assessment be not fit for purpose be he any more confident that that have be rectify through the amendment be sorry to have to report to my hon friend that no do not have great confidence that the bill will work he be right that the rpc place so much of the bill in the red column at severe risk and identify it as not fit for purpose some of the amendment in my name and those of right hon and hon friend to which will speak in more detail in moment seek to explore far the impact that the measure in the bill will have on the economy and to answer the point that he rightly outline fundamentally we know that every labour government leave unemployment high than when they start the difference with this one be that they be actually legislate for that outcome will turn first to new clause and amendment when we be in government we ban exclusivity clause in zero hour contract we know that this flexibility work for many employee on zero hour contract such as student and those with summer job or other responsibility employee can value that this bill impose statist top down government know good approach which will limit flexibility for both employer and employee visit the nelson arms in farnham recently and meet the publican who employ lot of people on zero hour contract one of whom in addition to work in the pub work as paramedic because the flexibility allow he to do both job these be the sort of people who will be impact by this legislation my hon friend be absolutely right be attend wedding in farnham later this year and look forward to visit the nelson arms and thank his constituent for the service he also give as paramedic be the shadow minister aware that the tuc survey clearly show that the vast majority of people on zero hour contract really want regular hour can he respond to that the hon gentleman say it be the vast majority do not know whether it be the vast majority but some people of course will want the guarantee of the hour he talk about the point be make be about allow flexibility for those for whom it do work give the example of student and my hon friend the member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford give another example of someone for whom this flexibility work that be not to say that there be not many people in our economy who do seek the change the hon gentleman want but it be not universal rule and it should not simply be apply to everyone gently invite he to reflect on the impact this will have on people such as those my hon friend the member for farnham and bordon refer to have the shadow minister actually read the bill do he understand that the flexibility include be the flexibility to ask for guarantee hour and if student or somebody do second job do not want those guarantee hour they do not need to have they be happy to confirm to the hon lady that have read the bill and have read considerable number of document from the house of commons library and many other organisation have speak to lot of business in my constituency as well as far afield who can assure she be horrify at the bill the minister be ask early to name single small business that support the bill and his answer be the co op and centrica the last time look neither of those would be consider small business will my hon friend give way rise will give way one more time and then will make some progress do it worry my hon friend that once again the government have reveal they be desperately hop that company such centrica do become small business my right hon friend make very good point in his stylish witty manner as my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans say the regulatory policy committee have give red rating to the identification of option and choice of policy on zero hour contract and guarantee hour in the bill that mean the government have not justify the necessity of clause to what be the problem the government be try to solve with those clause why be those clause need we just do not know the bill despite literally hundred of government amendment remain silent about how these provision will work in practice which mean the government assessment that the administrative cost of the bill to business in shift and workforce planning will be million could well be an underestimate the deputy ceo of ukhospitality raise their concern in committee say the government be intend to leave it to case law and employment tribunal system to figure out what reasonable notice mean official report employment rights public bill committee november that be an unacceptable way to legislate business crave certainty and stable regulatory environment this bill provide anything but and the result as the chair of the cbi have say be that it risk become an adventure playground for employment right lawyer my hon friend be learn man and he may have see the report in the financial times that for the first time ever the number of company register at companies house have fall do he think this bill be on the horizon have anything to do with that particularly give the point that have be make about it not be fit for purpose my hon friend make an exceptional point the bill categorically will be play part in that along with the budget of broken promise the increase in employer ni and so on shudder to think what will happen when the bill become law we understand the parliamentary arithmetic we understand that the government will force this through and that be the reason we have table new clause and amendment new clause would require the secretary of state to conduct review of the impact of section to on the operation of employment tribunal and the ability of employment tribunal to manage any increase in application result from those section amendment would place commencement block on clause to we believe that those clause should not come into force until the review require by new clause have be approve by parliament both business and employee will struggle when claim be bring because of the confusion create by the bill if the employment tribunal be not able to cope with the increase caseload will the shadow minister give way will happily give way in one moment government members should have their eye open to the consequence of this badly think out legislation perhaps the hon lady will open her eye to that point these measure will ensure protection for all the million people in the uk with irregular work pattern be it zero hour contract or agency contract can the shadow minister tell the house why he think agency worker do not deserve the same protection as everyone else the hon lady make point that she make in committee it be good to debate with she and other in committee we have genuine and robust debate what be argue for be flexibility and recognition of how the employment market and our economy work in real life to treat everything with one universal rule will be disaster for our economy fear that it will result in few people in work and few job in the economy and it certainly will not deliver the growth that this government pretend they want to see will the shadow minister give way how can resist the hon gentleman do the shadow minister not accept that it be due to the expendability of employee in the workplace that we have such poor rate of productivity in this country particularly compare with france and germany greatly respect the hon gentleman and we have work together on number of issue in recent year but do not accept his point be there room to improve productivity of course there be there be room to improve productivity across all sector all the time we would not grow the economy if we could not do that however the bill take sledgehammer to crack the proverbial nut apply universal rule for all will not deliver what the hon gentleman nobly wish to achieve in the economy as be often the case in politic the thing that divide we be not the end goal or the point we want to get to it be the mean of get there do not think the bill will deliver what he want to achieve he look like he want to intervene again want to make progress but will give he one last go the shadow minister be be very generous be make simple point it be less motivating and of less interest to company to invest in machinery and plant if it can ultimately change the structure of its workforce or expend they through fire and rehire that be what be hold we back and that be why we have deficit to france and germany in term of productivity the hon gentleman make an interesting point but do not see business out there that want to expend or get rid of their workforce or disinvest in they and he be give very pessimistic outlook of the way that the business environment run in this country business want to innovate they want to grow and employ more people they want to make more money make money be not something people should look down their nose at it be fundamentally good thing that create wealth grow the economy and increase the tax base to pay for the service that we all want do not share the hon gentleman view of the world when it come to the bill and the point he be try to make listen to the debate it be clear that there be conservative members who understand business and who come to this place with year of if labour member would stop heckle for one moment they might start to listen if we want to increase productivity that be about employee but it be also about employer be able to invest in their staff through training contract plant and machinery it be whole raft of thing none of which we can do if business be stifle with red tape and employment law or measure that be basically about law through the court agree with my right hon friend the crux of what she say be the difference between the approach of conservative members to economy and the way that labour members and those on the other left wing benches look at the economy the left of british politic tend to view everything through the lens of business be bad of all employer seek to exploit their workforce and of an image of victorian factory from novel of that era in reality we must recognise the symbiotic relationship between employer and employee because we do not grow the economy without thing work in both their interest the bill seek to tip the balance too far in one direction forget that that will take away the incentive for employer the wealth creator to get on and grow let move to new clause and amendment conservative members have absolutely no issue with the right to request flexible working indeed conservative in government pass the employment relations flexible working act that make it easy for employee to make flexible working request give they statutory right to do so and require employer to consider and discuss any request make by their employee more quickly that legislation appear to be work indeed the regulatory policy committee have say that there be little evidence present that employer be reject request unreasonably spend year as solicitor work in employment right predominantly for employee and periodically for employer and assure the hon gentleman that flexible working be not work for many mother in this country many woman be give up job and become self employ because their employer will not agree their flexible working request it be good to hear from real solicitor who give her wealth of knowledge to this area be not try to suggest that everything be perfect and work well fully accept the fair and good point that the hon lady make about many mother get back into the workplace or extend their career but the bill be not the answer she be look for if she look at it in more detail the rpc give the government impact assessment for flexible working provision red rating and that go to the nub of the point be there room for improvement of course there be but the impact assessment for the flexible provision in the bill be give red rating not fit for purpose once again ask the minister this what problem be the government try to solve with clause before rush to pile more red tape on business through the bill do the government consider option such as raise awareness of the right to request flexible working our new clause require the secretary of state to assess the impact that clause will have on employment wage and economic output will the hon gentleman give way one more crack yes assure the hon gentleman that woman absolutely do know about the right to request flexible working and that be not the source of the problem they be face the hon lady almost make the point for early make the very point that we introduce that right it be work well yet the rpc say that the provision in the bill will do nothing for it and be not fit for purpose thank she for her intervention new clause call for consideration of the likelihood of the cost of flexible work measure be pass on to employee through low wage and of the likely effect that the right to request flexible working will have on productivity wage growth equality of opportunity job security economic activity and employment equally it require that report set out that those finding must be lay before each house of parliament no soon than week after the consultation have be initiate the hon gentleman have just say that there may be area where we could go far on flexible working can he explain why the previous government flexible working taskforce meet just once last year and just once the year before as with the long await employment bill that never materialise be it the case that this government be bring forward real measure because the previous government vacate that territory the hon gentleman with whom we debate these matter at length in committee clearly have not listen to what say detail how we do legislate in this area yet this government be bring forward bill that the rpc in this respect have give red rating and say be not fit for purpose gently urge he to look again at this issue and at where we can agree on area that could go far or be different from measure set out in either exist or propose legislation we must understand the impact that measure in the bill will have on the real economy amendment would ensure that clause could not come into force until parliament have approve that report to put it simply the genesis of the amendment be that the government have not do their homework and they have no idea what they be do or why we know that these provision will damage business which in turn will hurt worker and we want labour members to acknowledge that it will be ordinary people who pay the price let turn to new clause and amendment and clause which make employer liable for harassment of their employee by third party be another example of the government put more regulation on business without know the problem they be try to solve the independent regulatory policy committee have say that the government have not manage sufficiently to demonstrate the need for the third party harassment provision in the bill and have once again rat this impact assessment as red it should go without say that conservative members do not condone any form of harassment in the workplace when we be in government we legislate to put duty on employer to take reasonable step to anticipate and prevent sexual harassment horrible evil crime that be cover by other legislation to protect everybody in the country double underline that we be not condone sexual harassment indeed we legislate clearly to clamp down on that evil and heinous crime however would be interested in any evidence the minister have for the prevalence of third party harassment in the workplace and of how clause might solve that because the government have not produce that evidence so far will the hon member give way will make some progress as think have demonstrate that be not shy of give way and will come back to the hon lady the problem be that badly consider law develop with no evidence base be likely to cause problem rather than to solve they that be the law of unintended consequence we be deeply concerned about not just the unclear liability that the clause place on employer but the implication it have for freedom of expression the equality and human rights commission have say that the third party harassment protection raise complex question about the appropriate balance between third party right to freedom of expression as protect under article echr and employee protection from harassment and their right to private and family life we be already struggle to ensure freedom of speech at our university place that should be guardian of free open and challenging debate it be of course my private member bill that the previous government support but only partly because third party harassment be scrub out of the bill be very pleased that the new government be reintroduce that bit the question be why do the hon gentleman support the idea that employer should prevent sexual harassment in the workplace and demonstrate that they have take all reasonable step but think that for third party that impact on freedom of speech it do not make sense if the hon lady will allow to continue it will become clear why we take such position will give some concrete example in few moment of where the law of unintended consequence will kick in on this provision study by the higher education policy institute find that quiet no platforming where student decide not to invite otherwise suitable speaker to an event because of their view be more common than report case of no platforming speaker quietly no platforme include alex salmond liam neeson harry enfield tony blair one that those on the labour benches might blink at and peter hitchens although this clause be well meaning it be likely to make matter bad as james murray the legal director of doyle clayton have point out this clause could well cause difficulty for university in offer platform to discuss issue on which those listening may have differ view my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to the problem in university it have particularly find form in no platforme speaker deem to be unacceptable or to make people feel uncomfortable because of their view on transsexual for example kathleen stock distinguished academic and feminist be no platforme in exactly that way because of her view that sex be biological fact this clause need to be examine in that context welcome much about this bill particularly on trade union and zero hour contract as it happen but feel that this one area need to be look at again by the government for the very reason that my hon friend make clear totally agree with my right hon friend that this area need to be look at again to ensure that those unintended consequence that challenge freedom of speech in this country be not allow to come through double underline that we have no truck with harassment we absolutely believe that it should be stamp out use criminal law where necessary to ensure that perpetrator be bring to justice this bill open the door to unintended consequence will help the hon gentleman to come back to the point two in three young woman have experience sexual harassment or verbal abuse in the workplace it be important that where they be in customer face role they be protect from abuse both by their colleague and manager and by their customer that be particularly important if they work in university bar another sort of bar or shop or retail setting be very pleased to have take the first piece of evidence about the nature and extent of workplace sexual harassment when work for the tuc in and be sad that it have take we decade to get to the point where we say no more sexual harassment by customer and client the conservative party could have achieve that much more quickly if it have just accept the private member bill put forward by the hon member for bath wera hobhouse do not think that the hon lady be actually disagree with what have say so far sexual harassment be clearly crime it be already crime and any perpetrator of it should be bring to justice that be cover by different law will the shadow minister give way in moment to answer the hon member for tipton and wednesbury antonia bance the point be get at be not about sexual harassment or anything else cover in the criminal law for example if somebody who be wait on table or serve at bar in hospitality set overhear conversation that they find themselves deeply offend by perhaps around the situation in israel and gaza right now this bill will the shadow minister give way will give way to the hon lady in moment this bill would criminalise and bring in the banter police and so on just because people be express perfectly legitimate political view that somebody else find offensive double underline that sexual harassment be absolutely on point of order madam deputy speaker the shadow minister be in danger of mislead the house nothing that he have refer to be crime sexual harassment as deal with in this bill be civil matter deal with by tribunal thank the hon lady for her point of order that be in fact point of debate rather than point of order will get back to james murray the legal director of doyle clayton who have point out that this clause could well cause difficulty for university in offer those platform to discuss issue where people have differ view he say if we think about speaker that have be invite say it controversial gender critical speaker like julie bindel or kathleen stock someone might somewhat disingenuously say that they be an employee of the university and that they find what they say to be deeply harass he also say the concern be that this will shift the balance away from free speech and university will be more risk averse as they will want to be hold liable for third party harassment why do the government want to run that risk there be then the burden on business particularly in the hospitality sector will the shadow minister give way the hon gentleman have have go he may come back later kate nicholls the chief executive of ukhospitality say that staff in restaurant bar pub and hotel work in social environment where there be joke and people be boisterous she say that while everyone want to ensure that their staff be protect we do want to be police our customer and she be concern that this clause could add undue restriction if someone work in pub or comedy club for example there be high risk that they might hear comment that they do not like but it be wrong to restrict free speech just because somebody do not like something the unintended consequence of this provision be likely to be chilling effect on free speech and unclear responsibility for employer about where they need to draw the line rise rise will make some progress have be on my foot for long time and know that lot of people wish to speak in this debate in other word this clause could well function as banter ban at good and as restriction on academic debate and inquiry due to our concern about how this clause will operate especially in the high education and hospitality sector we have table amendment which would carve out the hospitality sector and sport venue from clause we believe those be the sector where the potential for unintended consequence from this clause will be the great it be because we believe that clause will create problem rather than solve they that we have table new clause which would require the secretary of state to report on the clause the report must include the extent to which the prevalence of third party harassment make the case for the measure in clause include an assessment of the impact of the clause on free speech an assessment of the likely cost of the clause to employer an assessment of which occupation might be at particular risk of third party harassment through no fault of the employer and proposal for mitigation that can be put in place for employer employ people in such occupation we will require the secretary of state to lay report set those out before each house of parliament and amendment would prevent clause from come into force until that report be approve by parliament the government need to go away and think again and that be what our amendment be design to achieve if the government be not willing to do so we have also table amendment which would leave the clause out of the bill entirely so great be our concern about the unintended consequence it could have will the shadow minister give way once more since we be discuss this issue for the good part of the previous parliament can ask the shadow minister whether there be misunderstanding about what this part of the bill do it be about preventive duty not predict everything that could happen in the hospitality sector for example the guidance be to make sure that everybody know that their workplace will protect people from harassment that be what an employer need to do what be the problem with that be not sure that the hon lady have firmly grasp what the bill say in this respect of course we want to protect everybody in our society that be the first duty of government but do not think she have fully consider the unintended consequence in the real world particularly in the hospitality sector will speak briefly to new clause and amendment and clause and schedule be another example of the government rush to legislate in an attempt to meet an arbitrary deadline set by the deputy prime minister with chaotic result clause will remove the qualifying period for unfair dismissal again the regulatory policy committee slap red rating on the government impact assessment for these provision mean that the government have not adequately justify the need for they they have admit that they do not have robust datum on the incidence of dismissal for those under two year of employment in other word yet again we do not know whether there be even an actual problem with unfair dismissal for this bill to try to solve the british chambers of commerce have say that member say that there would be reduced hire appetite be this legislation to come in and that they would be less likely to recruit new employee due to the risk and difficulty particularly under the day one right unless there be at least nine month probation report employment rights public bill committee november as such our new clause require the secretary of state to assess the impact of the provision of clause and schedule and amendment require parliament specifically to approve that impact before these section of the bill can come into force will the shadow minister give way be mindful of time and do not wish to incur madam deputy speaker wrath so will make progress we have also table amendment which would remove clause from the bill entirely so concerned be we about how damaging it will be to both employer and employee particularly those who will not get work as direct consequence of these requirement our new clause seem perfectly sensible thing to ask for simple requirement that the secretary of state must have regard to the objective of economic growth and improve the international competitiveness of the uk economy when make regulation under part and of the bill if agree to though it would of course be wreck amendment because the government do not know how they intend to give effect to the provision on guarantee hour the extension of those provision to agency worker or the provision on unfair dismissal to name but few all of those thing will be leave to regulation after the bill be pass without proper scrutiny from this place and it will be work people who pay the price our new clause would clamp down on public sector employer use positive discrimination under section and of the equality act where it cause detriment to other employee and would promote merit base employment practice taxpayer rightly expect that their money should be spend well and part of offer value for money be that taxpayer money should be ruthlessly focus on improve the public service on which all of our constituent rely that always mean hire on merit amendment which deal with the school support staff negotiate body be the last of our amendment that will speak to in the then conservative secretary of state for education michael gove abolish the school support staff negotiate body the conservative government have clear and principled reason for this employer should have the flexibility to set pay and condition locally rather than have top down centralise framework impose on they it be to allow school leader who know well than politician in whitehall to innovate and do what work well for their school their pupil and their employee instead of give employer flexibility to do what work well for they the government be re establish national term and condition handbook training career progression route and pay rate for school support staff that all school employer will be oblige to follow we believe that the current arrangement for employ school support staff be work well will the shadow minister give way have explain that do not wish to incur madam deputy speaker wrath which fear be close at this point so will make some progress the current arrangement have also allow for innovation that be beneficial for pupil we believe that school employer must retain degree of freedom and flexibility to recruit develop remunerate and deploy their staff for the benefit of the child in their community to achieve their particular aim from school improvement or inclusion perspective urge the government to consider this there be many more amendment that could speak to madam deputy speaker but will not will only say that this be bad bit of legislation and some of the amendment we be consider particularly those table by the government make the bill bad in many respect they add to the already heavy burden on business burden that will combat growth will slap down growth and will mean that the government will not achieve the objective they have set out to achieve in their landmark mission road sign and whatever else they have announce therefore urge the government to consider our amendment go back and tame the bad excess of this job destroy bill rise order before call the chair of the business and trade select committee want to make clear that will then call steve darling the liberal democrat spokesperson immediately after mr darling there will be six minute time limit call liam byrne thank you very much indeed madam deputy speaker be go to be very brief will just make three quick point and will do my good to salvage degree of consensus from the conflict that have characterise this debate at its outset if there be couple of thing that unite we across this house it be that we all believe in fair play and we all believe in an honest day pay for an honest day work however the reality be that million of worker in this country be simply not earn their fair share of the wealth that we produce together if labour income be the same share of national income as it be back in the something like year would go into the pay packet of every single one of the million worker in this country as such follow decade that have see million people trap in low pay and during which we have have living standard crisis it behove each and every one of we to think more creatively and constructively about how we support worker in this economy to earn good life for they and their family we on the business and trade committee have the privilege of hear from some of the good employer in the country but we also have the duty of interrogate many firm that frankly have be let down our country will highlight three example in order to illustrate some of the amendment that have be table in my name and in the name of other right hon and hon member they be not amendment that wish to press to division they be probe amendment on which think the minister need to provide the house with some answer will start with mcdonald which reference in an early intervention it be one of the most significant employer in our country employ over people some of mcdonald worker be on zero hour contract on the day of our hearing bbc investigation by zoe conway its employment correspondent expose the reality that hundred of mcdonald employee be contact the bbc and the ehrc with allegation of the most appalling harassment we hear about the case of year old mcdonald worker who allege that she be be ask for sex in return for manager give she the shift that she want how on earth can that be acceptable in today economy yet when we put that point to the chief executive of mcdonald and ask do you think that the imbalance of power that have flourish in mcdonald because of your worker be on zero hour contract have anything to do with this litany of abuse or with worker contact their solicitor to bring case against mcdonald the answer be no it be an absolutely extraordinary denial of reality we then hear from evri which as many people know be one of the most significant courier firm in the country employ ten of thousand of people mr hugo martin come before our committee to give evidence and tell we that all at evri be sweetness and light however the committee have now receive hundred upon hundred of complaint from whistleblower allege that they be be cheat and undercut most recently through the rate cut the packet racket which be still persist health and safety abuse at work intimidation bullying and harassment they be be tell repeatedly that their shift will be cut or that they will be out of the door if they do not work six day week our constituent be experience this completely unacceptable behaviour must be careful about scope at this point madam deputy speaker but we also hear from the company shein which could not even tell we whether the product that it make contained cotton from china we be simply try to understand whether worker in our country be be undercut by an abuse of modern slavery practice abroad say to the house that although we may have our difference on the bill we must accept the reality that million of people in this country million of the people we be send here to represent be be treat in way that should be unacceptable in century economy what the good employer tell the committee time and again be that they support the spirit of the bill although of course they have concern about the detail and it be good that the minister be listen what they do not want to see persist be the situation that they fear in which the good firm be be undercut by the bad we must have level playing field in this country that will be necessity if we be to win global race to the top my amendment to suggest alteration to the zero hour regime that the minister have set out think we should abolish the definition of low hour in contract accept the evidence that be give to we by paddy lillis the brilliant general secretary of the union of shop distributive and allied workers that retain the definition create risk of loophole that will be exploit by bad employer amendment to which might be term the mcdonald amendment urge the secretary of state to put on the face of the bill definition of reasonable notice in relation to the moving of shift and the compensation that should be entail in the event of unreasonable shift movement we need to ensure that our worker particularly young worker be never again subject to the kind of abuse that we have see unfold at mcdonald those day must be consign to the past new clause which might be describe as the evri amendment create an obligation and duty for the secretary of state to bring to the house within six month of the bill come into the force the final version of review of the single status of worker we hear compelling evidence from the director of labour market enforcement who tell we that the government ministers and civil servant could consult until the cow come home we could put off the consultation about the different definition of worker for ever and day when what we need to do be end the kind of abuse that we see at evri now ensure that these loophole be close so that bogus self employment be no long loophole through which bad employer abuse honest worker should like to see the minister step up to that requirement new clause which we might call the shein amendment require the government to update the modern slavery act and section in particular to ensure that the employment right grant in the bill be not undermine by company operate in this country that be abuse this legislation at the time the modern slavery act be world lead legislation but we hear clear evidence from company such as tesco that this country risk become dump ground for bad product produce by worker exploit abroad we can not allow this country which lead the abolition of slavery to be country in which we have second class protection against modern slavery in the century and should therefore welcome commitment from the minister on when the act will be update we welcome some of the government amendment particularly the enhance protection for agency worker and the action on umbrella company both be recommendation in the committee excellent report which commend to all member hope that as result of this debate we can salvage some consensus the bill will go through today and this will be the big overhaul of employment right in the country we must ensure that it last for the future and the more we can do to bring cross party consensus around that simple idea that all worker all constituent in the country should have the right the power and the freedom to earn good life for themselves and their family and the soon we can do it the well call the liberal democrat spokesperson the holy grail seek by all government of whichever hue be economic growth therefore think it important for we to look through the lens of economic growth and to think about whether the bill drive it recall from my time in committee where spend many hour listen to the oratory of the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith that we speak great deal about productivity and whether it would be drive by the bill have speak about the possible impact of the bill to people in my community include representative of enlighten hr and alison benney human resource consultant for whom its destination be very welcome indeed we have hear from many other people who have be consult that the bill destination and aspiration be correct and appropriate but it be question of how we get there and whether the government have achieve the right balance between employer and employee that be important because the last thing we want the bill to do be have chilling effect on the economy we be only too well aware that the national insurance contribution that be set to kick in next month be already have that negative impact and we do not want this well intend bill to echo that far there be amendment before we at this late stage of the legislation the minister say that that be due to level of consultation and so forth and should be welcome and that we be trim our sail but if that be the case and if the minister be in such listen mode in committee why do the government accept no opposition amendment whatsoever should welcome some reflection from the minister when he wind up the debate as liberal democrat and the liberal democrat spokesman for the department for work and pensions can say that carer be at the front and centre of our world what be effectively the population of people year or day walk away from the employment market to take up caring occupation and in many instance support family member that have an billion annual impact on our economy which leave we less productive hope that the government will give serious thought to our amendment to make leave for carer pay opportunity because give they that flexibility and that breathe space would unlock more people for our employment market our proposal to make care protect characteristic be extremely important we have already hear about harassment and discrimination in connection with other part of the bill but this would help immensely to support carer double the pay of those take adoption leave be also important as be support for people who take caring role such as kinship care hope that the ministers will take those family role into account do my hon friend agree that the government have miss an opportunity to recognise the extraordinary contribution of kinship carer in this bill recently meet couple in my constituency who be kinship carer they have act out of love but they have have none of the support that foster parent would have have in look after the child in their care do my hon friend agree that the government would do well to look at include the same employment right for kinship carer as they currently offer to foster parent as somebody who be adopt myself know only too well the importance of supportive love have be heavily involve with child service and know that the good care for child in need of love home be often not too far away from home the more that child service can be less of child rescue service and more of child support service the well so strongly endorse what my hon friend allude to an area that particularly exercise the hon member for mid buckinghamshire in committee be third party harassment and strongly support the government proposal in this bill have engage with young woman in torbay who work in retail and the hospitality industry particularly those from torquay girl grammar school and they find that harassment in the workplace be not bit of banter but repugnant in the extreme they tell that they will go to shift feeling sick to the stomach because they know particular individual will be come in that evening who will act inappropriately their manager should have duty of care toward they and welcome that proposal in the bill know that some of the amendment allude to non disclosure agreement welcome the minister kind word but warm word do not get measure into legislation ask he to reflect on that and be sure that colleague will speak about nda the final area need to cover be probationary period we liberal democrats would really welcome put three to nine month probationary period on the face of the bill which would ensure that there be less chance of expensive tribunal for employer we welcome the step that the government have take in respect of statutory sick pay but we need to ensure that the correct balance be strike between the burden on employer and positive outcome for employee welcome the amendment put forward by the liberal democrats especially new clause to which would extend paternity leave from two to six week and double the amount of pay those precious week be essential for father to bond with their child and to provide additional support to their partner do my hon friend agree that these be essential new clause that the government should accept agree with my hon friend when go and speak to primary school teacher they say that they face challenge where there be poor attachment between the parent and the child which can have significant developmental impact on young people by give great power through this bill we can drive strong connection between those part of the family unit the reality be that we need to support small business and get the right balance between implement the good stuff in this bill and make sure that we be not punish business we need to make sure that we support the family because as have say the family be the core part of what our society be and strengthen that will hopefully strengthen outcome and strengthen our society my fear be that this bill be little bit like snow white apple it may have look extremely good on the outside but it send she to sleep my fear be that this bill be little like that because it may have lot of promise on the outside but it could be sleep potion for our economy give my full support to the measure in the bill without question they be some of the most progressive in this area of legislation for decade my new clause seek to set up work time council comprise business trade union government departments and expert on the subject to advise the secretary of state on how the transition from five day week to four day week would affect employer and employee and on how business public body and other organisation should approach such transition virtually every progressive change in employment legislation over the decade have be pooh poohe by the conservative party leopard do not change their spot as we have see in spade today in the evidence session the minister ask some witness what the productivity implication of some of the proposal contain in the bill would be the answer from professor simon deakin of cambridge university be that there be strong correlation between strong labour protection and both productivity and innovation he go on to say that research show that on average strengthen employment law in this country in the last year have have pro employment effect for various reason official report employment rights public bill committee november know the shadow minister be there when professor deakin say that historically it be well trodden path for some to object to measure that would advance employment right even if those right be of advantage to everyone concern be it employer employee or society more generally that be especially so in the medium to long term because legislature do not just legislate for today they also legislate for tomorrow thank the minister my admiration for he know no bound and other member for the work that they have put into this bill my primary aim in table new clause be to try to get the debate about the four day week out of the block accept that the notion be challenging but that be not reason to put off the debate the discussion have to be have it be over year since the introduction of five day week in different industry which be down to the influence of henry ford who be not the most radical of people in the the introduction of the two day weekend for those work at his car factory be pivotal moment he argue that it would boost worker productivity and morale and it do the argument that short week affect business resilience or productivity have be use time and again the factories act contain requirement to deal with overcrowding control temperature and introduce ventilation all of which be oppose at the time on the basis of cost as colleague will know the same argument be put forward about the equal pay act it be the same when pay holiday be introduce in people say the minimum wage be go to cost hundred of thousand of job but we all know that it do not paternity and maternity leave be eschew because it be say to damage industry but do it do so no it do not research from barclays show that work hour in the uk have fall by on average in the past four decade with british worker now work more hour on average than their german counterpart worker in france italy and spain have enjoy decline in work hour but despite people in this country work long hour than those in our competitor and partner nation we be one of the least productive country in the and we have to do something about that what about the impact on employer will the hon member give way well do not want to but will maybe be pre empte the answer the hon member be go to give but what exactly be the measure in this bill and the amendment the magic potion that will improve productivity be pleased the hon lady ask that question because it be patently obvious that well working condition lead to less absenteeism more resilience in the workforce and well productivity it be not magic potion but what be know as enlighten employment she may like to read about that and if she want will put she in touch with few people who can talk to she about it in that study mention report reduced level of burnout say it be easy to balance work with household responsibility find they have an increase ability to combine pay work with care responsibility and report that it be easy to combine work with social life and so on and so on as have say the bill seek to put this issue on the agenda because believe it be inevitable history show it that change in pattern of work working arrangement the nature of work and other associate issue such as artificial intelligence will eventually lead to four day week over period of time so let we embrace the change and let we plan for the change if we do want to get the country back to work get the country work productively and get many million of people without work back into work let we do this as progressively as we possibly can finally if we be lengthen the time we ask people to work by an extra year two year or maybe three year in the future if we ask they to have long work life the least we can do be to ask they to have short week what be wrong with that and be it really too much to ask do not think so and many employer and employee take the same view so let we not make an enemy of progress why do we not just embrace it rise to speak to the measure on zero hour contract and opposition new clause and amendment it be absolutely right that we should pause to consider the effect of these change on employment tribunal but it be also right that we should pause to consider their effect just on employment of course there be bad employer and those who would seek to exploit which be very bad thing we should bear down on they but there be no reason to believe that the measure the government be bring forward will achieve that suggest that the government want to get rid of zero hour contract not because intrinsically there be great problem attach to they but because of the special place zero hour contract have in labour mythology want to take we back to the glory day of the modern labour party when the leader of the labour party be the current leader immediate predecessor the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn see the then shadow chancellor the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell be with we in the chamber and as it happen be the minister for employment at the time when our government come to power unemployment have be and it then rise little bit to at the end of from then on it come down and it keep come down by late it be under and it would fall far still however that do not fit labour members narrative they want to be able to say that this reduction in unemployment be not real it be all fake employment or low quality employment that be not true but it do not stop they say it in fact three quarter of the increase in employment be in high skilled occupation and three quarter of the job growth be in full time work at that time employment be grow much more quickly than self employment and the no sector for employment growth be construction however labour members still keep say that the job be create be all low quality one and at the top of the list of thing to call out be the zero hour contract the then leader of the opposition use to talk about it weekly at prime minister question time there be couple of awkward moment such as after his glorious appearance at glastonbury when it turn out that the glastonbury festival guess people on zero hour contract there be far embarrassment when it turn out that there be people work for none other than the labour party conference who be on zero hour contract at the dwp we do some research and it turn out that less than of people rely on zero hour contract for their main employment on average it deliver they hour of work week while strangely they have above average job satisfaction and most be not look for more hour people say the number have grow but it be actually much more likely that that be because of grow awareness of the term zero hour contract think about our history it have long be the case that far more than of people have have irregular income pattern where they have not have guarantee hour of work or level of salary from casual labour to piece work catalogue agent and commission only sale at certain point it dawn on that my own first job have be wash dish on zero hour contract or at least it would have be have contract be involve at all do the right hon member accept that someone choose to take on an irregular contract when they be at the high end of the pay scale with significant professional skill and expectation for the future be very different from the endemic insecurity at the bottom of the labour market which be where zero hour contract be concentrated some of people on zero hour contract order think the hon lady be in fact make her speech rather than an intervention interruption oh her speech will come tomorrow the hon member be right of course those thing be different but with the dawning realisation have back then start to wonder who else might take zero hour contract yes it be true that disproportionately they be young people but for quite lot of people zero hour contract be for second job would be interested to hear from the government their assessment of that it turn out when we look at this in that one of the big user of zero hour contract in the country be none other than the national health service so that it could cope with increase in demand these be people who have permanent job as well but who could as bank staff supply other hour when that be need for this government it be totemic to do something about zero hour contract because of that labour mythology for the union there be also another reason this be classic insider outsider theory with shift in remuneration from people who be not in work to people who be already in work and it push up what be call the non accelerate inflation rate of unemployment in plain english it be bad for job the chancellor of the exchequer must know that because as we all know she be most definitely an economist she have work as an economist she have train as an economist and she be an economist and this be classical economic reality for whom might zero hour contract work well they work well for any employer with an unpredictable variable need for worker from the event business to the nhs as have mention and there be other obvious case in tourism agriculture and food however some people may just choose to have that flexibility over the last two year it have be seller market to go into teaching but some people have still choose to become supply teacher because for whatever reason for they that work well the other group for whom this may work be those furth from the labour market who have perhaps be out of work for very long time who perhaps be ex offender or who for some other reason find it difficult to immediately land regular full time job when this be combine with universal credit which by the way the right hon member for islington north also want to abolish it can work very well because the top up payment can be adjust accord to how much someone earn week to week this bill be bind to have unintended consequence we do not know exactly which one they will be but will suggest some of they it could suppress seasonal peak in employment for tourism in the summer but also at christmas time because employer will not want to take on the liability from the reference period it could deter people from second job which will be bad for growth it could mean people move from contract employment to self employment or casual work it could mean move from permanent contract to temporary contract and yes it could hit our national health service and other important public sector employer do not doubt that this piece of legislation will be good for union but it will be bad for the economy and bad for growth and it will be especially bad for people in the hard circumstance who so badly want to get back to work and for whom this kind of contract can also be that important first step congratulate the deputy prime minister my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner and the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders on all their incredible work in bring forward this landmark piece of legislation pay tribute to the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran who be co sponsor new clause with today this be the first speech have give as back bencher in nearly year one of the few benefit of ahem elevate oneself to the back benches be the ability to speak much more routinely on behalf of my constituent and those without political voice the amendment rise to speak to today be literally about the voiceless those who have be legally silence in the name of organisational and personal preservation new clause would prohibit employer from enter into non disclosure agreement with worker in relation to complaint of sexual misconduct abuse harassment or discrimination it very closely mirror legislation recently pass in ireland that ban nda in those circumstance but allow they at the express consent of the victim and legislation that have be pass in multiple us state in relation to sexual harassment nda have perfectly legitimate use in business to protect commercial confidentiality and trade but they be frequently misuse to bully people into silence when they have already suffer at work we know of the most high profile case from harvey weinstein to mohamed al fayed only because their brave survivor risk breach their nda but these agreement be far from confine to celebrity abuser they be be misuse and exploit on vast scale the campaign can buy my silence lead by zelda perkins who help to expose the abuse of harvey weinstein have also uncover multiple scandal in the high education sector which lead to action by the former government to ban the use of nda in that sector we sadly know that in our own labour movement trade union have be accuse of use confidentiality clause in settlement which have the same chilling effect as nda have be tell story on point of order madam deputy speaker would the right hon lady be kind enough to declare her union interest from her entry in the register of members financial interests believe there be donation order that be not matter for the chair but point for the member be very grateful for that point of order be of course very happy to declare my interest as set out in the register of members financial interests just as be in the process of criticise trade union trade union have be accuse of use confidentiality clause in settlement which have the same chilling effect as nda have be tell story that should be on the front page of newspaper such as the man who be accuse of rape sign an nda and be pay off his alleged victim only find out year later that that have be the case while she be still work in the same workplace medium organisation such as itn have come under recent criticism as former employee daisy ayliffe say woman who work for itn have try to report harassment and discrimination but soon after do so find themselves suddenly out of job and bind by non disclosure agreement another former employee of itn on see daisy speak out realise that his experience be far from unique and ask that use parliamentary privilege today to speak about the confidentiality clause he be require to sign he have ask that do not use his name so will call he mr mr join itn in on scheme call enabling talent which aim to recruit more disabled people into the organisation he suffer from condition call functional neurological disorder which have number of symptom include non epileptic seizure or dissociate seizure which he describe as zone out or blackout in itn make number of reasonable adjustment for he include help with note taking key to the first aid room and disability leave when require in order to avoid stress and fatigue induce seizure he state that at the time he could not fault his employer for the support it give he mr leave itn to pursue his career elsewhere and return in when he again declare his disability and make request for similar adjustment despite multiple request for the kind of help he have receive before none be forthcoming instead he suffer severe bullying and discrimination include pressure to disclose his disability widely to his colleague the situation get so bad that his zone out and blackout become increasingly frequent after suffer one seizure at work he be require to apologise to those who have witness it he be repeatedly accuse of lie about his disability and tell that his issue be nothing to do with his disability despite have join itn on disability inclusion scheme mr take itn to tribunal incur ten of thousand of pound in legal cost he settle but be require to sign confidentiality clause his health have deteriorate so badly that he now use wheelchair of the time and follow the loss of his job he be for period make homeless do my right hon friend agree that in such case there be no public interest and no interest for anyone apart from guilty party to keep these thing secret and that that be why it be important nda be not use to hide problem that employer should sort out be grateful to my hon friend for that intervention he be absolutely right there be many organisation include the bbc that as policy do not use nda imagine suffer that kind of treatment at work lose your job lose your health and then be ban from explain to another potential employer or even your close friend what have happen to you it make it next to impossible to recover from the experience very difficult to find work again and vanishingly unlikely that the organisation will face up to its wrongdoing and enact change for mr for survivor of monster such as mohamed al fayed and for the thousand of victim across our society who have be legally require to suffer in silence hope the house can agree that such agreement have no place in modern society and if it can happen in organisation such as itn whose job be literally to expose injustice or in trade union whose job be to protect worker then it can happen anywhere organisation in these instance no matter who they be will circle the wagon and protect themselves rather than the victim by do so they protect abuser that be why we must simply remove the tool of their abuse and end the use of nda in these circumstance be very grateful to the minister for his early response and for confirm that the issue warrant further consideration but may press he little far on exactly how we can see progress and we must see progress it be sicken that across the country woman and man will have suffer abuse in their workplace and that instead of action against the perpetrator they be the one who be sham and silence gang up on by lawyer and sentence to lifetime of regret as member of the public bill committee for the bill be surprise by the number of amendment the government table to their own legislation in committee there be hundred of amendment demonstrate how badly the bill be draft when it be first propose it be clearly bad idea to commit to introduce such major piece of legislation within day of the election but guess that be the price of trade union money to fund the labour party have have sitting in committee scrutinise the bill line by line we now find ourselves with another vast number of government amendment once again but this time with only two day to scrutinise it most of the amendment on the amendment paper be the government the amendment paper be thick than the original bill this be bad bill it push up the cost of labour make our flexible labour market less flexible and will increase unemployment be pleased to have table new clause which would add special constable to the scope of section of the employment rights act give they the right to unpaid leave to perform their duty special constable be volunteer who give their time at no cost to the taxpayer to help our police force special have exist in some form ever since the special constables act which allow justice of the peace to conscript volunteer to combat riot and social unrest the special constabulary as we know it be establish by the police act which give chief constable the authority to appoint and manage special constable today special carry all the same legal power as their full time counterpart both on and off duty and put themselves in harm way without payment to keep our society safe today the special constabulary an institution that have serve this nation for nearly two century face crisis the number of volunteer officer have fall by two third in the past decade in the past year alone we have see drop many police force now face significant gap in their special constabulary rank this be not just temporary dip but long term trend there be multiple factor at play but clearly become special be not an attractive proposition to too many potential recruit believe we must act now to ensure that the special constabulary continue to play vital role in police for generation to come it be in that context that bring forward my amendment to the bill which seek to amend section of the employment rights act for those who be not aware section allow those undertake number of community role to request unpaid time off work to perform their duty on the list be magistrate local councillor school governor and even member of the environment agency it seem strange to that we would exclude those prepared to keep we safe from the list of community minded citizen of course some employer be understand and already try to support officer on their staff when the association of special constabulary officers write to the minister call for he to back these change he respond that the employer supported policing scheme be be promote to increase the number of special but this be simply not enough survey complete by asco last year show that more than of special be not support by their employer and it be currently lawful for employer to refuse time off for special the riot last summer demonstrate the benefit of have flexible police force give the government focus on promote neighbourhood and community police increase the number of special seem like good choice this measure will not cost the taxpayer penny it simply put special constable on the same footing as other volunteer this new clause have the support of right hon and hon member from almost every party represent in this house and have be endorse by police and crime commissioner importantly assistant chief constable bill dutton act in his capacity as the national police chiefs council lead for the special constabulary have provide his write support for include special constable under section believe that this new clause would help the recruitment and retention of many new special constable and make our street safe it would also finally recognise the work of the special and put they on the same footing as the thousand of other people in the country who be allow time off work to complete valuable civic duty it be in that spirit that ask the minister to seriously consider whether the government will accept new clause refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my union membership the legislation before we today be truly historic it be totemic in scale the big upgrade to worker right in generation commend the minister and the team for the work they have do the bill deliver not only for work family but for the whole country it will lead to high productivity high wage and ultimately economic growth these reform be unashamedly pro worker and pro business in sharp contrast with the past year when we see low pay low productivity and low growth in the economy shockingly productivity grow by just year between and since we have see insecure work rise nearly three time as fast as secure work whether it be the worker who be sack over zoom without notice the retail worker whose shift get cancel last minute and now can not afford their weekly food shop or the million people one in three worker in this country not protect from unfair dismissal it can not go on will talk briefly about some of the measure in the bill day one right will provide serious boost for million of people nine million worker have less than two year service with their employer and thus do not enjoy protection from unfair dismissal would welcome some clarity around the initial period of employment what specific timeframe would the measure apply to and what exactly do it mean moreover urge the government to look at what support be available for small firm that be concerned about the impact that the measure may have on their cost can we consider what more can be do to guide company through these change zero hour contract be endemic across our economy so many people with those contract be give very little notice when their work be cancel in some case they may have already sort out their childcare or make travel arrangement let turn briefly to industrial relation an important element of the legislation be set the new framework for industrial relation the business and trade committee hear from many good employer such as jaguar land rover and british aerospace that work with the union to create the right employment practice across their business by contrast we also witness the mistreatment of worker and the denial of their basic right at amazon which clearly have problem in the workplace the propose fair work agency which be welcome by union and progressive business alike be positive move as we hear in the business and trade committee the agency need to be adequately resource because it be so important shall turn to some of the amendment that support we just hear from my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh about new clause one constituent of mine mrs be the victim of harassment in the workplace she be victim to particular individual who be protect by the management ultimately she have to leave the organisation he then also have to leave himself harassment be such problem in the workplace and it be something that must be address in this legislation new clause relate to modern slavery the select committee hear about the problem of shein and how company in the uk have be disadvantage by the practice of business that operate elsewhere wish to talk bit more about productivity and the point that raise with the shadow minister the legislation be important because it bring not only great benefit to worker but even great responsibility for employer tight employment legislation lead to great productivity as we see in france and germany both country have see advantage in their productivity compare with that of the uk this be why we have see such stagnant economy in the uk over the past year this legislation be another reminder to the people of this country that only the labour party can deliver for working family it will mean less uncertainty at work less insecurity at work and more money in people pocket urge the government to look at the fair work agency and particularly at the definition of reasonable notice move and short notice and to provide clarity on how many week the initial and subsequent reference period should be this be colossal piece of legislation that be so important in this decade it bring about real change which be what this party will deliver for work people thereby boost productivity and ultimately grow the economy rise to speak to new clause which appear in the name of the right hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh pay tribute to she and say that the back benches be very lucky to have she may also pay tribute to mr whose story she tell so movingly the campaign to redress the power imbalance for those offer non disclosure agreement in case of sexual harassment harassment bullying and discrimination have be many year in the making it transcend organisation and it transcend party pay tribute to member past and present of all colour who have be part of this campaign for so long be pleased to hear from the minister from the dispatch box that he hop to continue to make progress but hope to urge he to go far fast and for very good reason it be long past time that this practice just stop want to reveal another never before tell story from itn it be never before reveal because it be cover by non disclosure agreement which mean that will be use privilege to reveal the detail before begin it be worth say that the victim be not alone understand that there be seven out there from itn we have hear another one today and that investigation have be do by itn board which be intent on change this victim be clear that she do not want to cause itn problem but she want mp to understand the effect that this continue to have on her life and why we need to act quickly this young woman be in her when she land her dream job at itn she quickly become trap in what we understand to be coercive control sexual relationship with an old male editor he would hurl wild accusation at she and accuse she of affair with colleague she end up suffer from panic attack as result of the relationship before christmas she finally have the courage to end it when she return to work in january she have be demote her hour be reduce and so be her pay the first editor she tell warn she to stay silent she say you do want to be one of those woman who always moan about be wrong she then confide in more senior editor and thing get bad she tell she it not like he ever hit you it not like you ever have to go to with broken bone she go to work every day for the next year it take itn month to agree to an hr investigation into what happen it agree only on the condition that she would also be investigate hr find that it could not assess the complaint because it be criminal in nature but at the same time find it to be unfounded that make no sense around this time she ask question at an itn woman empowerment forum in front of all staff during the pandemic she simply ask what support be there for woman who report allege sexual harassment in the workplace within an hour her email have be cut off hr summon she to an urgent meeting her primary offence it would seem be ask for help from that moment she be suspend without pay she have be completely cut off from almost all support network for about year itn tell she that she be not allow to tell anyone except the police to be fair what be happen even her good friend have to sign an nda to attend meeting to support she the nhs offer her group therapy for her anxiety but she feel that she have to decline because the organisation insist that she stay silent her lawyer say that the organisation be try to starve she out in negotiation over her exit they take year by the time they get to settlement she have rack up in legal fee know from experience that it be practice of employment lawyer who work for employer to go on to google maps and look at the house in which complainant live to assess the asset that they be likely to have and whether they be likely to be able to afford to continue their defence to tribunal or whether they could be offer small amount as settlement do the hon lady agree that nda be provide cover for that absolutely this be exactly the kind of behaviour that we need to put stop to the young woman eventually reach settlement but it be extremely one sided she panic because the nda gag not just she but her partner her good friend and her parent but it do not gag the man or the senior executive involve in the harassment that she face it cover not just business matter we be not seek to stop confidentiality agreement on business matter but everything painful that she have endure her mental health spiral and she end up in hospital every day that she be in hospital bed the lawyer send her automatic reminder to sign her nda this be woman at she most vulnerable it be entirely wrong that she be put in that position it be worth say that almost none of that nda be enforceable it if be take to court it would fail the victims and prisoners act make it clear that she should have be able to get that support we be kid ourselves if we think that nda be not still be use and issue they be that be why this bill whether now in the lords or wherever need to put stop to it many year on follow an investigation into the treatment of these worker at itn the woman do believe that the organisation be try to change and she be grateful to the executive from within who be push for reform the late update be that itn be willing to renegotiate her nda that be laudable but she should never have be put under one in the first place and those protection should be everywhere we face weird situation which we in the house have create in the higher education freedom of speech act there be provision it be table as an amendment by labour and take on in the lords by the then conservative government that say that such non disclosure agreement be not allow but it cover only high education setting because that be the scope of the act be an oxford mp how do it make any sense at all that might have constituent who be protect from such non disclosure agreement if they work for the university but not if they work for any of the university spin out the hon member be make powerful speech pay tribute to the people who have share their experience do she agree that the people we be talk about have mean and support network and that without these protection the most vulnerable in society will be affect which be why get the law right be so important thank the hon member very much these people be indeed incredibly brave what we be try to show be that it happen to man and woman it be discrimination it be sexual harassment and it be ubiquitous it be happen everywhere and it be happen now we be not seek to silence people in fact new clause say that if victim want an nda for whatever reason they would be allow one the new clause simply seek to redress the gap how can it be right that sometime soon in some establishment worker will be protect and that in other they will not it be time for the government to sort this out the new clause do not say exactly how they should do that but that the protection afford to all worker anywhere should be the same as those afford in university it would give the government six month from the bill enactment to sort it out which should be plenty of time arguably they should be able to tackle this with something in the lords which would give they bit of extra time urge the minister not to wait for some other bill or some other time welcome the meaningful word that we have hear from the dispatch box however also urge he to look back appreciate that that be not to this government but another one because we have hear this before the campaign have transcend party and transcend year it have transcend parliaments we be make slow progress meanwhile victim continue to be hurt day after day every day that these nda often make in perpetuity endure that hurt and trauma continue please let this be the government who put the abuse of non disclosure agreement where they belong in the trash can so that we finally afford the protection that we be about to give to all university worker to every single employee as per my entry in the register of members financial interests be member of gmb my union membership have give reassurance for many year that have back if need it be conscious that although in this place we may be listen to when we speak up for too many people insecurity and lack of respect at work be an everyday experience business suffer under the failure of the previous government to act when reform be need that be not in this area alone of course but today we be speak about the relevant amendment we can come back to their other failing another day or perhaps on more than one other day because this be the time for action and we be the party of business everyone should have contract that reflect the hour that they work there be place for flexibility but people need to sort out transport and childcare and plan their household budget so we will ensure that agency and low or zero hour contract work for both side for business and worker for too long zero hour contract have often be at the expense of people who be just try to make living for themselves and their family we will put stop to that day work deserve fair day pay and give the fair work agency the power to bring civil proceeding and issue penalty be an important move the vast majority of employer respect the right of the people who work for they and have nothing to fear from that in fact they will welcome the levelling of the play field as they tell we all the time their good practice must not be undermine by the unscrupulous minority we also say that everyone should be free from harassment when they be at their place of work the message that conservative members send when they object to that protection to among other the many thousand of young woman who have be harass at work be appal in contrast we believe that everyone deserve respect at work whatever the industry they work in want to reassure among other worker in the hospitality and retail industry that they matter they deserve well and we be on their side far when issue happen it be to everyone benefit to resolve they quickly we will fast track decision making and back that up with robust fine that help business and worker and it minimise stress cost and delay be pleased that the bill be welcome by many of our lead employer include centrica as already mention know centrica well it have training academy in my constituency its chief executive chris be fully supportive of the legislation as not just the right thing to do but as foundation for high growth high skill economy and the progress that our country need stable workforce will help both employer and worker the chaos of repeat strike have damage business and service and leave our country reel the conservative party may be instinctively oppose to empower ordinary people but on the labour benches we say that these be the people who keep our country go and they have the full support of this government rise to speak to new clause and to other new clause and amendment in my name last year the labour party commit to strengthen statutory sick pay remove the low earning limit to make it available to all worker and remove the wait period although the removal of the low earning limit and the wait period be welcome the fact remain that the uk statutory sick pay do not meet the need of work people the miserly increase to the rate it have just be increase by after five year be far from the transformative change that labour promise and will not help to deliver healthy population and grow economy indeed only few year ago during the covid period the minister note that the then health secretary have admit that he could not live on statutory sick report first delegated legislation committee delegated legislation committee january to be clear the uk be lag behind in its provision of ssp offer one of the least generous system in the oecd while the labour government propose rate of week or of average weekly earning whichever be low numerous other european country such as austria germany iceland and luxembourg either provide full salary payment or cover portion of earning range from to amendment would bring the uk into close alignment with other oecd country with limited coverage and relatively low rate many worker and particularly low income and part time employee be leave without sufficient financial support when they fall ill such gap in sick pay provision impact worker wellbee exacerbate financial stress during illness and can discourage people from take the necessary time off to recover it contribute to poor health outcome undermine long healthy working life across the uk population surely no one in this house want that to continue the joseph rowntree foundation state that the most effective way of strengthen sick pay be by increase the rate there be numerous amendment that would do that include new clause in my name which would gradually increase the rate of statutory sick pay over the next five year take it to at least of the rate of the national living wage and other that propose ssp to be the high of prescribed rate or percentage of usual weekly earning moreover report by wpi economics show that sick pay reform could result in net financial benefit to this country of more than billion it also find that the positive effect of sick pay reform would particularly help the increase proportion of the british workforce who manage long term condition and ensure that few worker fall out of the job market entirely as an example many people with multiple sclerosis need to take time off work for vary length of time for reason relate to their condition some people with ms be well support by their employer through occupational sick pay of course we support that and can take the time off work that they need on full pay when people with ms can get the financial support they need while they be off work they can often stay in work for long as they can well manage their symptom in the long term this need to be the same for all those with ms and other long term condition who rely on ssp new clause would require the secretary of state to consider such change with the aim of properly reform this outdated and inflexible system change for those with such condition could include ssp be pay at an hourly rate rather than daily rate to enable people to work half or part day on gradual phase return to work or change the restriction on how people can claim and use ssp so that it be fair for people with fluctuate condition by extend eligibility timeframe sadly however suspect that the labour party be look to slash welfare spending as have be report disabled people be push into poverty will be no joy to many and that it have little interest in make such supportive and progressive change look forward to hear from the minister the labour government lack of gumption in their approach to ssp be illustrative of the timidity of their approach in this employment rights bill yes the bill make improvement to the right of work people and yes it reverse some of the bad excess of the tory government but it could have do so much more where be the straightforward system define single status of worker to replace the maze of confusing classification design to limit protection that continue to exist where be the increase provision for collective bargaining to alleviate low pay where have the promise disappear to of the right to switch off which would ensure well work life balance this be the opportunity to legislate to entrench employment right and to ensure fair deal for worker and healthy more equitable and more productive economy and society unfortunately this bill be leave want hope that if the labour party be serious about its manifesto commitment the minister will look at these new clause and amendment welcome the report stage of this bill proudly declare my membership of unite and the communication workers union and refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests this bill will see the big upgrade to worker right for generation it be an agenda for change change that be desperately need working class people keep this country care for they keep our street clean our shelf stack and our public service run but the imbalance of power in our workplace be plain to see the scandal be testament to that this bill represent crucial first step in redress that imbalance especially amendment on sick pay it strengthen both collective and individual right and put more money in the pocket of work people therefore welcome the government amendment to the bill ensure that everyone get sick pay from the first day they be ill include those previously exclude for earn too little currently around million worker be exclude from statutory sick pay altogether and the present three day wait be extremely hard for those on low pay who often budget on week to week basis and my husband be those people who live week to week and drag ourselves into work when we be not well because if we do not work we do not eat when my child be small the fact that the bill rectify that be extremely welcome the pandemic expose just how inadequate current level of sick pay be therefore urge the government to ensure that as many worker as possible benefit from the measure in the bill in particular they should look at what they can do to increase the rate of statutory sick pay over time as we currently have one of the low rate of sick pay across the develop country hope the government continue to consider the impact of the removal of the low earning limit to ensure that everybody benefit from the measure in this bill overall these change will be transformative for work people in my constituency as work class woman from council estate it do my heart good to be able to stand in this place support change that will make the life of work people well and give they the reward they so deserve pay tribute to all the members who serve on the bill committee for its session their job be make hard by the fact that this be rush legislation bring forward purely to spare the blush of the deputy prime minister who make promise to the trade union baron who fund her party as result we see the large number of amendment that we be discuss today it be also the case that while the government have consult during the passage of the bill they do not appear to have listen to employer very much hon member should beware the unintended consequence of these measure and the bill turn to the amendment give that the government apparent priority be growth new clause be an essential addition many of the power in the bill will be implement through regulation which clearly the house employer and employee do not have any detail of the approach again show the rush nature of the legislation commonly throughout the passage of other bills the regulation would be pass in draft while the clause implement they be consider that have not happen in this case so it be therefore wholly sensible to require that when make regulation ministers must have regard to the international competitiveness of the economy as hon member know the government inherit the fast grow economy in the but since then what have happen their action and word have stop growth stone dead as well as competitiveness it be essential that the government take into account economic growth in the medium and long term my concern be that the government be treat business like the mule in buckaroo load on more and more cost and obligation anyone who have play the game will know that it be inevitable that there will be reaction and the mule will buck in economic term that mean few job high price and low wage the government own impact assessment put the cost to business at billion year that simply can not be absorb by company so new clause would offer some protection many hon member have speak about the extension of employment provision to day one and recognise that the extension of unfair dismissal be well intentione however the reality be that that increase the risk to employer of take people on the federation of small businesses have say that the increase risk will inevitably deter small employer from take on new people for fear of face an employment tribunal simply because new recruit turn out to be unsuited to the role that be bad for people job investment and growth new clause would require the secretary of state to assess the impact of extend the provision in clause with parliament have to approve they this parliamentary lock be about protect the chance that young people ex offender and people from other vulnerable group have to join the workforce as otherwise firm might simply not take chance on they part time work will be particularly hit by the bill those measure be on top of the government billion year job tax which be make job in the hospitality sector subject to employer national insurance for the first time billion cost for that sector those be the very type of flexible role that be well suited as be mention early to people on long term sickness benefit who might be look to move back into the workplace and the bill undermine all of that the third area want to focus on be flexible working and the provision on guarantee hour include new clause table by the government again it be worth listen to business leader who have warn about the unintended consequence the chief executive of currys for example have say that guarantee hour measure will penalise young worker and million of other who benefit from flexible hour make such job less viable and business less competitive we do not need to be retailer or even an economist or lawyer to know that store and leisure and hospitality business have season that be particularly the case in my constituency company have to plan to have the right size workforce at different time of the year and these measure will damage that it appear to be quite commonly overlook by opposition members that flexible working will still be available to people on fix term contract do the hon member agree that such contract can be use to manage seasonal fluctuation be simply point to the word of the chief executive of currys which employ thousand of people across the country be not here to tell employer what form of contract to offer their staff and be not sure that it be the hon lady job to do so either however the bill will certainly remove flexibility the government be double down by extend that requirement to agency worker flexible contract which be value by staff we have hear from other conservative members about their benefit will be undermine by the bill flexible labour market be an important part of secure grow economy the previous government manage to achieve that while also extend employment right as the federation of small businesses and organisation that provide million of job have warn the clear danger of the bill be that it will make it hard to employ people by increase risk and cost rather than strike the balance that the shadow minister my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith speak about the government have produce measure that when take together and on top of the chancellor tax raise budget and the near doubling of business rate for hospitality retail and leisure business create significant cost and regulatory risk that be why we oppose the bill and the government action to hike taxis and increase regulation that will make we less competitive draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my trade union membership for far too long our economy have be stick in low growth low wage low aspiration situation for far too long we have allow some of the good employer and business in the country to be undercut by more unscrupulous employer that as they be unable to compete through competitive advantage or productivity do so only by level down working condition that simply can not be right we have hear in committee in the house and in headline over many year some heartbreaking example of the bad scandal that that have enable truthfully there be not person in our society who be not lose out as result of our failure to tackle this issue opposition members have comment on the pace at which the government be move on that issue we would not have to move at such pace if they have do more wonder whether my hon friend agree with julie abraham the ceo of richer sounds who say happy colleague be likely to be more productive this also lead to reduce stock loss and high staff retention which in turn minimise recruitment and training cost not to mention disruption to establish team could not have put it well myself research be clear about the strong link between good working condition and good productivity and the wide economic benefit that they bring that be why be grateful to everyone who have play their part include the minister and member of the bill committee have sympathy for those who have to endure some of the trope that we have hear today in ensure that we have such big and comprehensive package before we today we be debate some strong amendment today will focus on new clause in particular as it affect constituent who come to my surgery recently the literature on the harm of zero hour contract their impact not just on productivity but on poverty and on worker condition health and mental health be compelling but if we do not acknowledge the human impact we miss half the story at my constituency surgery two week ago be join by gentleman who have be work for four year on zero hour contract at royal mail for four year he have not know what hour he would be work week to week month to month year to year for four year he have not be able to plan his daily life his other commitment and the further education that he be try to do to build out his skill and well himself for four year his life have be narrow by the precarious reality of the exploitative application of zero hour contract by those who should haven know well for that reason be so glad that the government commit in our manifesto and in the bill which be introduce some time ago now to take on zero hour contract and give people the right where appropriate to request fix hour contract however without new clause my constituent would have be miss out because although he work at royal mail he be employ through an agency without the extension of protection in the new clause he would like many other across the country have lose out be very glad that we be be complete in our approach and ensure that we do not miss out from that important protection the very many employee who be currently work for agency there be lot of other important amendment to the bill be glad to hear such warm word from the minister in his opening remark about the very important amendment table by my bedfordshire neighbour my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen it be impossible to hear her testimony about bereavement or to speak to parent who have go through bereavement and not recognise the simple reality that to be bereave be not to be sick and that our leave system should recognise it as such be very glad to hear from the minister that the government will work with my hon friend and other across the house who have campaign on this issue for long time to ensure we recognise that reality there be number of important measure in the bill can do justice to very few of they in three minute so want to focus on just one clause which be about ensure we remove some of the barrier to new dad take up paternity leave early on in their employment it be well recognise fact that we have some of the bad paternity leave entitlement across europe although share parental leave sound great as concept we do not have to look far to notice that its uptake be shockingly low and shockingly skewed to the high earner be glad that we be take small but important step in the bill to recognise that we need to do more to boost access to paternity leave the government will be conduct review of parental leave later this year and know that member across the house will be keen to engage with the minister on how we can go far not just in allow father to have that crucial early time with their child but in break down the very gendered nature of parenting which be currently bake into our statutory provision on parental leave there be so many important measure in the bill and so many important area where we know we will need to go far fundamentally be full of pride to see government finally after inaction by the conservatives for far too long take seriously the issue of workplace security productivity and the wellbeing of people across the country in some of the most vulnerable form of employment be proud that this government be stand up for my constituent and many people like he across the country and be proud to support the bill today in the last year have work in business of every size in numerous sector from consumer good to cyber security and insurance to cloud infrastructure may not be lawyer but feel well qualified to comment on this bill the government need not take it from if only they have listen to the business have speak to be vice chair of the business and trade committee and my fellow committee member and have spend many hour listen to evidence on the bill from employer trade union and industry group our select committee tour the country at the end of last year collate evidence and hearing from wide range of sector in my coastal constituency of bognor regis and littlehampton have speak to numerous business many of which be impact by the vagary of seasonal trade and inclement british weather consistent message emerge from business at least if not from the trade union how can government who claim their primary focus be deliver growth be so tin eare to the view and need of the very business entrepreneur and employee who be fundamental to create that growth the government have boast of deliver this bill which be telephone directory thick within their first day this be not sensible governance indeed the telephone directory of amendment be testament to that one of the most damaging provision be the abolition of the two year qualifying period for unfair dismissal under clause allow employee to question fail probation or trial period in their contract from day one employee will be able to take their employer to court our conservative amendment seek to remove this clause entirely because it will disincentivise business from hire as they will know they can not let an employee go even if it be not work out the government expect entrepreneur and business to take the risk necessary to drive growth indeed that be what they expect and want to do but clause add unnecessary risk and be likely to be to the detriment of jobseeker it will far marginalise those who would already be consider risky candidate the hon member and both serve on the business and trade committee the statistic show that the vast majority of young people do not have two year service and therefore have no protection from us style fire at will policy in hospitality and catering which be industry that the hon member have massive concern about vast number have no protection from fire at will overnight firing for no reason and with no process and the bill will outlaw that know that she support fair process and fair reason for firing so hope that she will support the bill today the hon member know that will always support fair process but the point be make be that this clause will make it more difficult for employer to take on prison leaver care leaver candidate with non traditional cv career changer and young people who be just look for that first rung on the job ladder those people will not be give fair chance as employer will see they as too risky and hope she will see the risk inherent in the clause my hon friend be make powerful point use to be an employer be an entrepreneur for about year and we employ more than people do she agree that exactly those people who be bit of risk because they have something not quite right on their cv and be high risk hire be the people who will not get job as result of the bill thank my hon friend for make that powerful point anyone who have ever look for job member in the chamber will probably count themselves as be among the well qualified of the population look for work will know that most employer of any kind do not want to take risk if we make it even hard for they to employ people who be risk at base point it will not serve their purpose the government own impact assessment suggest that the direct effect of the bill will cost uk business an additional billion annually that estimate most likely understate the true cost as it account only for administrative burden while ignore the broad impact on hire business cost and strike action key factor such as reduce hiring due to zero hour contract limit increase strike activity and great liability from employment tribunal claim as outline in the bill be dismiss as too hard to calculate make those assessment highly questionable that be why support new clause which would require an impact assessment to be carry out for the measure in clause we table new clause and amendment to ensure that the bill provision on zero hour worker would not come into force until comprehensive review of the bill impact on employment tribunal have be assess and approve by parliament clause place new duty on employer to prevent third party harassment protect employee be unquestionably important and no one should doubt the sincerity of conservative members about that do the hon member agree as do that it be right that million low earner who find themselves ill should receive statutory sick pay for the first time like she represent coastal seat with tourist sector and as consequence my constituency have significant number of low earner do she agree that we need to be back they refer the hon member first to my early comment about ensure that we do not disincentivise employer and secondly to the flexibility that be need for both employer and employee amendment seek to exclude hospitality provider and sport venue from those provision recognise the impracticality of hold employer accountable for every interaction in those environment it be simply not practical to think that every publican landlord and bar owner small business owner would be liable for any harassment that happen towards their employee in pub bar nightclub or festival amendment would require an impact assessment to be carry out on clause of course business and business owner should embed good working practice and guideline to combat this abhorrent behaviour but it be impractical and undesirable for the government to legislate nationally for every sector and business the hon lady will appreciate that there be defence here if an employer have take all reasonable step it be only reasonable step be sorry think we have make enough progress urge the government to reconsider to withdraw the bill and to work with business union and worker to create fair and balanced approach that prioritise the political interest order call lee barron refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests have say it before and will say it again due to the virtue of my last name be the only legitimate union barron in this place and be absolutely proud of it it be an honour to speak on this bill again and commend this government for bring it forward we make commitment to work people before the election and we be follow that through welcome the government new clause on agency worker in corby we have more employment agency than any other town in northamptonshire we now see that those who work in agency job will receive fair treatment in pay working hour and job security which be to be welcome as we aim to create well local economy for the people of corby and east northants my hon friend be make powerful speech he and be constituency neighbour as he will know there have be lot of growth in northamptonshire and increase distribution in the area so the government new clause will make massive difference to our constituent it will indeed thank my hon friend for make that point so well this bill have be huge move in term of sick pay as far as the government be concerned it will bring million people into get sick pay for the first time and we need to welcome that we might need to have look at some point in the future to see if there have be drag downwards in term of the people around the low earning limit but we should certainly welcome this as step in the right direction this be not just about legislation we must change the job market and the perception of work that some people have in modern britain there be still some people who do not recognise the value that work people bring have meeting last week with the parcel delivery company evri which operate in all our constituency it describe the employer employee relationship as master servant relationship turn around and say that that kind of view of work people be absolutely date evri say that if it change the status of its worker it would want its pound of word not mine while we have those who treat and describe work people in such way we must bring in legislation to ensure that they can not treat people like that work people be not servant and they should be treat with the dignity and respect that they deserve that be fundamentally wrong crass and outdated way to view employment in modern britain and as long as there be still those who think like that we need to ensure that we change thing for the well and this bill go long way towards do that the question often ask myself be this why do those who want economic growth think that we make growth happen through insecure work minimal wage rate and zero hour contract under which people do not know what they will earn in order to support their family from one week to the next work should not mean lifetime trap in poverty it should be the route out of poverty and this bill be step in the right direction to ensure that be what it become once again chair the all party parliamentary group on modernise employment and at our last meeting we hear from zelda perkins of the ca buy my silence campaign about non disclosure agreement her testimony make it absolutely clear that more need to be do in that space and if there be room to do so through this bill urge the government to accept the amendment that be describe early the appg look to the future of work and what good employment look like at the end of the month the appg be go to look at good work the new deal and this bill we will look at the full effect of this bill to see how we can take forward its benefit and transfer they into the modern world of work in the century modern employment should look like security of work well pay and with progression opportunity in order to keep family out of poverty this bill go some way towards do that in conclusion urge all member to support this bill which ban exploitative zero hour contract say that this will somehow stop flexible working be for the bird it be not the case we have flexible working long before we have zero hour contract we survive then we can survive now and we will survive into the future will the hon gentleman give way no zero hour contract be ban in spain and in the republic of ireland employer can not use they do not tell that those country do not have flexibility they have we will survive in the future as we survive in the past without exploit work people because country do not grow their economy by exploit work people this bill go some way towards stop that the bill ban exploitative zero hour contract increase protection from sexual harassment introduce equality menopause action plan strengthen right for pregnant worker make flexible work the default strengthen bereavement leave improve pay and condition through fair pay agreement provide day one protection against unfair dismissal and establish the fair work agency to make sure all employer be play by the same rule the bill will deliver the job for the future that will benefit work people in corby and east northamptonshire and be proud to support it will focus first on new clause table by the opposition the hon member for hamilton and clyde valley imogen walker who think be just catch before she leave the chamber say that fair day work deserve fair day pay the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne also say that we all agree that an honest day work deserve an honest day pay lot of today speech have be focus on ban zero hour contract and the argument have be make that people deserve to know what their contract be what they be go to be pay and that they be go to be treat properly one of the reason think this bill be rush and be fall down go back to question put to the secretary of state when this bill begin its passage through the house why do it not cover unpaid internship look at this bill and with today debate have focus so much on zero hour contract find it difficult to understand why we would leave whole section of society out of the bill people who can work for up to month without any pay ban unpaid internship have be in labour manifesto after labour manifesto in every parliament have be member of have table bill to ban those internship my government do not want to do it despite prime ministers make promise at the dispatch box when first raise the issue but there be member on the government benches who stand on manifesto that say they would ban unpaid internship now we have this great bill which be trail in the general election and be be promote by the labour party yet there be nothing in it about unpaid internship when the bill go to the other place that have to be look at because such internship be wrong we have hear great deal today about opportunity for people but what opportunity be there for people such as my sister and who have to work and earn living to be able to do what we have go on to do we could not have spend month work in london unpaid the fact that whole section of society can go unpaid be still not be address and that fundamentally undermine what be hear from labour members about what the bill will do to create equality think that be wrong the review of the impact on employment tribunal that be propose in new clause need to be wide and it need to be understand that if the aim be to create equality it be not in fact be create let return to point that make to the minister at the beginning of the debate be grateful for the answer that he give then the bill contain clause about parental leave and bereavement leave pay tribute to the hon member for luton north sarah owen for her dedication to this subject it be very brave of she to bring her own experience to the house but it do not deal with all the aspect of menstrual health and think that that will need to be address in the other place endometriosis be crippling disease as say in my intervention and last thursday be proud to host an event at which it be discuss do not think people realise just how debilitate it can be for people in the workplace and it deserve the same attention as any other aspect of menstrual health strategy like the menopause strategy for instance this constitute big hole in the bill be try to take what the government want to do at face value but think the bill contain many flaw which have be identify by my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith and several other conservative members there be significant gap the right hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh among other refer to non disclosure agreement and think that what she say illustrate some of the flaw in the provision relate to psychological and emotional abuse she give the example of an incident involve someone who have be suffer at work and be make to apologise to the colleague who have witness the incident and think that that should be dig into bit why would that person have to apologise the colleague must have complain that the incident have be distress for they the word psychological and emotional abuse could have unforeseen consequence although that be not to say that do not care the hon member for corby and east northamptonshire lee barron say many thing with which could agree but ask members please not to say that the conservatives do not care about abuse in the workplace do my right hon friend think that some of the problem that he be identify be result of the bill be rush through this chamber do and be try to make serious point here this be big bill and it be one of the government flagship piece of policy hear someone say early from sedentary position that we have hour of debate but that do not come up to the day that we spend in committee examine the bill bit by bit agree with other member that it have be rush through for political purpose the purpose of debate such as this be to explore the issue and try to make bill into well piece of legislation be try to be constructive in explain where see the flaw and in highlight the unforeseen consequence it worry when we see the no platforming of people at university and hear about trigger warning and people say that they feel emotionally put upon that think be an abuse of some of the protection that we be try to introduce and think there be people who will try to abuse this particular clause what be say to the minister and the government be can that wording be tighten up it be always pleasure to follow my constituency neighbour from the other side of the house the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke really welcome the bill which need to be put in its historical context with the exception of those pass under the last labour government virtually every time we have see an employment right bill or trade union bill in recent decade it have be an attack on trade union right or worker right whereas this bill make real difference in advance the right of work people in this country they have be kick around for too long and it be right that we do not accept that it be fine for worker in this country to be some of the easy to sack and mistreat in the continent worker in our country deserve well employment right and this bill set about put they in place my hon friend will have hear constantly particularly in response to the disaster that the conservatives be go to introduce an employment bill when they be in government do my hon friend agree that they have criticise this government for do what they promise to bring in this bill within day certainly do the previous government never get round to introduce such bill when the conservative party be in government all we have about the debacle be crocodile tear or statement of sorrow from the dispatch box which just do not cut it this bill contain important advance such as establish bereavement leave and introduce menopause action plan over million people on zero hour contract will benefit from the guarantee hour policy and million people who have be with an employer for less than two year will benefit from the right to claim unfair dismissal from day one it seem to escape the understanding of many conservative members that this do not mean that employer can not dismiss people it mean that they can not dismiss people unfairly the conservatives be argue for the right of employer to dismiss people unfairly as it stand before this legislation come in the only way that worker can claim unfair dismissal from day one be if it be discriminatory dismissal to be clear an employer could six month into someone contract of employment say sack you because do like people who wear green jumper or sack you because find your voice irritate that would be unfair dismissal as it stand people do not have the right not to be unfairly dismiss until they have accrue two year of service and the conservative party need to come clean about that before move on to my new clause want to say that welcome many of the government amendment and the amendment table by labour back benchers include the many important amendment table by my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald who do such good job at develop employment policy in opposition the important amendment on sick pay table by my hon friend the member for bradford east imran hussain and the important amendment table by my hon friend the members for walthamstow ms creasy and for luton north sarah owen my new clause would right what consider to be historical wrong the last labour government bring in the groundbreaking equality act which we can all be proud of as part of that they introduce statutory discrimination questionnaire when be an employment lawyer before become member of parliament lose track of the number of time that we use statutory discrimination questionnaire to smoke out discrimination in the workplace in relation to age disability sex race sexual orientation pregnancy and maternity gender reassignment religion or belief and marriage and civil partnership bump into an old colleague who be trade union lawyer on train and he make the point that statutory discrimination questionnaire make no apology for have friend who be trade union lawyer think the conservatives need to get out bit more he make the point that statutory discrimination questionnaire show when claim do not have good chance of succeed at an employment tribunal help to manage potential claimant expectation and thus lead to an unmeritorious claim either not be pursue or be settle such questionnaire help to smoke out discrimination in workplace help not just the individual employee but tackle discrimination against worker more widely in that workplace the truth be that in give some of the rhetoric from politician in this country and around the world it be as important as ever to have mechanism in place to tackle discrimination in workplace across the country that be part of the last labour government pioneer equality act shamefully the conservative government abolish statutory equality act questionnaire in as part of their attack on worker right in their consultation of respondent say it be wrong to remove this important mechanism for worker to unmask and tackle the conservative party when in government aid and abet by some of their erstwhile friend plough ahead in any event table new clause because this be an important opportunity for our new labour government to right the wrong do by that conservative lead government and reinstate very important advance make in the last labour government equality act look forward with interest to hear the minister response if he will not accept this amendment to the bill invite he to come forward with proposal to reintroduce statutory discrimination questionnaire as soon as possible they make real difference they help to stop some claim go to tribunal that should not have go to tribunal but more importantly they empower worker to smoke out discrimination in their workplace not only for their benefit but for the benefit of their colleague in that workplace and for the benefit of wide society we need that now in and look forward to the minister response great many very important employment relate issue be be discuss but rise in support of new clause as it stand self employ people be not entitle to statutory adoption pay which create substantial economic barrier for prospective adopter without this support the selfless act of adoption be be make hard new clause would fix that constituent of mine kirsty be self employ mother who discover this significant gap in the financial support system while explore the possibility of adoption kirsty and her husband have son charlie who be bright eyed four year old with an unshakeable love of train he often talk about how much he want little sibling to be his assistant train driver and after year of try to conceive second child kirsty and her family decide that open their heart and their home to child through adoption be the good option however one of kirsty close friend also self employ and in the process of adopt inform she that she be not entitle to the same financial support through statutory adoption pay throw her plan into doubt unlike biological parent who qualify for maternity allowance or employ adopter who be eligible for statutory adoption pay self employ adopter such as kirsty fall into financial support void while statutory guidance allow local authority to make discretionary means test payment equivalent to these allowance for the self employ such support be not guarantee and local authority have no legal duty to provide it in fact freedom of information request by the charity home for good have reveal that of local authority lack any policy for provide this financial support even bad of self employ adopter when they be survey by the all party parliamentary group on adoption and permanence back in report that their social worker never advise they about these discretionary payment and the possibility of receive they adoption provide child with the opportunity to thrive in permanent love home often complete family as have have the great pleasure of see for myself in my role as proud adopt auntie be confident in my belief that member across the house will agree that self employ people be no less suited to adopt than anyone else despite the increase in the number of child in care the number of adoption in the uk have halve since its peak in and this be completely unsustainable the enormous and grow pressure that face our foster care system will only worsen if the number of adoption continue to decrease as of december there be million self employ people across the uk if we begin remove the financial barrier and empower those who be self employ through guarantee financial support for adoption we could begin to reverse the worrying trend in the number of adoption that would allow willing adopter such as kirsty and her husband to be financially able to do so the financial case for support adoptive parent be compelling research by the consortium of voluntary adoption agencies uk show that in adoption save the economy billion through improvement in child health education and employment prospect compare to the outcome for child who remain in care or other placement the cvaa also find that at least million worth of value be create when each child be adopt underscore the societal and economic benefit of increase adoption number have raise the glare gap in the financial support system several time in recent month have raise it with ministers in very constructive debate in westminster hall and with the leader of the house who recommend table an amendment to this bill the hon member for hitchin alistair strathern mention the upcoming review of parental leave and be sure the minister will mention it in sum up but really encourage the government to support new clause to grant entitlement to statutory adoption pay to the self employ we should be remove any barrier to adoption so that brilliant potential parent can adopt and some of our most vulnerable child can join their forever family refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my proud membership of usdaw and the gmb it be an honour to serve on the public bill committee for this historic piece of legislation the bill represent watershed moment turning point for work people in our country who for too long have be leave behind in an economy plague by weak employment right stagnant growth and the soar cost of living the measure contain in the bill represent meaningful intervention in our broken labour market look to promote good quality job that offer dignity security and respect to work people as someone with proud background represent worker wholeheartedly support the bill spirit and provision believe it will meet labour promise to deliver new deal for work people new deal that will make work pay whether it be ban exploitative zero hour contract end the scandal of fire and rehire or protect employee from unfair dismissal from day one the bill will promote good secure employment and workforce who finally feel value it recognise trade union as the force for good in the workplace that they be encourage positive productive and harmonious partnership between company and union the evidence we hear in committee make it clear that many of the bill measure enjoy broad support from both employee and employer such as the modernising of family friendly right to meet the need of today worker and the creation of the fair work agency which will protect good employer from be cynically undercut by unscrupulous competitor let now turn to statutory sick pay and government amendment during the pandemic it become clear that ssp be in desperate need of reform be therefore delighted that the bill remove the three waiting day and the low earning limit deliver great financial security to work people when they need it most however an issue remain set the amount low pay worker receive while off sick at of their wage have the unintended consequence of reduce sick pay for those who earn at or slightly above the low earning limit low pay long term sick worker will be the most affected believe that be an oversight and contrary to the spirit of the legislation call on the minister to close the gap turn now to the right to regular hour contract the proliferation of one side flexibility throughout the workforce have be one of the most damaging labour market development of the past year it have leave worker vulnerable to sudden change of income as their hour change from week to week the right to regular hour contract be therefore one of the bill most important provision however limit that right to those on specified number of hour such as hour week will unnecessarily exclude those above the threshold from benefit from the right while give employer perverse incentive to give additional hour when available to those who already have more hour raise these point not to be critical but because believe that we have in front of we magnificent piece of legislation one that be testament to the power of collaboration and consultation and want as many people as possible to benefit from it job be the cornerstone of our life the bill take giant stride forward ensure that people be fulfil by their job protect while at work and take home enough to make end meet it restore fair balance of power between employer and employee it be good for worker good for productivity and good for growth and be therefore good for business too suggest to the house that anyone serious about fairness at work and increase living standard should support it the hon gentleman talk about the bill be good for growth but be he concern that the government own assessment say it will cost business billion do he have any concern at all about the downward impact on growth of that cost think that bill that promote good secure work across the economy be something we should not shy away from believe if be correct that the figure reference represent of the cost of business so no be not concerned would like to finish in slightly odd place benjamin disraeli believe that his government active role in pass legislation that benefit the work person would gain and retain for the conservatives the last affection of the work class clearly he fail in that endeavour one nation tories be now vanishingly scarce presence on the opposition benches ask all hon member on those benches with their opposition to this bill when do the conservatives give up even try to be on the side of work people if growth be the intended destination as my friend in dublin would say you can get there from here this bill so long on amendment and so short on detail can not be reconcile with this government state mantra of growth growth growth by their own estimate the bill will cost business billion so easily dismiss by the hon member for worsley and eccles michael wheeler despite be serious amount of money the only growth will be in the mountain of red tape in which the bill will snare business rise to speak in favour of new clause which would require the secretary of state to have regard to the objective of the international competitiveness of the economy and its growth in the medium to long term the secretary of state for business must surely recognise the importance of this after all see he just day ago in slick video with cut quick than the shower scene in hitchcock psycho boast of work together abroad to deliver growth at home now love fantasy film as much as anyone but the secretary of state be in danger of jump the shark with this level of sophistry and stretch credulity beyond snap point growth at home be feeble and this bill be its enemy so lack in detail be this bill which be clearly scrabble together to beat the government own deadline of the first day that it be the equivalent of parliamentary blank cheque sign here and we will fill in all those pesky detail later hand sweeping power to the secretary of state we be be ask to walk into cage without key have see this before with the snp woeful prospectus for scottish independence in scot be bright enough then to see through the smokescreen will members across the house be sharp enough to discern the danger here do my hon friend agree that it be quite clear that the government do not do the work need to get the bill into the right place and position to be introduce to this house in the first place that be exemplified in committee with the amount of drafting that have to be do at that stage the bill should have be stop by the parliamentary business and legislation committee it should never have be allow to get to the floor of the house completely agree with my right hon friend he be very experienced parliamentarian and know full well that to arrive at this stage with as we have hear from other member telephone directory of amendment be quite an incredible situation how could any self respect secretary of state for business and trade stand over the anti growth regulation contain in but not confine to part and of this bill even trainee solicitor can see that they strip out flexibility for both employee and employer make it less likely that people especially young people and people with sketchy background will be hire for that all important first job whither your employee right if you have no job as someone who bend his elbow be familiar with the occasionally coarse atmosphere in pub my daughter take part time job in bar while study at university but see nothing useful for she in the bill bid to make employer liable for third party harassment it be why also support our amendment to exclude the hospitality sector from this onerous clause aside from the fact that my daughter be well capable of deal with the rare rude sexist or obstreperous client under exist law clause risk the bill become snooper charter busybody dream if our amendment fall the public bar will no long be the cockpit of free speech but place in the purview of the censorious and the malicious gauleiter of orthodoxy set as we be in sea of trouble amid global turmoil be labour really so afraid of off colour joke or the bar stool crank with outré political view that it will establish the banter police one of my criticism of the holyrood parliament in edinburgh be that it pass never mind the quality feel the width legislation in bid for self justification with this bill that accusation could rightly be level at this government too will be proud to see this bill progress through parliament and to develop accordingly that be what the amendment before we offer we the chance to do may pay tribute to my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh who be no long in her place and the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran for the work that they be do in the short time available to wish to speak to new clause which reflect manifesto commitment make by the labour party that say explicitly that the current parental leave system do not support work family million of people across this country will recognise that that be the case new clause be about put meat on the bone of that commitment because it be long overdue we be behind the curve in this country in how we treat dad wish to thank everybody who have sign this amendment because it send the message that we care about our father in this country we have the bad paternity leave in the eu as my hon friend the member for hitchin alistair strathern who be no long in his place point out two week be just enough time for the dad to realise that the meconium be go to stop and that they might eventually get three hour sleep at some point let we see how our economic competitor treat dad well dad get month in sweden eight month for each parent and three month protect for the dad in france spain norway and luxembourg dad get at least six week in japan they get year why do they do that it be because dad make difference yes this bill would give they day one right to paternity leave but only two week one in five of they in this country do not take any leave at all because they can not afford to do so they need pay and protect right of itself to benefit from paternity leave it benefit they and it benefit their kid it be well for the mental health of the father it mean that they take few sick day there be evidence to prove that and it be good for the kid it be also good for the mum we need to end the battle of the sex when it come to childcare because research show that woman really can not win even when we do not have kid we pay the price because of maternity discrimination we all know of employer who do not employ woman in their and because of the risk that lady do baby the challenge with this legislation which rightfully strengthen maternity discrimination power be that it could inadvertently reinforce that message if we do not bring forward legislation to support father interruption be glad conservative members support what be say wish they would vote with we on this tonight the gender pay gap do exist in this country but it be basically maternity pay gap because the motherhood penalty be all too real by the time of their first child woman wage be third below man within month member might say that that be to do with work part time but that be even when woman return to the front one in nine mum have be dismiss make redundant or force out woman be consider less competent in the workplace when they become mum as if juggle thing make they less able to do thing rather than more childless woman be eight time more likely to be promote conversely dad be consider more committed than non dad because we expect they to be in work pay for their child rather than help to look after they want to deal not in caricature but in cold hard cash above all support paternity leave in its own right and leave for the other parent in relationship be good for the economy it help boost woman participation and productivity country with well pay parental leave have small gender participation gap in their economy with all the economic benefit that that bring close that gap could bring billion into our of gdp the hon member be talk about the benefit of her new clause to father but do she accept that the effect of the bill will be negative and harmful to everyone and to the economy by strip billion away from business it be no good that her new clause would be helpful for father if the net effect of the bill be bad for everyone through the damage do to the economy wish that the hon gentleman have be listen because just point out that deal with the gender pay gap would bring billion to our economy that be exactly how we pay for well parental leave it be cost neutral proposal newsflash for those who have not work it out mother be already pay for this childcare in their low wage opportunity and progression woman salary be hit by after the birth of their first child woman be do million hour of unpaid childcare in this country which equate to billion worth of work twice as much as man consultation could explicitly look into these issue and at how we can share that cost and benefit fairly so that both man and woman can contribute equally to our society and look after their child equally it could look explicitly at self employ parent after all there be nearly million self employ dad in this country who pay billion in national insurance contribution they do not get any parental leave at all we know that share parental leave be not the answer only of dad have take it in the year that it have be available because it be not pay that be why we must be explicit that any consultation must look at the pay that need to be behind parental leave as well as at protect it those on the low income do not take share parental leave at all more shared parental leave have be claim in london alone than in wales scotland the north west and the north east combine above all this be about our kid god know we love they all dearly but we can all understand why of divorce take place in the first five year after have child because of the unequal situation that we put family in and the pressure that that create the mum and dad guilt we have choice in this place about whether we deal with mum and dad guilt with the government make proper commitment with proper timetable and with proper involvement from parliament and the women and equalities committee to all those who will say well struggle and so should you say that that be bad for the economy and bad for our kid it mean that father do not get the time to work out the quirk of their child so mum end up be the one who know how to cut the sandwich it mean that mum end up do more of the childcare and dad get push far away from their child if this government be serious about support family believe that they be they need to show we the detail that way in every family which come in all shape and size every parent whether the father the non birth parent or the mother will have the time to be the good parent and contributor that be why these policy be massively popular with conservative and reform voter if only the reform mp be here to do something for man for change this long overdue change will make difference hope that minister be listen to why it matter to show commitment to this and look forward to hear to what they have to say in response to the new clause royal assent have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the king have signify his royal assent to the follow act supply and appropriation anticipation and adjustments act crown estate act employment rights bill debate resume it be always pleasure to follow the king laughter rise on behalf of my constituent in farnham bordon haslemere and liphook who be oppose to this fundamentally anti business bill nothing have highlight more clearly than this debate the old adage that where we think the labour party be wrong it think that we be evil nothing that have come from labour members have give any consideration to the absolutely correct concern that the shadow minister my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith raise in his opening remark the bill which have be bodge both in committee and today have be put together simply to assuage the union paymaster that fund so many labour members the bill highlight labour complete misunderstanding of how to help business employee and of course the economy overall we have government who talk about growth but legislate to destroy it the government claim to be pro growth and pro business yet the bill be precisely the opposite the institute of directors have warn that it will lead to slow growth deter investment and bury business under an avalanche of unnecessary regulation even the government own impact assessment which opposition member have mention on number of occasion concede that business will face staggering billion in additional cost an economic straitjacket that will choke innovation and job creation labour members seem to have fail to realise that be pro business as the conservatives be be be pro worker because if business do not exist there will be no one to employ worker in my constituency alone we have over business the vast majority of which be small and medium sized enterprise many of they operate in the education retail and hospitality sector which rely on flexibility to survive yet the bill attack on hour contract threaten to wipe out opportunity for student part time worker and those juggle multiple job to make end meet among the small business in my hon friend constituency have my hon friend come across one that be in favour of the bill or lobby he to vote for it my hon friend make good point be happy for the minister to come to farnham and bordon or haslemere liphook or any other of my village to meet all the people who tell what damaging effect the bill will have on their small business as my hon friend point out the simple fact be that the government have not consult small business properly if they have the bill would be scrap think of the university for the creative arts student who rely on flexible work and the nhs paramedic in farnham pick up extra shift at the nelson arms as mention early those be real people whose livelihood be at risk because of the bill that be why support new clause and amendment on zero hour contract and employment tribunal ukhospitality have be clear that for of worker on zero hour contract that be their preference the sector rely on these contract to manage fluctuate demand and remove that flexibility could devastate those business and lead to job loss there be no job security for those who do not have job the house of commons library briefing actually support that confirm that zero hour contract provide essential flexibility for both employer and most importantly employee that be why support new clause and amendment which would demand review of the impact on employment tribunal of the provision concern zero hour worker before the government recklessly legislate against they the chartered institute of personnel and development have already make it clear that ban zero hour contract will hurt the very worker the government pretend to protect but yet again ministers plough ahead blind to the economic damage that they be about to unleash turn to amendment and new clause on unfair dismissal and business confidence the government proposal to grant employee the right to claim unfair dismissal from day one be another reckless intervention and one that be raise with by small business day in day out the amendment and new clause seek to introduce an impact assessment before clause and schedule come into force without that we have to be clear that business will be discourage from hire in the first place flexibility in employment be not one sided it benefit both worker and their employer similarly the right to request flexible working must be assess properly new clause and amendment rightly demand that the secretary of state assess the impact of clause before it come into force rush policymaking will not help worker or business it will create uncertainty and drive investment away that be why it be essential that we accept new clause in the name of the shadow secretary of state because we need an impact assessment of how the bill will affect business madam deputy speaker fear the clock may not have start for my speech so will draw to close hon member more more in that case shall carry on no no be conscious of my hon friend who wish to speak this government seem to have learn nothing from history we have hear history lesson from government members most of which have seem to take we back to the economic success do not come from shackle business with red tape or give trade union unchecked power it come from foster an environment where employer can hire invest and grow be proud to declare my membership of unite the union and the nasuwt and refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests before be elect be teacher for year today as we welcome this transformative legislation think of my former student their life will be significantly improve by well wage strong worker right and fairer economy welcome the bill which will drastically limit the exploitative use of fire and rehire just outside my constituency but affect many of my constituent directly more than oscar meyer worker be strike against the company appalling use of the practice by create new right to claim automatic unfair dismissal if someone be reemploye on varied term to carry out the same duty the bill take vital step towards dignify employee with security and autonomy my hon friend be give one of his trademark passionate speech do he agree with as former teacher myself that remove fire and rehire will give the young people that he use to teach the confidence that when they go into the workplace they will look at career and not just job wholeheartedly agree with everything my hon friend have say be also pleased to see government new clause encourage great employer compliance and increase compensation for worker subject to fire and rehire by raise the maximum period of the protective award from to day amendment table in my name seek to far protect against that harmful practice ensure that any clause in an employment contract that allow an employer to change the term without the employee consent would be unenforceable especially in case of unfair dismissal relate to refusal to accept change that would far help redistribute the power imbalance between employer and employee which currently allow low wage and poor working condition to become commonplace the bill also take crucial step towards ban exploitative zero hour contract ensure that all worker have predictable hour and offer security for their day to day life be pleased to see amendment extend such protection to agency worker we have all feel the effect of system that have leave so many behind flatline wage insecure work and fall living standard it be therefore not just my former pupil but million across the country who will benefit from the big upgrade to right at work in generation be proud to support our labour government in this historic step towards well quality employment across the country and look forward to the full delivery of the plan to make work pay diolch yn fawr rise to speak in support of new clause which would make carer leave pay right we have an opportunity to give carer in employment fair deal right across the country while also bolster our economy the government have an opportunity to build on the carer leave act introduce by my hon friend the member for north east fife wendy chamberlain and take the next step in provide work carer with the flexibility they need to juggle work and care carer uk estimate that the value to the economy of carer be able to work be billion when have meet major blue chip employer such as centrica and hsbc and their employee who have benefit from those corporation carer policy they be clear that have those policy in place to support caring be not only good for the employee but make they well employee for the employer the employer really benefit from have member of staff who support they and be also able to do the good for their family back our liberal democrat amendment to make carer leave pay entitlement would be the right thing to do on human level and would also support the government growth agenda for government on mission to spend less while also deliver growth and well living standard this be no brainer we must do everything we can to help those carer who can and want to work to do so currently the government have simply indicate that they will review the implementation of carer leave and consider whether there be need to change the current approach say to the government in the strong possible term that change be need and the time be now the million people who juggle job and caring responsibility be go above and beyond to care for those they love while also contribute to our economy many of they be on low income they be often woman and they can not afford to use their right to carer leave unless it become pay right we must acknowledge their work with fair deal for they know that this be something the carer in my constituency deserve they deserve well we must be adaptable to the change need of our population while also see the benefit this really can be win win my liberal democrat colleague and be also push for an amendment to make care protect characteristic when people apply for job equality monitoring form do not ask they whether they have unpaid caring responsibility there be also no direct requirement for simple reasonable adjustment for carer in the workplace feel that this would make all the difference encourage those who might otherwise leave employment to stay make our economy more resilient and protect their own family finance we know that be carer make people much more likely to fall into poverty carers uk research also tell we that almost half of all those who leave employment early to fulfil caring responsibility say that they would have stay in employment long have carer leave on pay basis exist it seem clear that pay carer leave help carer and those they care for and it be good for our economy hope the government can see that with the same clarity and do the right thing in support these vital liberal democrat amendment need to highlight to the house that be member of the community and usdaw trade union and refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests would like to speak to various bit of this legislation today there be so much in it and know that so many of we on the government back benches be really pleased with what we be bring forward the first part of the legislation that want to address be clause which will bring forward in future legislation more protection for woman who be pregnant on maternity leave and in the period immediately follow their maternity leave have spend the past year represent large number of woman who be either make redundant while pregnant on maternity leave or try to come back from maternity leave or whose employer suddenly wake up one morning and decide that they be underperform often within hour of their announce their pregnancy have client who have be headhunte and bring into the company be totally stellar do incredibly well and get promote but then announce her pregnancy and within week she be on performance plan hr explain to she that because they be you know kind and do not want to do that to she while she be pregnant they be very generously offer she settlement agreement so that she do not have to go through that lot of perfectly decent people do not understand why they be lose their job and it be because they be pregnant pregnant then screwed find that of woman who have have baby have either be sack constructively dismiss or make redundant while pregnant on maternity leave or within year of their maternity leave end it be widespread problem so it be fantastic that the bill contain clause which will allow the minister to bring forward step to expand the available protection would like to know how quickly we can do that because pregnant woman out there need that protection literally today my hon friend who have great expertise in this area be make an eloquent speech do she agree that dismissal of pregnant woman or new mother be dramatically under report because of the use of non disclosure agreement in lot of company while they be take action against they could talk about nda at some length but do not have time to today they be definitely problematic and they be definitely conceal the extent of the problem that woman suffer when they announce their pregnancy the second element like in the legislation be the improvement to the right to request flexible working those on the conservative benches have question why we would do this the answer be that the term part timer be still term of abuse in this country while that be still something that people say fairly regularly within workplace and popular parlance we still have problem so this legislation should help to improve that conservative members have talk lot about clause and the third party harassment element and it be worth get into some of the detail the defence for an employer for fail to protect their staff from third party harassment be take all reasonable step to prevent that harassment from occur employment tribunal have be interpret the meaning of reasonable for long time and in discrimination claim there be essentially three part judiciary judge with legal experience someone with employer experience and someone with employee experience sometimes from trade union but sometimes from elsewhere when they talk about all reasonable step it be only reasonable step it be not every single step in the entire history of the universe that anyone could ever dream up or imagine the hon member be speak powerfully do she agree that this amendment be be use by the conservative party to condone something offensive and despicable and that they be try to defend the indefensible completely and utterly agree with the hon member actually lot of what be come from conservative members be scaremongere lot of those discuss this behave as if employee with unfair dismissal right be unexploded bomb all the people represent do not want to bring tribunal claim they just want to have be treat fairly and reasonably in the first place they be typically extremely destress by their experience and for quite lot of they their mental health have deteriorate substantially in the course of what they have go through do not think that when people have unfair dismissal right little bit soon they will all be rush to employment tribunal the moment that something go slightly wrong in their workplace what most people want to do every morning be get up go to work do decent job get pay for it and go home that be what we will continue to see after this legislation pass that most employer want to look after their employee perfectly reasonably and most employee want to do perfectly decent job have be rather unsuccessful this afternoon in find someone on the government benches who have concern about the billion cost to business that this bill will bring will the hon member express concern over the billion cost and the downward pressure on growth that this bill bring accord to the government own assessment my primary concern be that those on the conservative benches talk about employee as if they be as say unexploded bomb and they talk about employer as if they be unlikely ever to recruit anyone ever again and just do not believe that to be true most employer will make sensible assessment of whether have an additional member of staff will benefit their business and then they will recruit they hon member hear hear thank you it be really important that we cut through the disinformation and scaremongere and that when we take the legislation forward acas have good information ready to go it already have great information online encourage employer who be worried to look up acas information video on youtube and look at its factsheet we must make it clear to people that they have access to source of free advice which be important for small business so that they can see what be and be not require of they the position be state today be bluntly exaggerated and quite damaging as result rise to speak in favour of my new clause the labour abuse that it seek to address be the wrongful use of substitution clause by gig economy worker to guarantee fairness and justice in the labour market it be crucial that there be transparency which can be deliver through the introduction of comprehensive register of all dependent contractor that will help to ensure that employment right be uphold and pay be not suppress through illegitimate competition but it will also support the enforcement of right to work check the unlawful employment of migrant with no right to work here be not good for taxpayer british worker or migrant who follow the rule yet substitution clause allow what have become know as deliveroo industrial scale abuse of our immigration and labour law before address the substance of my new clause also commend new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for bridgwater sir ashley fox which have sponsor it would give special constable the right to take time off to carry out their police duty other public service volunteer such as magistrate and councillor receive that right turn to my new clause minister have say that they will consult on employment status and move towards two part legal framework that identify people who be genuinely self employ support that ambition and be grateful to the minister for his warm word in committee but my new clause provide way to resolve particular abuse and hold big employer in the gig economy to account there be million gig economy worker in the uk include official rider at uber eats and deliveroo two of the large delivery company in the country for year we have hear story of the rampant labour market fraud and visa abuse commit by contractor relate to those company from late to early there be fraudulent uber journey accord to transport for london in addition to uber and deliveroo amazon and just eat have be link to labour market abuse much of that abuse have come through the legal loophole create by substitution clause amazon tell its courier that it be their responsibility to pay your substitute at any rate you agree with they and you must ensure that any substitute have the right to work in the uk it be dereliction of duty to pass responsibility for compliance with criminal and right to work check on to worker but those company clearly have an interest in maintain status quo in which undocumented migrant take the low fee in delivery app datum from the rodeo app show the effect of that abuse on rider order fee just eat rider see their fee drop by from in to in there be drop for uber eats order fee from to during the same period deliveroo have block its order fee datum from be publish those figure be not adjust for inflation but it be clear to see how pay and condition have worsen for rider by undercut domestic worker british worker and exploit those with no legal right to be here company be privatise profit and socialise cost promise from such company to introduce tough security check have not make the problem go away we should all be appal by this state of affair because nobody should be above the law during random check two year ago the home office find that two in five delivery rider who be stop be work illegally in the same month rider from uber eats deliveroo and just eat be arrest in london for immigration offence include work illegally and hold false documentation last month deliveroo sack more than rider who share their account with illegal migrant but that be only the tip of the iceberg insurance company report unauthorised rider involve in motor and personal injury case that be happen because undocumented migrant be rent rider account for between and week profile have be buy for as much as the paper find more than people on facebook group where identity have be trade for year include one group that gain around member in less than month illegal migrant be use social medium app to rent account and share information on significant scale today we only have figure from press investigation but we can find copious example across the internet with ease legal worker have report problem to the police and the home office but that have fuel tension as they compete for order and have even lead to violent clash between legal and illegal rider in brighton and london include physical beating and damage to bike people work illegally for these big company be work long hour round the clock for low fee never know when their last payday might be they use group chat to share information and evade home office immigration raid we do not even know how many substitute rider there be for these company at any give time spokesman for the app drivers and couriers union say unfortunately there be this loophole that allow some bad people to come through they be not vet so they could do anything obviously my hon friend hop that the government will support his new clause what do he think would stop the government support this very sensible measure straightaway do not see why the government should not support this new clause this seem to be an obvious example of labour market abuse but the difference with many of the provision in the bill be that my new clause do not directly benefit trade union who pay for the labour party sadly we know that there have be many sexual assault and attack commit by substitute worker new clause propose the robust regulation of substitution clause amazon uber deliveroo and the rest would have to do their due diligence and just like everyone else ensure that all their rider be who they say they be and have the right to work in this country introduce such change would reduce labour abuse protect our community and deliver fairer labour market refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests just to inflame matter more be the chair of the rmt parliamentary group as well next monday be the third anniversary of the scandal member might recall what happen member of staff rmt member largely turn up for work and be sack by video many of they be marshal off their vessel by train bouncer and guard who deal with they roughly the reaction across the house and across society be that this be repellent and should not happen in civilised society the labour party then make commitment that it would introduce legislation that would install in law the seafarer charter and that be exactly what the bill do so welcome it wholeheartedly and congratulate the minister on do this but as he can guess we see this as just the first step because there be so much more to do particularly in this sector where many worker be still exploit compare with shore base worker government new clause extend the maximum period of the protective award from day to day we be look for an uncapped award to be frank because build into the pricing the amount it would be fin as result of its unlawful behaviour so that do not matter to it simply price that in in addition we be look for injunctive relief and thank the government for enter into discussion about that many employer can get injunctive relief on the tiny error by union in ballot procedure but worker can not we be ask for level playing field we hop that an amendment would be table to the bill today but it have not be we hope the government will enter into those discussion and go far wonder whether my right hon friend recall the evidence of peter hebblethwaite the chief executive of ferries to the business and trade committee he make it clear that he deliberately break the law and have no regard for it be my right hon friend as horrify as be to see that in this house and as disappoint at the lack of response from the conservative party think that across the house it take long while to recover from the anger at the behaviour that be display in front of the select committee the chief executive be act with impunity because he have be able to price in those sort of fine and it be cross party view that we be angry about that behaviour that be why the charter be so important to we and why injunctive relief that be open to trade union would provide an adequate starting point for get some form of justice range of other issue need to be address include schedule where the government be introduce the ability to monitor the behaviour of company harbourmaster monitor some of that behaviour as well with declaration that company be abide by basic health and safety practice some practice in the past have be frankly terrifying we want health and safety to be about more than just basic legislation it be also about roster and how long people be work we still have ferry contract where people be work for week without break we want to ensure that the regulation cover roster as well as holiday pay sick pay pension and rating training so that we can start to get some form of accountability within the sector that be not much to ask for yet we have give shipping owner billion of tonnage tax exemption in return for the employment of british seafarer and do not think we get single job as result of that billion there be need for proper regulation of the sector table an amendment to ask the government to stand back once year and bring report to the house on how implementation of the bill be go and to update we on the implication for maritime law and international labour organisation convention and the impact on the sector lot of debate on this issue have be about ferry but we want to ensure that the provision apply to all vessel not just ferry one point make by those on the labour front bench when consider the seafarers wages bill be that if ship come into harbour time year the legislation would apply now do not know why that have be extend to time year which mean that thousand of worker will lose out because the measure will not apply to they will the government have another conversation about that and see whether we can revert to the original position of the labour party all those year ago when these scandal happen there be not much time but briefly be interested in the extension of sectoral collective bargaining right across the economy we be do it with social care but what have see from proposal in the bill do not look like sectoral collective bargaining to it look simply like an extension of pay review body indeed the bill state that any agreement within those organisation can not legally be accept as collective bargaining the bill be not clear about how member of the negotiate body be appoint or by who we be expect that it would be employer and trade union and table an amendment to try to secure that we think that the negotiate body should elect its own chair not that the chair should be appoint by the secretary of state we want such body to be independent and successful because see that as the first step in roll out sectoral collective bargaining in many other sector of our economy that be desperately need because of the lack of trade union right and the low pay that exist the bill be good first step but there be long agenda to go through look forward not just to the bill proceeding but to the minister bring forward an employment rights no bill in the next month rise to speak in support of new clause which appear in the name of the right hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh pay tribute to she and to my hon friend the member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran who have campaign on these issue for long time new clause seek to ban non disclosure agreement that prevent worker from make disclosure about harassment include sexual harassment we have talk about sexual harassment in the workplace for the last four or five hour nda be initially design to protect trade secret by restrict the sharing of certain information but in recent time they have take on an entirely different and quite sinister role they have essentially become the default solution for organisation and individual to settle case of misconduct discrimination and harassment keep the extent of such incident unaccounte for incorporate clear provision to ensure transparency in case of harassment would strengthen protection for all worker datum from ca buy my silence have reveal some deeply worrying statistic about the misuse of nda in survey of more than people who experience harassment and discrimination in the workplace report be force to sign an nda while an additional state that they could not say due to legal reason imply that they have also sign an nda four time as many woman as man sign nda and they be use disproportionately against woman of colour in committee the minister say that the government have reservation about change the law in this way as there may be unintended consequence struggle to understand why the government have commit to ban university from use nda in case of sexual misconduct harassment and bullying but have not commit to extend those protection to other sector nda be clearly be use in totally different way to what they be design to achieve and we must stop this before more victim be silence hear the minister say early that he be at least look at what new clause be try to achieve despite my concern about the misuse of nda the bill as whole have many very positive provision importantly it finally legislate to protect worker from third party harassment bring that forward in my original bill that become the worker protection amendment of equality act act which recently become law however it be block by amendment make to the bill in committee in the house of lords by the conservative party so that such liability and protection from sexual harassment by third party in the workplace be not create we have already discuss that several time this afternoon be most pleased that the government have commit to make workplace safe through this protection because that be what this be all about create safe workplace be good for everyone include business despite what the conservative party say study by culture shift find that of business believe that prevent sexual harassment be very important do not know what conservative member be talk about when they say that their inboxe be full have not see single email from business writing to to say that it be worried about protect its own employee from third party harassment accord to worknest three quarter of employer be still concerned about protect employee from harassment by third party business be concerned that they can not protect their worker from third party harassment they clearly want these protection to be include in the bill too many people still suffer from third party harassment at work amendment which try to remove those important provision be plain wrong employer have duty to ensure the safety of their employee from not just other employee but third party who may interact with they in the workplace that responsibility should be part of their broad commitment to workplace safety if the conservative party be truly committed to world without harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace why be it still condone offensive language and behaviour as banter and free speech rather than take step to support business and protect worker from sexual harassment in the workplace as propose in the bill be grateful that the government have ensure the completion of my act as it be intend year or two ago although remain concerned about the misuse of nda welcome many of the provision in the bill will be proud to walk through the no lobby when we come to vote on amendment and hope that all right minded people will join there refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be proud member of the trade union usdaw unison and gmb and be also proud to have work at domestic abuse charity for six year that be why rise today to speak in support of new clause which have table with the support of colleague from across the house be an officer of the all party parliamentary group on domestic violence and abuse the secretariat of which be ably provide by woman aid have table this new clause follow evidence present to the appg with the drafting support of the law firm hogan lovells new clause would require employer with five or more employee to publish domestic abuse policy outline the support they provide to worker who be victim of domestic abuse some million people predominantly woman experience domestic abuse each year this be not niche issue but one that pervade every level of society often with devastating effect for example we know that around people in the uk be at high or imminent risk of be murder or seriously harm by an abuser some member may wonder how domestic abuse relate to employer and may question whether the new clause be necessary to they say that domestic abuse be workplace issue up to of woman who experience domestic abuse be target at work we know that perpetrator often harass woman at their workplace through phone call or by arrive unannounced abuser can also be colleague research by the tuc find that of victim survey say that their perpetrator work in the same place that they do for example jane clough year old nurse be stab time in by her former partner an ex ambulance technician outside the hospital where they have work and meet victim survivor need and deserve more support from their workplace number of trade union and the tuc have campaign on this issue alongside domestic abuse charity the domestic abuse commissioner and survivor themselves one survivor tell the domestic abuse charity savelives everyone at work know they must have do wish someone have say something ask how be think if my manager have know what to do or say she would have like to help but the conversation just seem too hard perhaps it be important to note that the previous government introduce guidance on this issue alongside the domestic abuse act however without mandatory duty on employer the support that victim can expect remain lottery the employers initiative on domestic abuse estimate that only of employer have policy of course domestic abuse also have financial impact both on victim and the organisation they work for over one in five woman take time off work because of abuse and of victim say that abuse negatively impact their work performance due to they be distract tired or unwell abuse stunt career progression and research undertake by vodafone and kpmg have find that the potential loss of earning for each victim be year this clearly have severe knock on impact for business and the economy in the home office estimate that domestic abuse cost the uk economy around billion year in lose economic output mandatory domestic abuse policy be therefore pro worker pro business and pro growth indeed study in new zealand find that introduce domestic abuse protection in the workplace have cut cost for business in that country and lead to increase level of productivity embed domestic abuse in the ethos and practice of company here in the uk be vital step be happy to say that some organisation have already take that step lead by the pioneer employers initiative on domestic abuse which support over business large and small that collectively comprise over quarter of the uk workforce be glad that company such as sainsbury argos and poundland already offer employee pay leave to enable victim survivor to attend medical or legal appointment or to seek safe accommodation however we need all workplace and all victim to be cover victim survivor deserve far more support than they currently receive and workplace be often the only safe place for victim to seek support and safety but culture of shame or stigma fear of not be believe or even concern about lose their job due to disclosure be fail victim support those victim should be see as key duty that would secure their health and safety be grateful to the minister for acknowledge the government commitment to victim of abuse in the forthcoming violence against woman and girl strategy but we would like to see something more at least taskforce consist of domestic abuse charity employer and trade union with crucially input from survivor and the domestic abuse commissioner that would complement the vawg strategy we need much clear commitment from the department to proceed with this important matter look forward to work far with ministers across departments and to work with my hon friend the member for gloucester alex mcintyre on his ten minute rule bill to introduce pay leave for domestic abuse survivor because victim of domestic abuse can not wait let begin by draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as other conservative members have already point out the flaw in this bill be numerous it will damage business and ultimately employment opportunity and be deeply concerned about its consequence for our economy both nationally and in my constituency the government have say that they want to grow the economy but the bill will penalise and stifle those who do just that business of all size investor and entrepreneur these be the people who grow our economy only if we grow our economy can we invest in our much need public service and only then can we provide the significant increase in defence investment that be need more than ever at this time we ought to be empower business to deliver growth but the bill add burden on business to such an extent that by the government own admission it will cost the economy up to billion year in fact believe that that be fairly conservative estimate and that it will probably cost much more survey after survey have show that business confidence have go through the floor although do not need survey to tell that because my inbox have receive steady stream of message from local business reach out to share the detrimental impact of the budget and their concern about the impact of measure in the bill every week visit and meet business owner across my constituency and the message be consistent and clear how can the government expect the economy to grow when it penalise the growth creator amendment table by the opposition offer reasonable and pragmatic compromise to mitigate the unintended consequence of place duty on employer to prevent third party harassment in the hospitality sector have listen closely to the debate on that issue so let say strongly that harassment of any sort be absolutely wrong do not for one moment condone or excuse any kind of harassment in the hospitality sector or indeed in any other area the reality be however that in pub restaurant social setting or hospitality setting thing may be say that be not acceptable as have already be make clear this be not condone sexual harassment it be make clear that we simply can not legislate for people word or language in every context we must have free speech surely it be reasonable to protect our landlord and restaurant owner in the hospitality sector and to include provision exempt they in the bill if it have to be pass at all it can not be fair to expect landlord to be responsible for every conversation that take place on their premise it have be make clear to by the many landlord and restaurant owner across my constituency whom have meet since my election whether it be woody who run the swan in tarporley and the lion at malpas or jarina at the rasoi and the bulls head that employee welfare be top priority for they know that they do everything they can to treat staff exceptionally well and to protect they from third party harassment they want their staff to be safe and secure but make such business liable for other people behaviour and language be step too far and will have detrimental impact on our hospitality sector let end by reiterate my deep and fundamental concern about the bill as whole will not be support it today there be opposition amendment that would improve it and hope that they will be support because they be pragmatic and give glimmer of hope to business face with what be otherwise very damaging legislation also hope that when labour member vote this evening they will consider the consequence of the bill and the way in which it be detrimental to growth something that the government have seek to pursue refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests and the fact that be trade union member this government be elect on the promise to deliver the big boost to worker right in generation and that be exactly what this bill will do the previous government oversee system that leave work people pay the price for economic decline through insecurity poor productivity and low pay the measure in this bill will make serious difference to work people life nine million people will benefit from day one protection against unfair dismissal the around mother who be dismiss each year after return from maternity leave will be protect and million people on low wage will receive statutory sick pay for the first time in luton north and elsewhere these right will make real and meaningful difference to people especially those in new job on low income or with insecure contract as former care worker know that fair pay in adult social care bring worker and employer together to agree pay and condition across the whole sector will be transformational and be long overdue during covid when many carer risk their life and those of their family to care for other the last government hand out clap give out bin bag in place of personal protective equipment and send carer off to food bank this government be deliver the recognition that social care be skilled value and vital to thriving society will speak in my role as chair of the women and equalities committee our committee report in january show the need for bereavement leave follow pregnancy loss give my wholehearted thank to all who give evidence which lead to our report and the amendment that follow thank member from across the house for their support and especially thank the brave woman who share their experience of lose pregnancy with our committee all of they have only the option of sick leave and every single witness say it be time for change grant sick leave to grieve the loss of pregnancy be not appropriate first it mean that woman worker be leave fearful that human resource process will kick in follow the accrual of sick leave secondly it wrongly reinforce the feeling that there be something wrong with their body thirdly it make they feel unable to talk about their miscarriage with both their employer and their colleague as they should be able to do it be as if miscarriage be something shameful to approach one boss about from small business to big business such as the co op group and tui many employer already offer bereavement leave follow miscarriage as do the nhs which be the large public sector employer of woman they all show that do the right thing be good for worker and good for business and be so pleased to hear the minister commit to work with the other place to introduce miscarriage bereavement leave this labour government will make the uk only the fourth country in the world to recognise the need for bereavement leave follow miscarriage which be truly world lead we will be lead light in world that seem to be take backwards step on woman right although such leave be not pay as outline in my amendment it be significant step forward it not only provide right but go long way towards further how we talk about pregnancy loss in society as whole miscarriage should no long be ignore and stigmatise as sickness people have be move to tear of joy relief and raw emotion on discover that their loss be now acknowledge and that thing will change later tonight in the privacy of my home will probably be one of those people commend the hon lady for her passion and compassion for her honesty and for talk about this subject in the chamber we all recognise her commitment to the task that she have set herself and this government will deliver it for she welcome that because we have all lose love one we have mother and sister who have have miscarriage and we have family member and colleague who have have miscarriage that be why we commend the hon lady for make special contribution thank the hon member for his kind intervention and thank many member for their support throughout the year experience pregnancy loss while be an mp and the kindness of colleague in this place get though but at no point do any of they wrap their arm around and say get well soon they all say sorry for your loss be so glad that today the minister have commit to the law reflect society view on miscarriage thank the department for business and trade team and especially the minister for meet the challenge set by the women and equalities committee each of the committee member be committed to this and it be enable by our excellent clerks thank the member who have support my amendment and our amendment and so many people for their campaigning work many member have be very kind and have express gratitude to for table the amendment but this be actually team job with team work and campaign span many year that campaigning work include inspiration such as myleene klass my hon friend the member for sheffield hallam olivia blake and the former member angela crawley as well as brilliant organisation such as the miscarriage association tommy sands and pregnant then screwed and all their supporter however want to say special thank you to vicki and her team at the miscarriage association both professionally and personally she be voice for so many during their dark time thank you this change mean that the law will finally catch up with society view on pregnancy loss it be giant leap forward in the recognition that miscarrying be bereavement not an illness and worker will legally have the right to grieve it be particular pleasure to follow former colleague of mine my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen what she have say will have special resonance with the many people who be follow this debate in this chamber and beyond she have do valuable public service and we thank she for it as be customary draw attention to my declaration in the register of members financial interests and to my membership of the gmb and unite trade union because time be limited will restrict my comment to opposition amendment on the school support staff negotiating body this amendment seek to disapply the sssnb statutory remit from both academy and local authority maintain school which make it substantially different from and more damaging than the similar amendment bring forward in committee if it be carry it would reduce protection for many school support staff worker in employment the vast majority of school support staff be already cover by collective bargaining almost directly and the rest indirectly however the exist agreement through the national joint council do not serve support staff or employer well last year teach assistant be pay just on average and of those worker be woman have speak to some who have rely on food bank and payday loan to make end meet there be school support staff worker in my constituency of birmingham northfield and they deserve well most school struggle to recruit for those role accord to research by the national foundation for educational research and at one point during the pandemic the role of teaching assistant be the second hard to recruit for after that of hgv driver this be not just about pay as the harpur brazel case show substantial liability also exist for employer because of unclear and outdated term and condition as the confederation of school trusts represent academy employer have say the time have come to move school support staff out from under the local government negotiate umbrella indeed the request from school employer be for the bill to establish floor not ceiling that point be address in committee so we might ask why this amendment have be bring forward it be in contradiction to the amendment that the opposition table in the children wellbeing and schools public bill committee after all it be the conservatives who put the school teachers review body on statutory footing back in the early so why will they not support the same step for school support staff similarly they be not seek to amend the bill in respect of the adult social care negotiating body despite the similarity between the two occupation fear that the answer be that school support staff the majority of people who work in school be suffer from the soft prejudice of unequal knowledge and interest that divide the workforce into professional and ancillarie this outdated attitude should be confine to the dustbin of history where it belong it be reject in this place almost year ago when the process that lead to the sssnb begin this be not measure whose time have come it be long overdue wish to say little about the importance of the measure for special educational need and disability classroom base support staff spend the majority of their time support send learner they be essential to school model of inclusion my hon friend be give an excellent speech and refer to really important group of people as former teacher mention it quite often recognise the huge importance of what school support staff provide to the classroom do he agree that they support not just learner but teacher too and have wide influence on the school community agree my hon friend make very important point when we look back at the national agreement in the early which lead to the expansion of school support staff role the justification be that they would alleviate pressure on teacher and add to the quality of teaching in classroom that be exactly what school support staff worker in my constituency and his do every day school support staff role be essential for send support but the contract those staff be employ under be so squeeze that no pay time be available for professional development or training in other word we can not resolve the send crisis without contract reform and we can not achieve that contract reform if the drift and delay which be the legacy of the decision to abolish the sssnb continue urge the opposition even now to think again and not press their amendment to vote in the time remain wish to say few word about the provision on hospitality worker and their right not to be subject to third party harassment when the hon member for bath wera hobhouse who be formerly in her place bring forward her private member bill in the last parliament it contain the same provision that be be advance now at the start of the debate in the house of lords the extension of the protection to all reasonable step be support by the government of the day baroness scott lead for the conservative party say that the measure would not infringe on freedom of speech in fact they would strengthen it the conservative front benchers be right then and they be wrong today the bill be incredibly important employment law in the united kingdom have tend to advance by increment the bill measure progress in stride be proud to have have some association with it through the public bill committee thank the departmental team who be part of the process and the other member of the committee will be proud to vote in favour of the extension to right in the bill when they be bring forward to vote tonight as proud trade unionist refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests today mark truly historic moment the most significant expansion of employment right in more than generation extend my congratulation to the secretary of state and the deputy prime minister for their effort and express my enormous gratitude to the employment right minister my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders for his time and engagement with over recent month in discuss the measure in the bill also wish to acknowledge the dedication of bill committee member as well as the countless trade union officer academic labour party member and staffer who have work tirelessly for decade to bring we to this day this be milestone we have long strive for on personal note extend my sincere thank to the prime minister for entrust while in opposition with the responsibility of deliver labour green paper new deal for working people speak in support of the government amendment and will touch on my own table amendment select for discussion specifically support government new clause and government new schedule which will extend guarantee hour protection to nearly million agency worker this be crucial step align with my own amendment and be pleased to see the government take it forward the tuc have rightly emphasise that for these right to be effective they must apply to all worker include agency worker be essential to prevent unscrupulous employer from circumvent new protection by shift to agency staff exploitative tactic employ by minority of employer design to avoid responsibility and deny worker job security remain deep concern which be precisely why have consistently advocate for single employment status table new clause because believe that establish single status of worker be necessary step to end unfair employment practice the government next step to make work pay document publish alongside the bill state their intent to consult on move towards single worker status on second reading note that we can not truly eradicate insecure work until we establish clear and unified employment status since then the director of labour market enforcement margaret beels have tell the business and trade committee that the whole business of employment status need to be address add that you can probably consult until the cow come home on this issue it be about time to do something about it the tuc also urge rapid review of employment status to prevent tactic such as bogus self employment from proliferate as employer respond to new right welcome the business and trade committee recommendation that the government must prioritise their review of employment status and address false self employment so that these reform be roll out alongside the employment rights bill acknowledge the new clause table by the chair of the committee my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne which seek to establish deadline for this consultation urge the government to accelerate progress on this front but take reassurance from the fact that this issue be well understand at the high level turn to collective redundancy and the unacceptable practice of fire and rehire acas report in that the use of fire and rehire tactic by employer be prevalent in the uk and have increase since the pandemic nearly fifth of young people say their employer have try to rehire they on inferior term many will recall how shamelessly break the law choose to pay compensation rather than comply with its legal obligation because it calculate that replace its workforce with cheap labour would ultimately be more profitable welcome the government consultation on collective redundancy and their introduction of new clause which double the maximum protective award for unfairly dismiss worker to day pay however while this may deter some employer question whether it be sufficient deterrent to prevent further abuse the tuc have raise concern that merely double the cap will still allow well resource employer to treat breach their legal obligation as the cost of do business the tuc instead propose strong deterrent the introduction of interim injunction to block fire and rehire attempt an approach have seek through new clause mick lynch the outgoing general secretary of the rmt tell the bill committee that union should have the power to seek injunction against employer like he rightly point out the power be all with the report employment rights public bill committee november and that union currently lack the legal mean to stop mass dismissal before they happen my new clause offer solution give employee immediate redress through an injunction if they can show that their dismissal be likely to be in breach of the new law ensure that they remain employ with full pay until final ruling be make encourage the minister to address this issue in his response and to indicate an openness to consider injunctive power in this parliament my hon friend have play such an important role in the development of these policy he be make wide range speech in his remain remark will he reflect on the importance of not just individual right but collective right my hon friend highlight critical issue this be about make that shift and reverse the decline in collective bargaining we should be look for the international labour organisation standard and as per the european union to get to collective bargaining coverage across the piece also note the concern of the tuc and unite regard government new clause to on the one establishment issue and urge they to engage with the union on these issue much have be say about wealth creator but there need to be recognition that work people be wealth creator and they be entitle to their fair share the chair of the business and trade committee call for consensus at the core of this discussion have to be that good well pay secure unionised employment be good for our constituent our business and our economy and this crucial employment rights bill be an essential step along that road to bright economy and bright future for all our people it be an absolute honour to follow my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald and know the whole house will join in thank he for all the work that he have do in shape the bill before we today the employment rights bill which be also proud to have play small part in shaping represent once in generation opportunity the bill be testament to the value that we stand for fair day pay for fair day work dignity protection bargaining power for worker and safety net for the most vulnerable when they need it the most there be much to celebrate in the bill as we have hear in the many excellent contribution today have also put my name to many of the amendment that we have hear hon member speak to in the house do feel that all of they be design to strengthen the bill far however give the time constraint shall focus my remark on my amendment relate to statutory sick pay as we all know and as have be say very eloquently today the current system of statutory sick pay be not just insufficient but completely and inexcusably break we have the bad system in europe which be shameful worker be entitle to just of the average weekly wage yet the cost of living do not suddenly plunge by when they be sick their rent their energy bill and their grocery tab be not discount so why do ssp remain such paltry sum be force to survive on week if they be lucky enough to get that in the first place leave worker expose to financial hardship it force many to make the difficult decision to go to work when they be unwell it be therefore quite right that the government have put forward major necessary and welcome reform they include remove the three day waiting period so that worker be entitle to sick pay from day one of illness and extend sick pay to all worker by remove the low earning limit and implement fair earning replacement percentage of these reform will directly benefit more than million low pay worker disproportionate number of whom continue to be those from black asian and minority ethnic background woman and young people there be much more that we can do to strengthen the bill which be why have table two amendment which will do just that and ensure that no worker be leave behind amendment call for sick pay to be align with the national living wage let make it clear that uprating ssp be popular with business as well as with worker six in employer agree that the rate be simply too low for worker to survive on we know that because the poverty rate among those claim ssp be more than double that among the overall work population amendment make it clear that if person be work full time they should not be pay poverty wage when they be unwell no one should have to choose between their health and their financial security which be why my amendment would immediately raise ssp to around of the average weekly wage put we on par with many of our european counterpart my new clause be about ensure fairness although welcome the government propose system the reality be that worker may actually end up worse off than they be today those who earn slightly above the current low earning limit of up to per week would receive of their earning which be low than the ssp rate that they would receive today we can not allow anyone to be leave behind although remove the wait period put more money in people pocket from the beginning of the illness period worker take more than four week off due to long term condition go through cancer treatment recover from serious operation or suffering from mental health crisis will face the big loss under the new system research have find that the cost of presenteeism to the private sector in mental ill health alone be billion year do my hon friend agree that show that reform our statutory sick pay be the most pro prosperity pro productivity policy that we can pursue my hon friend be absolutely right and he make the case brilliantly against some of the nonsense argument about productivity that we have hear from the conservative benches today it be the right thing to do but also it will lead to much improve productivity and well healthy happy workforce as well as be much well for the employer my amendment and new clause would ensure that every worker receive at the very least the same amount of sick pay that they would have do under the current system and not penny less urge the government to support they as they be very much in the spirit of this legislation congratulate my hon friend and his colleague on advance the bill eight month into their mandate we be at the remain stage in northern ireland month after restoration the propose ni good job bill have not even be introduce and doubt be grow as to whether it will pass in this mandate once again worker and business in northern ireland be pay the cost of dither and lack of ambition do he agree that those same barrier to people on sick pay also apply to woman on maternity leave would he support in principle my new clause which would raise statutory maternity pay for woman in work to the living wage for the later part of maternity leave absolutely my hon friend make the case brilliantly would support that in principle because the challenge be exactly the same say at the beginning of my speech that many of the amendment if not all not the one table by the opposition but the reasonable one from the government benches be constructive and design to improve the bill far my hon friend the minister and have have the great pleasure of work together for many month on the bill so he will know that come from position of sincerity to strengthen the bill far fully understand that amendment be probe amendment which will not be vote on in lobbies however it do reflect the ambition that we should rightly have because it be shameful frankly that we be in the situation of offer among the low statutory sick pay our partner across europe quite rightly be much well on this ask the minister to seriously consider new clause again it do not ask for any immediate action today it ask the government to come back to the house in three month to report back that nobody will be bad off as result of these measure do not think that be ever an intended consequence of the government excellent measure so look forward to my hon friend engage with far on that finally want to end by pay tribute to the million of worker who be the backbone of our economy it be my hope that with the amendment and new clause that we have propose today we can take significant step towards society that reward worker instead of punish they that treat they with dignity instead of malice and where no one must choose between their health and their livelihood place proudly on the record that be currently member of unite and gmb refer hon member to my entry in the register of members financial interests take the opportunity to pay tribute to my good friend terry jones brilliant scouse trade unionist who sadly pass away this morning he support the bill wholeheartedly forty five year after margaret thatcher begin her war on trade union the bill be hugely welcome and long overdue it be step to turn back the tide and strengthen the power of worker in former life as an industrial organiser for unite the union see how difficult it be to build industrial strength in workplace because of the restrictive legislation support by previous government of all colour the bill will hopefully begin at long last to turn back that tide hon member have already discuss key measure in the bill and there be so much to welcome congratulate the minister on his effort in get the bill to this place and also congratulate he and his team on take two point off arsenal which help we no end on sunday the bill need to be not the end though but the beginning of renewal of trade union right if we want to tackle the injustice do to the work class from low pay and poverty to sordid inequality we need to empower the institution that be found to fight for the work class be in no doubt about the scale of the problem of those who use the nine food pantry run across liverpool be in work include public sector worker from nurse to department for work and pensions worker let that sink in of those rely on emergency food aid be in work that tell we how break the labour market be for so many people economic growth go hand in hand with fix the break economic settlement hence the importance of the bill will focus my comment on the amendment but for the record tomorrow we will debate two new clause that have table about uphold trade union right and outsourcing my amendment for debate today amendment and be aim at strengthen protection against unfair dismissal but in my brief time will focus on amendment table by colleague my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald have table series of crucial amendment to strengthen the bill he deserve huge amount of credit for get the bill to this place his amendment include amendment to which would enhance the bill provision against zero hour contract those contract leave worker with precious little control over their life allow boss to dictate shift with little or no notice with worker vulnerable to gross exploitation it be no wonder that worker overwhelmingly prefer regular contract for example when wetherspoons introduce the option of guarantee hour for its workforce of worker opt for that with just choose the zero hour contract model the amendment would help ensure that when we say we be ban exploitative zero hour contract we actually mean it my hon friend have also table new clause to which would strengthen the bill protection against the disgraceful practice of fire and rehire see in my own family the devastating impact that this cruel practice can have in destroy livelihood when my brother be victim of fire and rehire at british gas this immoral practice should never again be able to be use by rogue employee as weapon against the work class of this country fully support those strengthen new clause my hon friend the member for bradford east imran hussain have table amendment which would raise statutory sick pay to the level of the national living wage and new clause which would guarantee that worker do not lose out under the new fair earning replacement proposal we should have learn from the pandemic that no one should be force into work when they be ill those amendment and other would help to make that reality really hope that the minister and front bench members be listen the devastating consequence of thatcherism assault on working class community and trade union be see in town and city across the country once vibrant industrial town have be hollow out and industry destroy with insecure work replace well pay unionised job the never end doom loop must be break if we be to rebuild community that at the moment feel forget betray and abandon by successive government since thatcher the bill must be decisive step in break away from fail settlement and finally build country that work for we all refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be proud trade union member and in my career have campaign for more right for support staff and teach assistant in school for well bargaining right for care worker for people to have contract that affect the hour they work and for statutory sick pay from day one be proud that the bill will deliver all those thing and much more for work people up and down the country rise to speak to the issue of parental leave which have come up in relation to many amendment and in contribution from member across the house since be elect in july have speak three time in the chamber about the terrible inequality around dad right and paternity pay include in my maiden speech during the international men day debate and again in the debate on this bill in last october therefore welcome the clause that support dad right and will encourage more man to take their paternity leave entitlement in the last parliament my hon and gallant friend the member for barnsley north dan jarvis introduce private member bill that come into force in april the protection from redundancy pregnancy and family leave act extend the protect period from redundancy for parent the protect period be the length of time during which member of staff must be offer an appropriate suitable post should their job role be at risk of redundancy that protect period apply to the mother for month after her child be bear to adoptive parent for month after their child arrive in england scotland or wales from overseas or the date on which the adoption placement start and for month for those take more than six week of share parental leave those be the only group of parent include in the extension to the protect period which mean that dad take paternity leave be leave out dad may benefit from the protection if they adopt child which be great or if they take more than six week of share parental leave but dad who take paternity leave have no such protection and that be obviously wrong in darlington dad and mum raise parental leave and dad right on the doorstep all the time pregnant then screwed estimate that mother year lose their job while pregnant or take maternity leave that be appalling and my hon and gallant friend act will protect woman from that utterly awful motherhood penalty he be right to take action to protect work mum however urge the government to take action to extend the protection to dad in the upcoming parental leave review clause directly amend the employment rights act to offer further protection to pregnant woman which be absolutely right once again the additional right extend to mum parent take adoptive leave and parent take share parental leave we rightly want those people to be protect the right also extend to bereaved father which be important but they do not extend to those take paternity leave in anticipation of the argument that dad can benefit from share parental leave want to outline why it do not work as policy or law five per cent of dad take share parental leave that be because it be bit of gimmick first the second partner most often the father of the child be more likely to take small share of the share parental leave which be often less than six week and therefore would not qualify for additional redundancy protection secondly and far to that argument share parental leave be itself policy that be tough on mother mother who want to go back to work should be able to do so and if they want to go back early and not use their full maternity right we obviously support that my view be not in conflict with the right of mother but be in addition to and in support of they share parental leave however be an anti mother policy and that be why only of father and partner take it father mother and baby need time together they need time to bond time to heal and time to adjust to the earth shatter experience of become parent together in practice dad who be often the breadwinner go dutifully back to work sleep deprive and under heavy societal pressure to provide for and protect their new family they have to keep that job and that be because so many woman face maternity discrimination absolutely appreciate the effort and scale of this landmark legislation and appreciate the vast reach scope of the measure it contain it will improve many life be pragmatist and be hopeful that we can get an increase in paternity pay for now however simply ask for parity for paternity for dad right seventy two per cent of the public support more protection for dad but only third of new dad take paternity leave something be badly wrong there and urge the minister to listen to the campaign group the dad shift which say that an estimate dad year who take paternity leave lose their job because of it my generation and those young than be the keen yet for more family time but their primary concern be pay the bill the rate of paternity leave the huge swathe of discrimination for return mother and the lack of protection mean that dad can not even take what they be entitle to we have to change that be proud of this bill and proud of our government and be very hopeful for dad refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests and declare that be proud member of the gmb stand to speak against amendment which would exclude the hospitality sector and sport venue from the bill duty for employer not to permit harassment of their employee the first time be harass at work be when be year old wait table at charity event the second time be when be in bistro except this time be be pay for the experience after that it be when be student work in bar then when work in canteen and then in warehouse it be because of that experience one share by people of both sex and all age but particularly the young and particularly woman across this country that be be not go to lie absolutely gobsmacke by the amendment table by the shadow secretary of state for business and trade the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith to the protection from harassment clause which would exclude those work in the hospitality sector or sport venue the conservative party be argue that some kind of harassment be okay and that if you be work in the hospitality sector or in sport venue it be fine tory seem to believe that if you go to pub your right to harass bar staff be great than their right not to be harass have to say that be quite an extraordinary thing to argue for but be glad that they be at least be honest with we job in hospitality often involve insecure work on low pay that be reliant on tip in margate ramsgate and broadstairs thousand of people work in job like that and do not see why it should be deem acceptable for they to be harass in their job but not people who work in an office refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests and be proud member of the gmb do my hon friend agree that even more concern be the call from the opposition benches and particularly from the former home secretary the right hon and learn member for fareham and waterlooville suella braverman for the equality act to be scrap which would mean that law cover sexual harassment and equal pay would be completely remove from the workplace this be really troubling agenda from the conservatives and believe it be in keep with this amendment be grateful to my hon friend for that intervention it be indeed very worrying direction of travel from the conservatives we on the labour benches think that people should not be allow to harass any worker honestly do not expect this to be controversial aspect of the bill for the conservatives perhaps be be uncharitable so would really appreciate it if the shadow secretary of state who be now in his place could answer few question when do it become conservative party policy to allow staff to be harass why do that apply only to staff work in hospitality and sport venue and not to all worker why be it all right to harass bar staff but not office staff know that the hon lady have not be in the chamber for most of the debate so she will have miss many of the discussion where my hon friend have explain the nuance of our position on this which relate to the law of unintended consequence where publican and nightclub owner could be responsible for police the word of their customer that be clearly not tenable situation but will repeat the word of all of my colleague on this side of the house sexual harassment be abhorrent we do not condone it in any shape or form and ask she to withdraw the insinuation that anyone on this side of the house have any truck with such behaviour would like to emphasise that listen closely to the opening speech when the hon lady colleague be talk about amendment hear clearly for example some confusion over whether sexual harassment be crime or civil offence so will not take any lesson from the conservatives on their understanding of employment law or indeed what be consider acceptable at work the amendment be utterly disgraceful be proud that this labour government have bring forward bill to stop worker be harass wherever they work it be just shame that the conservative party do not agree the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith and apparently the hon member for bognor regis and littlehampton alison griffiths think that it be wrong that pub landlord will have to be responsible for kick out customer he talk about it be banter ban but pub manager have always know the importance of keep rowdy behaviour in limit and protect their staff and customer from be pester or be make the unwilling butt of so call joke this law will the hon member give way no will not give way this law will strengthen their hand say in the word of the great pub manager of all time peggy mitchell to the proposer of the amendment get outta my pub quite call dr jeevun sandher what speech to follow can not quite claim to be peggy mitchell but will try to live up to that brilliant remark rise as proud member of the gmb happily refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests will speak to new clause and which relate to part of the bill they will strengthen the bargaining power of social worker and by do so create strong work relationship between employee and employer that both side will invest more in that mean high wage for those who look after our parent more training and healthy social care workforce both side will invest more both side will benefit more pro worker pro business pro growth that be what these amendment and this bill will achieve before enter this place be trade union rep and work with my colleague to help stop pay cut in my workplace worker speak with one voice mean happy and more productive workplace one voice to set out what it mean to increase productivity that be why this be pro growth bill social care worker be among the low pay in our economy one in six be legally pay less than the minimum wage little proper certification reward or recognition for skill mean that there be little training poor condition mean that almost half suffer from work relate stress low pay little progression and poor condition be the reason why third of social care worker leave the sector each year that be what this bill and these new clause will fix the adult social care negotiating body will mean more social care worker speak as one voice gain high wage well condition and more training those benefit do not just appear on payslip they mean less time spend worry about pay the bill and more time with our family and read to our child they make worker more productive and benefit employer they make life worth live those on the opposition benches say that life can not improve they have talk lot of fear instead of hope and the change we can achieve they will likely vote against our amendment and against the bill in do so they would deny their constituent well wage and indeed well life we can not simply sit back and hope that wage rise that training will magically appear or that condition will get well on their own we have to act to make it so the bill and the amendment do exactly that by give social care worker the power to speak with one voice to negotiate high wage well training and well condition benefit employee and employer pro worker pro business and pro growth that be what the bill stand for that be what stand for that be what we stand for draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests have be trade union activist for year and regional official have genuine sense of pride in see the bill make its way through parliament it be truly transformational and seek to address the imbalance that have exist in the workplace for far too long many of the amendment before we strengthen exist right so as to ensure that unscrupulous employer be unable to frustrate delay or act unreasonably when deal with their workforce either collectively or as individual other amendment such as new clause in my name seek to introduce new right and protection for group of worker who have hitherto be forget or overlook my new clause call for the establishment of regulatory body for foster carer currently those who employ foster carer local authority charity and independent foster agency also serve as de facto regulator with the power to register and de register worker that put too much power in the hand of the employer and accord to the foster carer branch of the independent workers union of great britain it illustrate structure within the sector that fail to bring consistency transparency fairness or decent outcome for the child and young people in their care new regulatory body would therefore accredit educational institution to provide standardised training course once complete those course would remain on carer work record at the moment every time foster carer start with new provider they be require to do the training again that be both unnecessarily costly and time consume the body would also be responsible for maintain central register of foster care worker and would ensure proper standard of care and deal with fitness to practice case as with the very good regulatory body it would include those with live experience of foster care one of the key role of that propose body would be to standardise the employment right available to carer such as maximum working hour entitlement to statutory sick pay and protection against unfair dismissal while also consider the important issue of collective sectoral bargaining through that we would hope to see improvement in pay minimum allowance holiday and pension entitlement as the uk continue to lose foster carer at an alarming rate now be the time for that basic oversight which will help to ensure we have enough safe and love home for the vulnerable child who need they my amendment to relate to the issue of redundancy over the year have negotiate with number of employer over hundred of redundancy and be seek to improve the legislation base on that first hand experience amendment would require an employer to hold meaningful consultation even if they be prepare to make few than staff redundant something that many good employer already do of course whereas amendment and would introduce great sanction for those who fail to consult properly amendment would treat worker dismiss under fire and rehire as have be make redundant and would ensure that they receive great remuneration as result amendment to all seek to improve the level of redundancy pay by remove the year cap on entitlement by ensure that someone with year and six month service for example receive year redundancy pay rather than by base the statutory redundancy calculation on month rather than week and by ensure those with less than two year service also have the right to redundancy payment of course there be many reason why redundancy occur but at the moment the rule and sanction around this issue enable some unscrupulous employer to exploit the situation and treat their staff unfairly these amendment seek to address that imbalance and hope the government will consider way in which the issue have highlight can be include in the legislation be proud trade unionist and refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests commend the minister and the deputy prime minister for introduce this landmark legislation as well as my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald who do huge amount of work on it as shadow minister all of they have dedicate their life to stand up for work people and this bill be culmination of that work and the work of trade unionist over many many year would like to speak in support of new clause my own experience of take time off work as an mp and the contrast with the experience of those on statutory sick pay make it clear just how badly reform be need some year ago when need to take leave of absence because of the severity of my post traumatic stress disorder symptom receive full pay and phase return but for many worker that be million mile from their experience the uk have some of the bad sick pay entitlement in europe the fact that the bill mean that sick pay will be pay from day one instead of after day three be very welcome as be the removal of the eligibility threshold increase access for more than million low pay worker however we must acknowledge that without increase the rate the low level of statutory sick pay will continue to place terrible burden on those who be already poorly pay that be why amendment table by my hon friend the member for bradford east imran hussain be so important those be far from the only issue another problem be the inflexibility of statutory sick pay and that be why have work with the mental health charity mind to table new clause more than million working age people have long term health condition and experience challenge at work statutory sick pay currently do not allow for proper phase return or for worker to reduce their hour during period of ill health statutory sick pay can only be pay for full day of sickness if worker need half day for instance ssp can not be use to cover the hour they be not work if we force people to return to work before they be ready whether that be because they can not afford to remain on statutory sick pay or because phase return be not an option for they they be far more likely to be trap in cycle of poor mental wellbeing and to fall out of work completely new clause would mean that sick pay be pay pro rata by hour rather than day to allow for that great flexibility year of successive government review have come to the same conclusion flexible statutory sick pay model would improve life and well support people to remain in work have appreciate ministers engagement with on this issue and hope the government will commit to look at it far especially as the cost to the government would only be administrative however the impact it would have on people life be huge the labour movement fight long and hard for the right to sick pay and proper support for those with long term illness and disability whether in work or not because our movement and our party exist to stand up for the whole of the work class at time when more people be affect by sickness and disability it be crucial that this government support they and do not scapegoat they for the failure and the political choice of the conservative party as young worker in the late experience the precarious nature of the world of work along with many of my peer lack of knowledge about our right and the fear of be sack if we complain about our term and condition politicise and make lifelong trade unionist and member of unite and unison wish to speak to new clause on roll up holiday pay for irregular hour worker and part year worker and new clause entitle working time regulations record which be table in my name like most colleague in this house and along with the trade union movement and the million of worker who will benefit from its provision warmly welcome the bill and thank everyone who have campaign for it long and hard the majority of people spend huge portion of their life in work work should be an opportunity to be fulfil to live fully to support ourselves and our family to develop as individual and to contribute to society in reality however for too long and for too many the world of work have be and be world of uncertainty and ruthless exploitation often strip people of their dignity and their worth for million there be struggle to obtain secure work and that strengthen the hand of employer to drive hard bargain to benefit their balance sheet and their profit for those who can secure work work life can remain unclear and insecure it can include irregular and uncertain employment uncertainty about hour payment and vital matter such as holiday pay and entitlement while other in the house boast of their endless push for so call flexible labour market the reality be very different for those on the other side of the employment contract for the worker the previous government speak about cut so call red tape when they really mean reduce people work right and strengthen the power of boardroom billionaire my proposed new clause be in relation to certain sector although they would benefit all worker it be widely know and acknowledge that some employer use so call roll up holiday pay as device to tackle their obligation to provide pay time off for holiday holiday and break from work be essential for worker and recognise factor in deliver an effective organisation in the public and private sector so call roll up holiday pay be mechanism by which an employer add holiday pay to basic pay throughout the working year but do not provide it separately at the time of take the holiday it be acknowledge include by acas that that create risk that worker may feel under pressure not to take any holiday or to take less holiday than they be entitle to that be particularly risk for those who work in sector of the economy where the work be irregular and along with that their work also tend to be lower pay the pressure on such worker be immense new clause seek to address that risk risk accept and address by ruling from the european court of justice new clause would ensure that working time be accurately record by employer colleague across the house may recall that the recordkeeping requirement under the working time regulations be water down by amendment table by the previous government in november follow the uk withdrawal from the eu they believe that it be too cumbersome to require employer to maintain accurate record on behalf of employee refer to it as time consume and disproportionate reporting what load of rubbish with advance in modern technology there be no excuse for an employer to fail to accurately and precisely keep record of the work time contribute by worker the onus of managing record should be shift from employee to allow they to focus on their own role without add administrative requirement this government employment rights bill will deliver new deal for work people and wholeheartedly support it but urge the minister to take account of the issue have raise and to accept new clause and which would strengthen the bill provision and increase protection for the section of worker who need it the most draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and be proud member of community it be an honour to speak as this landmark bill hopefully pass its next stage finally bring to an end an era of insecurity and low pay under the conservative party this landmark bill bring in day one right for worker fair pay agreement for social care worker and great entitlement to statutory sick pay my speech will focus on and highlight the way in which the bill and some of its amendment strengthen the right of care worker and carer the majority of whom be woman we have hear already in this debate many proposal from hon member on the government benches to go far than the excellent proposal before we to strengthen day one right for employee my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen speak movingly about pregnancy loss and bereavement and along with my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy talk about the need for strong entitlement to parental leave all of that will have really positive impact particularly on woman draw attention particularly to the day one right that strengthen flexible work by default invite the minister to consider give guidance to employer that they should require flexible working to be advertise the fawcett society have make particularly strong case for the importance of that for woman and know that that be also true for carer if before apply for job they do not know that they can secure that flexibility many will not even apply some of woman who be not currently work say that if flexible work be available to they it would enable they to do pay work so we be miss out on huge potential for business the fawcett society survey in say that of woman agree that they would be more likely to apply for job that advertise flexible working option while have have to turn down job offer when employer be unable to offer the flexible working that they need while the bill make excellent provision urge the minister to respond on how we can implement that in practice so that carer and particularly woman can have the confidence to apply for job and know that they can have those flexible working requirement thank the hon lady for her warm word about carer will she therefore support liberal democrat new clause which would make pay carer leave an entitlement the hon gentleman may know that be the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on carer we be very pleased that there be now unpaid leave requirement for carer on other occasion have urge the government to look into go far with pay entitlement for carer there be real opportunity to enable the million carer in pay employment to remain in employment and to stop the loss of an estimate people per day who leave work due to their caring responsibility while that be not part of this bill hopefully the government and the minister will respond to that that be the first area of the bill that really welcome the second which have huge benefit for care worker be its provision on pay and condition through pay agreement echo some of the comment make by my hon friend the member for loughborough dr sandher who be no long in his place about the huge benefit that these will bring to so many of our value adult social care staff the establishment of the new fair work agency will ensure that everyone be play by the same rule and strengthen power to deal with modern slavery and labour abuse will far extend protection to care worker many care worker have come to this country on overseas visa and have pay extortionate fee in their country of origin have find themselves tie into accommodation here on zero hour contract and be exploit by the care company as such the provision in the bill be very welcome we know that too many care worker live in poverty research by the health foundation suggest that one in five care worker can not afford the essential either for themselves or for their child be proud to be sit on the labour benches as we bring forward fair pay agreement along with the abolition of exploitative zero hour contract which will finally provide security for our value social care worker in implement these change it be really important that we establish framework to help home care worker in particular some of whom meet recently who be not pay for their travel time or their sleep in hour despite the fact that such practice should be illegal as we take forward the fair pay agreement in adult social care urge the minister to work with colleague to ensure it be accompany by an ethical charter for care provider to sign up to this government have already show how serious they be about value those who do so much to care for and provide support to disabled adult and old people in this country the third area want to mention which other colleague have talk about and which my hon friend the member for bradford east imran hussain have address in his new clause madam deputy speaker keep look at the clock believe there be an issue would you please advise on my remain time yes the clock have stop you start at pm but you do take an intervention so think you can go for one more minute thank you very much madam deputy speaker very briefly be delighted that the government be strengthen statutory sick pay during covid many care worker be force to go into work at their own risk and risk those they be care for because they be not eligible for statutory sick pay so strengthen it be an excellent move in conclusion this bill together with the propose government amendment and some of those suggest by my hon friend will ensure that the million people work in adult social care can get fair pay guarantee hour statutory sick pay and day one right it be good for worker and it be good for woman draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my unison membership welcome the bill which be once in generation chance to give more power to work people include those in ealing southall and support the government amendment to provide decent sick pay to million low pay worker do not support the opposition amendment which attempt to tie we up in knot in an effort to block work people from get the right they should be entitle to particularly want to consider the impact of the bill and the government amendment on disabled people currently almost million people be off work long term sick record high of course some of those be disabled people who be unable to work however there be also many disabled people who desperately want to work but who have be kick out of their job because their employer refuse to make simple change that would allow they to succeed in my previous role as national disability officer for the country big trade union unison we work with disability rights uk and scope to develop the disability employment charter that charter be list of improvement to help disabled people get and keep employment over employer both large and small sign up to say that they back the idea in the charter they back disabled worker right but the previous conservative government see it all as red tape they do not listen and they refuse to introduce those change they leave million of disabled people who want to work stuck on benefit and the opposition amendment today be just more of the same those employer that sign the disability employment charter and the many disabled worker who have be push out of their job will be hearten to see the change be introduce in the new employment rights bill many of those change implement the demand of the charter include allow flexible working more support for trade union disability rep and strengthen sick pay those employer would reject the opposition many amendment whose aim be to frustrate this support for disabled worker people be often surprised to learn that low pay worker be not entitle to statutory sick pay and that unless the employer company have its own scheme they can claim statutory sick pay only after three day of be ill during the pandemic that lead to social care staff in particular feel force to work when they have covid potentially pass the illness on lack of access to sick pay be public health issue and this new law will ensure that low pay worker no long have to choose between not be pay and go to work sick it will also give disabled worker time off to recover from illness rather than struggle into work become sicker and potentially fall out of employment for the long term be pay to take few day off to recover could save they and the economy lifetime of be leave on the scrapheap will my hon friend give way no because many member be wait to speak welcome government amendment to which specify the level of sick pay that low pay worker will now be able to expect from day one know that some employer want to pay bit less and trade union want bit more but be compromise certainly do not support the delay tactic of the opposition who have seek impact appraisal that already exist and show that these change will lead to an increase in productivity and growth if we can get disabled people work when they want to do so this transformative bill respond to key demand of the disability employment charter for default right to flexible working for many disabled worker the ability to organise their hour around take medication and deal with pain or fatigue will mean be able to keep their job rather than end up sick or be march out of the door in line with the charter this new law also introduce pay time off for trade union equality representative subject that know we will discuss tomorrow negotiate reasonable adjustment can take time and input from train person whose priority be to keep the worker in his or her job will make all the difference however unison research have establish that nearly quarter of disabled worker who ask their employer for reasonable adjustment wait year or more for help and some never even receive reply you can not do job that cause you pain or set you up to fail so it be no wonder that disabled people end up out of the door the disability employment charter call for new right to two week deadline for at least receive reply to reasonable adjustment request currently there be no deadline for such response although in the case of flexible working request the employer must respond within eight week have have constructive discussion with the minister for social security and disability my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms and be hopeful that we may see such deadline include in the get britain working plan which complement the bill many good employer already support disabled worker and pay tribute to the who have back the disability employment charter and right for those worker the bill and the government amendment will ensure that there be level playing field so that bad employer can not undercut those who want to do the right thing they will ensure that more disabled worker can keep job that they value and can contribute to the growth that we need to get our economy work again call alex sobel and ask he to keep his remark to four minute refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my year membership of the gmb union new clause which stand in my name would place duty on employer to investigate whistleblowe concern and establish internal channel for report and manage whistleblow disclosure in recent year we have see scandal rock the country in which whistleblower raise the alarm at an early stage only for their warning to be ignore and for disastrous consequence to follow scandal with thousand of victim such as the post office horizon case the grenfell tower fire tragedy and the collapse of carillion involve whistleblower raise the alarm only to face wall of silence we see the very bad of that at yorkshire cricket club in my constituency when azeem rafiq suffer year of racist harassment and abuse despite the number of player who admit to racist remark or action the club leadership refuse to accept their mistake and refuse to release the full report instead release an edit summary only when azeem appear before the culture media and sport committee do the full scale of institutional racism at the club become know these failure have tragic human cost and they often place significant strain on the taxpayer accord to the report the cost of whistleblowing failures the avoidable cost incur owe to the failure to listen to whistleblower in the post office horizon carillion and letby case be million it be unacceptable for the taxpayer to have to bear the burden of fail system and fail legislative framework which be why we need new legal duty on employer to investigate whistleblowing new clause would ensure that employer must take reasonable step to investigate any protect disclosure make to they it would compel large employer to establish internal channel and appropriate procedure for report by ensure that disclosure be investigate we can prevent scandal such as horizon from occur and ensure that harm in the workplace be deal with early the new clause be proudly pro worker and pro business and would tackle one of the long stand issue with our current whistleblowing legal framework for worker the status quo provide only an after the event remedy for whistleblower and this new clause would ensure that there be channel for whistleblower from the start yougov and protect research find that of worker want legal duty on employer to investigate whistleblowing concern and new clause would deliver on the long stand demand from worker in the light of recent scandal business be realise the value of whistleblower in help to root out wrongdoing and harm within their own company in its report on the post office scandal the institute of directors recommend that all employer should be require to meet standard for whistleblowing and follow recognise procedure new clause would require employer to take reasonable step mean that vexatious or insignificant concern would not always require an investigation this be once generation opportunity to revolutionise whistleblowe law the public interest disclosure act be groundbreake for its time but the uk have since fall behind our comparator jurisdiction such as the eu and japan on whistleblow protection hope that the government will consider support new clause or equivalent measure which would be good for worker business and taxpayer also hope that the minister will meet to discuss this matter follow today debate through this new clause we can take action to ensure that whistleblower be support that business be give the tool to root out wrongdoing and that taxpayer be spar from have to bail out state scandal draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and the fact that be proud trade union member give my full support to the measure in this landmark bill in derby we make thing from nuclear reactor that power submarine to the train car and aeroplane engine that get people and good where they need to go and food production operation that help put food on our table we do not just have large company with big economy of scale we also have thousand of small and medium sized company many business that have visit large and small be invest in their workforce want to pay they properly and want to provide stable secure work that enable their employee to build life and family but they want level playing field so that they be not undercut by competitor that do not play by the rule that avoid their responsibility and that exploit those who work for they when people be stick in insecure low pay work plan for their future be impossible it be wrong that so many people have no idea whether they will have five hour of work or in week wrong that they have no idea whether they will earn enough to pay their bill and wrong that they can have pay for childcare be on bus to work and get call say they be no long need what be shocking be that we have million people in irregular work such as those on zero hour or low hour contract or in agency job be proud that this government through this bill be take action to end exploitative zero hour contract and that amendment and will ensure that agency worker be also protect on second reading of this groundbreaking bill speak about the importance of enforcement right be not worth the paper it be write on unless it be enforce and the provision that we make the guidance that we set and the law that we pass be only as strong as the enforcement for part of my career as barrister have the honour of represent work people but always know that for the many who do seek justice through tribunal there be many who do not feel able to take action the low pay commission have find that low pay and exploit worker can be reluctant to speak out about abuse of their right last year we celebrate the anniversary of labour government bring in the national minimum wage but the low pay commission estimate that one in five worker receive it be not provide with the correct pay in on second reading call for the strengthening of the fair work agency which will enforce the national minimum wage statutory sick pay and wide range of right such as holiday pay so that everyone play by the same rule be hugely pleased to see that new clause have be table that would strengthen the power of the fair work agency as we will talk about tomorrow new clause would give the agency power to bring proceeding to an employment tribunal on behalf of worker that could make huge difference for worker and it help protect business from be undercut by act as real deterrent the soon that these measure be in place the soon enforcement can begin and justice can be deliver and this will bring we well protection well productivity and well growth first think need to mention that my hon friend the member for gateshead central and whickham mark ferguson be celebrate his birthday today and what great way to spend his birthday he be one of the people who have work tirelessly over many year in different guise to help we get where we be today give the number of speech and contribution it be just not go to be possible to pay tribute to everyone in the time have or indeed to reference every speech and every amendment but will do my good to cover as much as possible will start with my hon friend the member for nottingham east nadia whittome whose new clause relate to significant structural change to the statutory sick pay system think she make very personal and persuasive speech and agree with she that phase return to work be an effective tool in support people to stay in or return to work help to reduce the flow into economic inactivity and the cost to business of sickness absence by remove the wait period employee will be entitle to statutory sick pay for every day of work miss this well enable phase return to work for example by support someone who normally work five day week to work three day week be pay ssp for the other two day that simply would not have be possible under the exist system we be committed to continue to work closely with employee and employer to develop and implement system that be fair supportive and effective in kick start economic growth and break down barrier to opportunity and we will continue to have conversation about that turn to new clause from my hon friend the member for bradford east imran hussain pay tribute to he for his work as shadow minister in this area the change we be bring in through this bill mean that up to million low pay employee will now be entitle to statutory sick pay and all eligible employee will be pay from the first day of sickness absence benefit million of employee the new percentage rate be consistent with the structure use for other statutory payment it be simple to understand and implement and with the removal of waiting period the internal modelling from the department for work and pensions show that most employee even those who may nominally earn less per week will not be bad off over the course of their sickness absence believe the speech by my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh be she first from the back benches and do not think she will be on they for very long if she continue to make such contribution think it be an excellent speech and the way she speak about her constituent mr really hammer home the importance of tackle non disclosure agreement would like to pay tribute to her ongoing effort to ensure that victim of misconduct and bullying can speak up about their experience and get the help and support they need want to thank the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran for originally table the amendment and for meet last week to share sadly another horrific story about the abuse of nda also thank the hon member for bath wera hobhouse for her contribution in this area there be legitimate us of nda but want to be clear we have hear too many example of this today that they should not be use to silence victim of harassment or other misconduct understand that hon member want to ensure equal protection in relation to nda concern harassment across the economy and absolutely hear what they have say however we have to acknowledge that this would be far reach change and it would be to take significant step without properly engage with worker employer and stakeholder and assess the impact on sector across the economy want to reiterate that recognise that non disclosure agreement be an important question that warrant further consideration and we will continue to look at the issue raise my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley say that she want to go far and look forward to engage with she and with organisation such as ca buy my silence new clause in the name of the hon member for bridgwater sir ashley fox would give employee who be special constable the right to time off work to carry out their voluntary police duty join he in pay tribute to special constable who make an invaluable contribution to police across the country it would not be appropriate however to support additional legislation on this matter without comprehensive analysis on the impact such change could bring to policing as the hon gentleman know we debate it in committee and my official have be in discussion with colleague at the home office to learn more about the topic further engagement be continue with the staff association for special constable and the association of special constabulary officer recognise that the legislation be now half century old and need considerable look we can not support the amendment tonight but be glad that there be at least one member on the conservative benches who support increase employment right turn to new clause table by my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy want to start by recognise the key role that paternal leave play in support work family the arrival of child be transformative for all parent the government understand and value the vital role that father and partner play in raise child and we want to support they to do that commend my hon friend for her work in this area we already have statutory framework in place that guarantee eligible employ father and partner protect period of paternity leave ensure that they can not be require to work while claim that leave or be discriminate against by their employer for take it however recognise what my hon friend the member for darlington lola mcevoy say about the limitation on those protection also pay tribute to she for her work on this issue paternity leave be available to the father of the child or the mother partner irrespective of their gender and the leave can be take by the father or partner at any point in the first year follow the child birth or adoption acknowledge the wide point make by my hon friend the member for darlington which be that we need to do more to ensure that the parental leave system as whole support work family as government we have commit to do that recently meet the dad shift pregnant then screwed and working families to discuss that very issue through the bill we be make paternity leave and unpaid parental leave day one right mean that employee will be eligible to give notice of their intent to take leave from their first day of employment remove any continuity of service requirement that bring they both into line with maternity leave and adoption leave simplify the system we be also commit to review the parental leave system the review will be conduct separately from this bill work be already under way across government on plan for its delivery and will commence before royal assent we be scope the work already under way across the department for work and pensions the department for business and trade and the ministry of housing communities and local government we of course want and expect to engage widely with stakeholder as part of that review process and would expect my hon friend the member for walthamstow to engage with we in that respect new clause table by my hon friend the member for leeds east richard burgon would partially reinstate to the equality act similar measure that be sponsor by the previous labour government this government continue to have sympathy with its aim we all know that the statutory questionnaire be sometimes find to be helpful informative tool while the government will not support new clause we will be give close consideration to the impact of the repeal of the statutory questionnaire and any step that may be need during this parliament be very pleased to hear confirmation that the review into parental right which understand will begin in june will go ahead the minister talk about stakeholder will he confirm whether they will include our trade union colleague because many of we be very happy to withdraw our amendment tonight on the basis that work people can be part of the conversation would fully expect we to consult with all relevant party so do not think my hon friend need have any worry in that respect pay tribute to two people who have be instrumental in shape our thought on this issue my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald and my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne they table amendment on employment status it be important to say that we be take action in respect of those who work for umbrella company we have be clear that some reform in the plan to make work pay will take long to undertake and implement we see consult on simple two part framework as long term goal but assure they both that remain committed to that also hear what my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east say in relation to his concern about fire and rehire we will be look very closely at how our reform work in practice new clause seek to create legal definition of kinship care to be use to establish eligibility for kinship care leave new clause aim to establish new kinship care leave entitlement for employ kinship carer with minimum of week of leave available for eligible employee be pleased to say that the government children wellbeing and schools bill will for the first time create legal definition of kinship care for the purpose of specific measure in the bill by define kinship care in law the legislation will ensure that all local authority have clear and consistent understanding of what constitute kinship care be also pleased to say that the government have recently announce million package to trial new kinship allowance this be the single big investment make by this government in kinship care to date and will enable child to be raise within their community by their extended family new clause another liberal democrat new clause table by the hon member for torbay steve darling which we debate in committee would commit the government to introduce an entitlement for employee with caring responsibility to be pay their usual wage while take carer leave while we have stress the government commitment to support employ unpaid carer and have be engage with ministers and relevant body on the matter the carer leave act only recently give employ carer new right to time off work to care for dependant with long term care need so we be review this measure and consider whether further support be require recognise that many of their amendment and new clause come from good place but the liberal democrats have to decide whether they be go to be manchester united or manchester city their speech be litter with concern about the increase in cost from the bill yet every new clause and amendment seem only to add to those cost understand that they be come from good place but they have to decide whether or not they support the bill hope they can make that decision before tomorrow night at least the liberal democrats be here unlike the new kid on the block who be absent from the benches behind they pay tribute to they for actually turn up today will now address the point raise by the opposition on harassment as set out in amendment and in the name of the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith those amendment seek either to exclude the hospitality sector and sport venue from the bill obligation for employer not to permit the harassment of their employee by third party or to remove clause altogether thus deprive employee of protection from all type of harassment by third party under the equality act let we be clear this government be commit to make workplace and working condition free from harassment and we must therefore protect employee from third party harassment want to underline two important point in relation to clause first on the expectation it place on employer would like to assure the house that employer can not and be not expect to police or control every action of third party instead employer simply need to do what be reasonable what be reasonable will of course depend on the specific circumstance of the employer far the step that an employer can reasonably take in respect of the action of third party in its workplace be clearly more limited than the step it can take in respect of its employee and employment tribunal will of course take that into account when consider the fact of the case the second point relate to the threshold for what constitute harassment far too often have hear objection to clause implying that employer will be liable if their staff be offend by comment make by third party which be not the case at all fact reflect think by the conservatives support similar measure in the previous parliament in his opening remark the shadow minister ask what evidence there be that this clause be need the nhs staff survey for reveal that quarter of all staff have suffer harassment bullying or abuse from patient or service user while unite survey say that of its member have suffer third party harassment presumably that be why ukhospitality in its write evidence to the bill committee say that it support the measure in principle will work with they to ensure that we protect everyone in the sector because believe that everyone who work in this country deserve protection from harassment think it be incredible that the opposition can not see problem with argue against that will turn to new clause on substitution clause which be table by the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy think it be fair to say that we be aware of the risk have be work closely with the minister for border security on illegal working by irregular migrant in the gig economy and the role that substitution clause play in facilitate that we will continue to work closely with the home office on this issue the opposition also table new clause which seek to require the secretary of state to have regard to the uk international competitiveness and economic growth when make any regulation under part and of the bill the government be already laser focused on this key objective our plan to make work pay be pro growth package and set out an ambitious agenda to deliver our plan for change by ensure that employment right be fit for modern economy empower work people and contribute to economic growth the plan will bring the uk back into line with our international competitor and directly address our low growth low productivity and low pay economy interruption conservative members may be laugh but they be the people who deliver that economy for so many year international competitor and growth be at the heart of what we do we will pay close attention to the potential impact as we develop regulation to implement the measure in the bill on small business support remind member that have meeting with representative from inkwell who say that introduce these change will help create happy and productive workplace and create level playing field for employer that be exactly what we want to achieve with the bill we understand that the good business want to look after their staff and that treat they well be good for business good for worker and good for the wide economy the opposition narrow view seem to be that anything that be good for worker be automatically bad for business we absolutely reject that analysis in conclusion give people baseline of security and respect at work be fundamental it be clear that we need change from the system where people do not know what hour they will get from one week to the next where people with caring responsibility never get the same benefit of flexibility as their employer where minority of rogue employer can fire and rehire at will and where care worker and teaching assistant have all be undervalue for far too long it be time to end these injustice it be time to make work pay debate interrupt programme order this day the deputy speaker put forthwith the question already propose from the chair standing order no that the clause be read second time question agree to the deputy speaker then put forthwith the questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be conclude at that

adjournment debate today be march and on every march since the dreadful bombing in madrid in it have be the european remembrance day for victims of terrorism this occasion give we the opportunity to reflect on terror and the innocent victim of terror it give the house the opportunity to reflect on the impact that act of terror have have on the institution of the house of commons when be elect in enter parliament alongside jo cox who be memorialise behind she be cut down by far right extremist serve for many year with david amess and have great relationship with he and he be strike down by an islamic terrorist when you look to either side of the chamber madam deputy speaker you will note that under the door there be three heraldic plaque one to robert bradford one to ian gow and one to airey neave all of whom be serve parliamentarian when they be cut down by irish republican terrorist it be little known that behind your chair madam deputy speaker there be two further plaque one to sir anthony berry who be kill in the brighton bomb by irish republican terrorist and one to sir henry wilson first world war hero and latterly an irish unionist member of parliament who be cut down by irish republican terrorist occasion like this give we the opportunity to reflect but it be important for we as parliamentarian to consider what we can do in the good interest of those we represent and the legacy in northern ireland continue to be sore that have not heal the scar remain among community of whatever constitutional aspiration who have be affect by the onslaught of terror that we face be privileged to sit on the northern ireland affairs committee but be even more privileged last week alongside colleague who be present in the chamber today to meet number of organisation that represent the interest of innocent victim we meet the trust and we meet victim at the wave trauma centre we meet victim represent by the south east fermanagh foundation seff which be an organisation that work on behalf of fermanagh and enniskillen victim the most profound thing that they say to we be that within their county of fermanagh people be of they by republican terrorist and none by loyalist the people of fermanagh do not turn to take the law into their own hand they put their trust and faith in law and order and in the part of our state that be there to protect we that be most profound because there be no other county in northern ireland where that can be say there be one recur theme throughout the engagement that we have during the course of those two day victim want truth and justice commend my right hon friend for bring forward this issue his passion for victim be long stand and admirable do he agree that we need to set in stone the truth about victim in northern ireland for all the attention that be give to of victim the family of the suffer in silence will this day ensure that true victim story be tell and remember without any whitewashing whatsoever appreciate the intervention because there be task on the part of the government with the legislation they be consider at the moment on storytelling reconciliation and the narrative that people wish to share their truth must be tell and their truth know thank the right hon member for give way know his time be precious want to associate myself with the remark he make about member of this house who be lose and about the move visit we have last week with victim in belfast and fermanagh in relation to people who be murder by perpetrator from various side of the conflict it show their continue pain and their fortitude as the opening week of the omagh inquiry have do the sdlp support parallel dublin inquiry on that do the right hon member agree with that in the current legacy discussion moment an opportunity be come when we can assert that the need of victim not those of perpetrator have primacy and that we can not afford to squander that opportunity be very grateful for the intervention from the hon lady think she be right that we can not squander the opportunity but for too long now have hear voice within the government say that the one thing the party of northern ireland can agree on be their opposition to the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act but for very different reason very often we do not get the opportunity to fully explore those very different reason and for our part we will never stand in the way of justice and we will always support innocent victim thank the right hon member for secure this important debate on such move subject too be very honoured to go with he and other member of the northern ireland affairs committee to visit seff in fermanagh last week and it be profoundly move do he agree with that as part of deal with this legacy truth justice and reconciliation must be intentional part of the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery go forward it be interesting to hear the reflection of some who say why do need to reconcile ve be blow up ve be shoot ve lose my father my mother my sister my brother why be the onus on to reconcile should be honour for the sacrifice that ve make or be force to go through but where be somebody come along to say sorry you do not deserve what occur to you or your family member you do need to live through the pain and you do deserve the scar that you bear so agree with the hon member entirely that much more focus be require on reconciliation as someone who have the honour of host an event on this day for all the year be member of the northern ireland assembly commend the right hon member for secure this debate however do he agree with that one of the most abiding and insidious hurt to victim of terrorism be the constant glorification of those who make they victim particularly when it come to those who sit in government in northern ireland by their attendance at event commemorate those who be the man of blood and who deliver death and destruction on our street be that not one of the most hateful and insidious thing that can be do to victim with the re traumatisation that it bring be very grateful to the hon and learn member have two thing to say to he on that first be glad he organise for year think an event at stormont to mark european remembrance day for victims of terrorism such an event also occur yesterday so his legacy live on and be pleased to attend it as have on many occasion in the past secondly the hon and learn member be absolutely right yesterday have the opportunity to meet again we meet last week but meet again yesterday margaret veitch and ruth blair who lose love one in the enniskillen bomb reflect with they and it resonate so much with this point on the glorification of terror particularly from those who have responsibility to live by the nolan principle and to fulfil the political office they hold yet who attend commemoration and glorify those who revel in terror the excuse they always use be we have right to remember our dead that be what they say they have right to remember their dead margaret and ruth lose family member by simply turn up to remember their war dead on remembrance sunday in enniskillen yet they hear their political leader say we do this because we have an entitlement to remember our war dead margaret and ruth and their parent be offer no opportunity to remember rightfully those who make the sacrifice for freedom in our country be very grateful to the right hon gentleman he talk of truth and justice he will be aware that the northern ireland sentences act mean that if prosecution carry on no one will serve more than two year in jail if prosecution carry on people will do everything they can to cover up the truth in defend themselves when people criticise the legacy act which do propose truth and reconciliation commission be they not really criticise measure that would have give they much well opportunity for the truth to come out once the threat of prosecution be remove give that the punishment would not fit the crime even if someone be find guilty the right hon gentleman know that have high regard for he we explore these issue at great length when he chair the defence committee and be but lowly member of it the truth be that there be hundred if not thousand of individual in northern ireland who have be prosecute already how often do we see they go to meet their victim or the family of their victim how often do we see they try to apply balm on the wound that have never heal and those be the individual who have receive justice start to talk about truth and justice before the explosion of intervention they be important for this debate for the last number of year the terminology from this chamber have be very clearly you not go to get justice but we can offer you truth and the only way you can get truth be if we deny justice that be what the legacy act present to the people of northern ireland that be why we oppose it they want justice they want their day in court they have have to suffer evasion of justice in northern ireland for decade we do not support the belfast agreement because of the release of prisoner we do not support the notion that those who take life could be sentence for two year sentence for much long but only have to serve two year nor do we support on the run letter nor do we support amnesty for terrorist throughout the labour government proposal or the conservative government proposal because the approach that deny justice be one that will never allow the wound to heal want to reflect on number of institution we have that be suppose to aid justice truth and reconciliation in northern ireland one of they be the office of the police ombudsman for northern ireland which be establish to allow member of the community who do not support the police to buy into the police to get confidence in the police yet be sorry to say in this debate today that we have police ombudsman in whom have no confidence none whatsoever we have police ombudsman who construct the notion of collusion she be strike down by the court so she construct the notion of collusive behaviour she be strike down by the court more recently she have be miss in action she be fit to do the job she be unfit to do the job she be be investigate by the west midlands police herself yet whether she be obstruct in her role or not will raise one family one gentleman alan black alan black be workman who be out to work with his colleague all of they bar one be protestants in in kingsmill all bar one be attack by the ira when ask to identify themselves the one individual who identify himself as catholic be allow to leave eleven of alan colleague be murder that day for no other reason than that they have protestant faith alan survive he go to the police ombudsman look for answer on the investigation year ago he have an inquest which conclude month ago we hear from the ombudsman office that it be ready to report but month later there have still be no outcome no publication and no report for alan alan be an old man now he be an ill man because of the attack he have suffer greatly yet he put his faith in the organisation in which he and member of our community should be able to have confidence and he have receive nothing the omagh inquiry start five week ago the first four week be testimony from the family who lose someone so tragically that day four month after the belfast agreement be sign four month after when society be mean to be bask in people and two unborn baby be kill that day in omagh the inquiry have cross border dimension when the court in belfast say in that there should be an inquiry in omagh they say there also need to be one in the republic of ireland because the bomb be construct in the republic of ireland and be plant by provisional ira bomb team who be operate from the republic of ireland travel from the republic of ireland and escape to the republic of ireland the hon member for belfast south and mid down claire hanna indicate her support for such an inquiry in the south it be for this reason that answer be require what do we have so far reluctance on the part of the irish government there be nothing new in that the irish government have singularly fail to do anything on legacy apart from criticise the british government for the past year during the trouble they allow people to hide in the irish republic armed people in the irish republic and would not extradite terrorist from the irish republic yet today they stand and look square in the eye the family of the omagh victim and say we be sorry we be not go to do that for you we be not go to give you answer the same bomb team responsible for omagh be responsible for bombing in and whether it be in banbridge portadown lisburn newry or moira right throughout northern ireland they be make their mark and make their voice hear in the run up to peace negotiation it be an outrage that the irish government still stand back and say they will not provide an inquiry be disgrace they have offer honey word for year yet they do nothing to aid the sorrow they will not provide the condition that would allow we to challenge garda dermot jennings who be accuse of have say we will let one more through lad because he know the bombing team who be go to challenge and question the irish intelligence official and ask they the question our inquiry can not do it because it do not have the power know the government be consider memorandum of understanding with the irish government and that be important however if that do not allow for the production of people as well as paper it will never work it be why there have to be an inquiry in the republic of ireland too and be glad there be broad support for that the committee on the administration of justice in northern ireland with which struggle madam deputy speaker publish brilliant report in the last four week castigate the irish republic for its total failure to do anything on legacy over the past year it have no legacy body no legacy investigation unit no historical enquiry team and no ombudsman service it have no infrastructure whatsoever to answer question on legacy and no infrastructure whatsoever to aid the healing of the past what concern many people in northern ireland be that often when thing happen in northern ireland that be of particular disposition the republic of ireland government will weigh in heavily to press our government to do certain thing however it seem that on many occasion when thing happen on which our government should make representation to the republic government they fail adequately to do so my hon friend be absolutely right at summit last week not one word on these issue emerge save the irish government say they be not yet quite ready to withdraw their challenge against the british government for the legacy act they rule against an amnesty be provide just as we do but they decide to challenge their near neighbour in the british government through the european court they decide to do that without try to address these issue yet when the onus be on they when the shoe be on the other foot they offer nothing just this evening the northern ireland assembly pass motion to say that the irish government should hold an inquiry into omagh and agree it be amend by the dup and unanimously support by every party in stormont that be message that hope that the minister will take to the irish government about the strength of feeling on this issue we look lot of victim in the eye last week but we can not continue year after year to look victim in the eye and say nice thing but offer no hope offer no truth and offer no justice let briefly mention that motion that have just take be debate in the assembly which be secure by the ulster unionist party and amend by the dup we often hear in this place that when all party stand together in the northern ireland assembly the government will react will the right hon gentleman join in ask the minister to respond to that debate mr robinson there be nine minute remain of this adjournment debate thank you madam deputy speaker take that intervention because it be powerful point and be grateful for your latitude be delighted that the minister be here this evening hope that she respond positively hope that she recognise the pain and the anguish as she herself have meet individual in northern ireland there be long way to go on provide the answer the truth and the justice we will not be find want and hope the labour government will not either it be pleasure to respond to this important debate this evening congratulate the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson on secure it and on speak so eloquently and powerfully on what be for so many people painful and difficult subject as the right hon member describe act of terrorism in the united kingdom have have devastating and unimaginable impact on the individual family and community affect indeed that violence have be bring to our very doorstep and we stand in solemn remembrance of the member of this house take from we by act of terrorism while represent their constituent most recently as the right hon member mention they include jo cox brutally murder in and sir david amess brutally murder in both die while serve their constituent know they both as the right hon member do and miss they and feel their loss very personally those whom we have sadly lose to terrorism be forever remember by their family by their love one

over people be kill by terrorist during the course of the trouble behind every individual murder be the countless family member and other whose life be change forever by unthinkable loss in heartbreaking circumstance have listen to many of those harrowing story personally recent research remind we that as many as of people in northern ireland have conflict relate trauma and that this can be pass down the generation too and we must never forget that thankfully today northern ireland be place of relative peace and stability however the threat from terrorism remain with the current threat to northern ireland from northern ireland relate terrorism assess as substantial wish to pay tribute to the police service of northern ireland and the security service that continue to work tirelessly to keep we safe have the privilege of attend the police federation for northern ireland award last week in belfast to celebrate and honour the bravery of some of the exceptional officer who put their life on the line for we every day in northern ireland many group mark day of reflection on june to acknowledge the pain and suffering cause by the trouble and reflect on what more we can do sadly memorial remembrance and commemoration can be challenging and even divisive that be why this government in seek to address the legacy of the trouble be commit to bring forward memorialisation strategy to support inclusive structure and initiative to help all in northern ireland include future generation to reflect on those lose and we will continue to work to support those civil society group that be work tirelessly to promote reconciliation the right hon member mention seff and the wave trauma centre which come to westminster many be the subject of portrait in the silent testimony exhibition by colin davidson which be in the national portrait gallery recommend member pay visit there thank the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson secure this debate as part of the northern ireland affairs committee meet victim from all side last week but especially want to highlight the incredible work of wave in support victim of terrorism do the minister agree that those organisation be crucial for support victim from all side and we should do all we can to support they agree and be glad that wave and seff have be mention this evening nhs service be also vital for specialist trauma counselling such as the regional trauma network which visit with minister nesbitt on the legacy act acknowledge and address the suffering of victim of violence be an important aim of the belfast good friday agreement but agree that the task remain incomplete the government take their responsibility to victim and survivor of the trouble extremely seriously which be why we have be work with victim survivor and all interested party to correct the mistake of the last government and to put in place measure that will provide answer accountability and acknowledgment for family who have wait too long already in december the secretary of state for northern ireland lay draft remedial order to correct several of the human right deficiency of the legacy act include remove the bitterly opposed conditional immunity scheme which would have grant immunity from prosecution for those who carry out the most appalling terrorist crime the secretary of state will introduce primary legislation that will reform and strengthen the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery the right hon member for belfast east refer to the police ombudsman for northern ireland the government be pleased that the ombudsman recently return to work follow an extended period of absence it would not be appropriate for to comment on the legal proceeding but for family who be wait to receive the ombudsman report understand the concern and frustration with publication delay many family have already encounter too much delay in seek information and accountability know that the ombudsman office be do all that it can to publish report will the minister give way be afraid do not have time because want to respond to the issue that the right hon member for belfast east raise the right hon member rightly highlight that number of trouble relate case have cross border dimension include the kingsmill murder which be an appalling example of the pain and suffering inflict on civilian during the trouble it be right to acknowledge that the implementation of truly holistic legacy mechanism which can provide family across the uk and ireland with as much information as possible about the circumstance of their particular case will require the co operation of both the uk and irish government to facilitate the disclosure of information hold by authority in both jurisdiction this government consider the irish government to be an essential partner in the process of seek way forward on legacy issue that be human right compliant and can command public confidence across community turn to the omagh bombing inquiry last month commemorative hearing be painful reminder of the impact of cowardly terrorist action on community and family victim do not need hearing
