business before questions lords motion make that the bill be now read second time object bill to be read second time on tuesday may oral answers to questions energy security and net zero the secretary of state be ask electricity bills standing charge what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his department policy of recent trend in level of stand charge for electricity bill we know that consumer be frustrate by stand charge which be why we be commit to lower they ofgem have be consult on introduce zero stand charge tariff that would shift the cost on to unit rate the consultation have now close and we will be work with ofgem to take this forward have the department assess whether the rise standing charge be discourage resident in our constituency from switch to heat pump and electric vehicle because they be concerned about the fix cost that will come with they there be fix cost within standing charge relate to for instance the cost of maintain and upgrade network which we have to cover but we recognise the imbalance between the price that people be pay for electricity and the price that they be pay for gas we be committed to deal with that imbalance because we think it right that consumer can transition to clean heat that be the way in which we reduce the amount of energy we use and critically that be the way in which we reduce bill renewable energy sector job creation what step he be take to support job creation in the renewable energy sector what step he be take to support job creation in the renewable energy sector since the last oral question in march the government have consent to the rampion offshore wind farm create job reach the final investment decision on the hynet carbon capture utilisation and storage cluster create job invest million through great british energy in uk clean energy supply chain shortlist hydrogen company for hydrogen allocation round and create new million fusion investment fund this government be build the clean energy future in britain the reason be here on that saturday when parliament be recall be because some of the mighty structure in the north sea be make from british steel at the nigg yard on the question of renewable may ask the secretary of state what we be do about get out the skill to fabricate float offshore wind structure in the united kingdom that be very much part of our plan as the hon gentleman will know in march we announce the provision of more than million for the expansion of port of cromarty firth to create offshore wind supply chain in this country and last week along with gb energy we announce that investment of million in supply chain we be determined not just to generate offshore wind in britain but to take advantage of the huge economic opportunity that it represent hear what the secretary of state be say but scotland decline oil and gas industry have lose of their job in the past decade and today grangemouth have warn that it may have to pause important project involve switch to greener and more sustainable form of energy because of what it describe as soar energy bill and the pressure of income tax we know that grangemouth need investment but it also need more than the government be do at the moment what intervention be they plan to protect job and the community that could be hollow out if grangemouth be not save as the hon lady will know we inherit this situation from the last government but we set aside million to build the future in grangemouth and we be work closely with the scottish government on precisely that in government to government collaboration as for the hon lady wide question about industrial energy price we should obviously look at what different sector be say lot of nonsense be be talk about steel uk steel have say categorically that the difference between our price and those of continental europe be result of our reliance on natural gas power generation interruption opposition member say rubbish but that be what uk steel have say and that be why our clean power mission be right for family and right for business today mark the end of more than century of refining at grangemouth scotland be once again victim of industrial vandalism and devastation and do not want anyone in this chamber to dare mention just transition because we all know that the conservatives when they be in power and the scottish national party currently in holyrood have do nothing to avert this catastrophic decision put it to the secretary of state that during the general election campaign the labour leadership say that they would step in and save the job at the refinery what have change and why have we not do the sensible thing for scotland energy security my hon friend be talk about very important issue and grangemouth have very important role in scotland what will say to he and to other be that as soon as this government see the situation that they have inherit they put money in to help the worker and they have make that huge investment commitment of million work hand in hand with the scottish government so that we can build the future in grangemouth we be absolutely committed to build the future for grangemouth community and we look forward to work with my hon friend and other member on both side of the house to do that yesterday be international workers memorial day at service this weekend in falkirk grangemouth refinery worker rightly call for oil and gas worker skill not to be consider obsolete but utterly essential for the just transition what consideration have minister give to the urgent policy recommendation in project willow to provide accelerated investment in clean energy infrastructure and the job it promise for grangemouth my hon friend who be also really powerful advocate for his constituent be absolutely right project willow be leave on the shelf by the previous government we put the money in to take project willow forward and we be now go to implement it absolutely crucial to that be ensure the skill of oil and gas worker be properly use in the future include with the skill passport which also lie dormant under the previous government and which we be power ahead with call the liberal democrat spokesperson through my work on the select committee have hear repeat concern from industry leader that exist worker in their and see no point in retraining because they believe they will see out their career support old technology that have knock on impact on young entrant to the workforce who have traditionally learn their skill from more experienced worker will the secretary of state outline what step he be take to incentivise retrain to support growth in the renewable energy sector the hon lady raise really important point that be why we be work with the department for education to make sure we do not just have clean power plan that will help to create hundred of thousand of job across the country and invest in supply chain which talk about early but crucially offer opportunity for young worker and inspire they about the possibility that be available and create opportunity for old worker too all that work be ongoing in government un climate change conference what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the uk priority for the un climate change conference we be work closely with the brazilian presidency to support high ambition outcome at in belém which reflect the scale of the challenge and our share goal that include ambitious new nationally determined contribution and the effective implementation of the global stocktake commitment as well as action on issue such as tackle deforestation and methane emission it be encouraging to see the prime minister commitment to go far and fast towards net zero at the international energy summit last week because not take action on climate change will cost we much more do the minister agree that clean energy be not only good for the planet but can give my constituent in bedford and kempston energy security and low bill my hon friend be right other country be look to we the conference last week be good example of we be back in the business of global leadership whether it be through the global clean power alliance or our national mission to be clean energy superpower we be spearhead the transition because it be cheap clean and more secure his constituent will benefit from that too welcome the announcement make only few day ago that the government will adopt the amendment to the great british energy bill to prevent slave make good mean that they will not be balance their environmental conscience on the back of some of the world most endanger and troubled individual in the uyghur population in xinjiang will the government extend that to the private sector to make sure no slave make good be come into the uk in new ash green and ridley in my constituency solar panel farm be be put in that not only threaten the environment but threaten to bring in slave make good into the united kingdom would dispute that it be threaten the environment but we will be look at the wide issue the right hon gentleman raise through the solar industry taskforce call the chair of the select committee the overwhelming majority of those at the international energy summit last week say that the transition to low carbon energy be crucial to energy security do my hon friend agree that those in this chamber and beyond who do not support the transition to low carbon energy be play fast and loose with this country energy security that be absolutely the case it be hearten to see so many country and so many representative from business come together at the conference last week we be show global leadership on this issue we know it be the way forward in term of our energy security and not put we at the mercy of dictator and petrostate thank my hon friend for his support give the sheer scale of the outage in portugal and spain over the past few day be it likely that the conference will consider and possibly conclude that there be some correlation between the obsession with net zero and what happen in portugal and spain first of all be sure the whole house will want to send support to spain and portugal follow the incident yesterday there be no effect in the uk but we will continue to closely monitor the situation and any lesson learn from this event be not go to speculate as to its cause but we do need to ensure that our own system be as resilient as possible climate change international leadership what step he be take to establish international leadership on climate change what step he be take to establish international leadership on climate change international leadership on climate change be critical for this government which be why we announce world lead nationally determine contribution at and be at the heart of negotiation during the summit have be work extensively with international counterpart to ensure maximum ambition from country around the world at and look forward to further engagement recently receive letter from year child at ss peter and paul primary school express concern over the impact of climate change on their future mention the extreme weather and the destruction of our natural habitat for our wildlife the uk warm year on record have all occur since and be the uk hot year with temperature exceed for the first time despite be eight to nine year old they give suggestion for how the government could help by provide clean source of energy such as make solar panel more affordable will the secretary of state reassure and those pupil that we be do everything we can to be world leader in tackle climate change and to sustain the future for our child be glad to hear that the child at ss peter and paul primary school be take such an interest in this issue can assure they that we be do all we can to make britain clean energy superpower such as lift the onshore wind ban and set up great british energy and we be protect nature too we be also commit to engage more with young people and will make sure my hon friend be keep inform of our plan it be welcome indeed to see the government now play lead role internationally on climate action through the global clean power alliance especially after decade of failure that leave we expose to soar gas price it be also great to see the secretary of state stand up to climate denier in this house whose hostility to net zero would keep bill high and cost area like mine the job and investment that they need one area where we need strong leadership be on fund climate action fairly in the come day will be introduce bill to make the big polluter pay for the action we need both at home and abroad do not expect the minister or the secretary of state to comment on bill they have not see but will the secretary of state commit to meeting between his department and broad group of charity and non governmental organisation work to ensure fair and just climate financing welcome my hon friend support for the government climate leadership we be do all we can to mobilise climate financing in support of the new collective goal agree at would be more than happy to meet he and campaigner to discuss his bill when he be ready to do so one area where we could show significant leadership be in the sphere of float solar which come with huge benefit my constituency have acre of raise reservoir where we keep half of london drinking water you can not see the top of they mr speaker float solar be twice as efficient as land base system and come with none of the opportunity cost of put solar panel on grade agricultural land in fact float solar panel actually improve the water quality underneath so that thames water would have to use less filtration downstream hear however that the government solar road map have disappointingly little about float solar would the secretary of state agree to meet to discuss this far prior to publication as understand it the solar road map have not yet be publish so watch this space have be have conversation in the past couple of week with international counterpart who be interested in float solar and would be happy to get the hon gentleman more detailed response on our plan on that front as the minister know global leadership be about adaptation and mitigation do she expect the climate change committee report on adaptation which be due out tomorrow to say that the government be do enough in this regard furthermore will she show real leadership by require local authority and major infrastructure provider to carry out climate risk assessment so that statutorily they will have to ensure that climate resilience and preparedness form part of their plan can not pre empt what be in the report we will wait for it to come out and then respond in due course on local leadership the hon lady and share local authority and would be very happy to discuss with it what more we can do to set an example as bristol have do so many time in the past on how thing can be do at local level call the shadow minister as we have see in portugal and spain renewable energy can sometimes be unreliable give the dominant role that china play in our renewable energy infrastructure will the minister set out for the house the full detail of the deal that the secretary of state sign in secret with the chinese government my right hon friend the secretary of state assure that the deal be not sign he will keep the house inform as and when it be appropriate to do so domestic energy bills transparency what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the transparency of domestic energy bill costing under ofgem current rule supplier must provide complete and accurate billing information critically bill be require to be display in plain and accessible language we will work with the regulator to ensure that supplier abide by that however it be worth say that we recognise that many consumer feel let down by broken energy system that be not work on their behalf that be why we be review the role of ofgem to ensure that it have the power necessary to be an effective consumer champion when it come to bill the public understand what unit cost be but not what standing charge be when raise this with the previous government and ofcom they say that it be complex matter but what be ask for be transparency so that people understand how the charge be make up and can then make judgment on what it look like will the government commit to ask ofgem to ensure that that information be include in the billing so that we can see the breakdown of cost how much be go on human resource and how much be go on the actual infrastructure and wire so we know exactly what be go on in the energy market we support transparency ofgem publish the breakdown of all cost within bill but there be more that we need to do to ensure that consumer understand what be go on critically for we we know that consumer be very frustrated about the standing charge which be why we be commit to lower they as have say consultation be under way around what we do with standing charge which include introduce zero stand charge tariff within that we will be consider option to increase transparency many household in rural and coastal area include in south east cornwall be not connect to the gas grid and rely on alternative fuel which often cost they more what step be the minister take to ensure that unlike under the previous government these resident be not leave behind in future support scheme we be very clear that every part of the country must benefit from this transition so whether it be through our warm home scheme or the work that we be do locally through great british energy we be make sure that there be solution for every single part of the country in my department be do lot of work to make sure that we have set of proposition for household in rural area so that they can upgrade their home and have bill that be cheap and home that be warm which be the central plank of our warm home scheme call the shadow minister several time now have ask ministers to rule out align the british carbon price with the european one and each time they have refuse to do so they have already abandon their promise to cut energy bill by year but alignment would increase wholesale cost and therefore increase bill for every family in the country can the minister at last be straight with the public and tell we whether the government plan to match the european carbon price yes or no we be engage with industry on this matter the confederation of british industry and energy uk be clear that they should support alignment but we be look at that ultimately we be do everything that we can to bear down on energy cost in this country that be why we be sprint to clean power we inherit an absolutely atrocious legacy from the conservative party which allow business and consumer to bear the price of broken system we will not make the same mistake which be why we be crack on with the job think we be get close to the government admit their secret plan as soon as the local election be do labour be go to sell out to europe and the result will be high bill for british family but there be more the eu be expand carbon pricing to include transport and heating emission so alignment with the expand scheme would mean extra taxis on every british family for drive their car and heat their home will the minister rule out align at least with the expand scheme and say no to new taxis on everyday life yes or no be absolutely disappointed by the conservatives should expect more but maybe need to get use to be disappoint we see the press release week ago and it have have no publicity because it be conservative party scare story it be absolute nonsense the government be serious about bear down on the cost of energy for business and we be get on with the serious work of do that suggest that the conservatives get grip and join we in that task clean energy transition what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the clean energy transition on worker we firmly believe that the clean energy transition be the economic opportunity of the century in recent week we have secure thousand of new job in carbon capture offshore wind and british supply chain as we transform the way we power our country we be determined to ensure that community across our country benefit from good job and good wage that be what our clean energy mission be all about thank the minister for her response but could she go far in set out the government assessment of how in the clean energy transition new job can be create here in the uk in the manufacturing of component for offshore wind and other green energy project be delighted that last week the government be able to announce an initial million through great british energy to invest in supply chain for domestic offshore wind the fund will boost domestic job mobilise additional private investment and secure manufacturing facility for critical clean energy supply chain we be publish our industrial strategy in the spring which will set out our approach to the high growth drive sector include clean energy industry there be more good news last week for carbon capture usage and storage worker in england with million in supply chain contract for the liverpool bay hynet project which will even benefit north wales now that be on top of the billion that benefit teesside and merseyside have check and those place be not the centre of the uk energy industry for the last five year why have the government not allocate single penny to the acorn project in scotland where the clock be tick and where investor be very concerned that this government be not serious about it welcome the hon gentleman support for government policy and for our investment in ccus as he know acorn be matter for the spending review talk to many industry in scotland and everyone be supportive of the scheme we support the scheme and be work closely with industry but it be matter for the spending review household energy efficiency what step he be take to help improve the energy efficiency of home what step he be take to help improve the energy efficiency of home in alone we will upgrade up to home through the warm home plan and other measure that be more than double the number of home upgrade last year later this year we will set out more detail of our warm home plan to upgrade up to million home with energy efficient technology such as heat pump solar and insulation in order to deliver warm home and low bill recognise that there be very good scheme for those on low income and that heating home be really important for many old property and property in conservation area as fast as we heat the home the heat just go out the window in my area where there be lot of old home and home in conservation area it be near impossible to get permission to apply double or triple glazing can the secretary of state sort out this tension between have warm home and old home particularly when he be try so hard to ensure that home meet the grade rating for energy performance certificate by this need to be sort out with planning department the hon lady raise really important point be constantly on the look out for small measure and large in the planning system that can obstruct the sensible energy efficiency measure such as solar panel that will make all the difference say to she and other members of the house that if they have specific example of barrier or interpretation of guideline that be get in the way sometimes be not about the rule but about local council interpretation of they please bring they to our attention because we be constantly try to make it easy to make such upgrade happen earl social housing tenant from glastonbury be disabled and have face multiple barrier that have prevent he from self fund improvement to the sustainability and energy efficiency of his home in order to help he reduce his energy poverty and improve his health what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that social housing tenant receive energy upgrade in their home and in particular those live in old housing stock where upgrade might be more complex to achieve it sound as though the hon lady be raise an individual case and if she want to draw it to our attention she can do so on the more general point believe that her local authority have receive million as part of the warm home local grant so it would be worth talk to it about this again be sure that speak for the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh on this where there be specific issue about how particular scheme be work please do draw they to our attention and we will seek to act on they royal shrewsbury hospital in my constituency be delighted to receive investment for solar panel which will see our local trust save more than million by reduce its energy bill in the lifetime of the project will the secretary of state join in celebrate this excellent start to our nationalise great british energy company and update the house on the next step to get we towards that mission do join my hon friend in that say to all opposition members who vote against gb energy that many of they will now be get solar panel on school and hospital in their constituency let all their constituent know that those be local mp who oppose cut bill for school and hospital in their own constituency welcome the million of government funding for norwich labour lead city council to improve energy efficiency in home which will help tackle fuel poverty and provide much more comfort will the secretary of state welcome norwich labour leadership on this issue and set out how we will provide more funding to local council so that they can go far fast my hon friend raise really important point about the crucial role of local authority in relation to these issue one of the thing that my right hon friend the deputy prime minister have do be devolve more funding to combined authority on this we want to go far include in relation to local authority because it be local authority include my hon friend which congratulate who know good the particular need of their own locality and they be key part of the answer to the energy efficiency upgrade that we need great british energy what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on job creation in industrial community great british energy will support the creation of thousand of high quality well pay job right across the country and help rebuild the uk industrial heartland just last week the prime minister announce million for great british energy to kick start supply chain here in the uk once the great british energy bill finish its final stage in parliament we will come forward with more exciting plan for our domestic clean energy champion welcome the million of investment for gb energy announce last week think we all recognise the opportunity of the green energy transition but what opportunity be there for my harlow constituent to be part of that publicly own energy company my hon friend be absolutely right to point out that with great british energy and our clean power mission we be try to create the job that will deliver that transition here in the uk which be something that the conservatives fail on for many year we expect that funding and much more that will come from great british energy to mobilise more than billion in private investment in domestic supply chain drive forward manufacturing and industry here in the uk and the good job that go with it what assessment have the minister make of the number of job that great british energy will create in the people republic of china think the right hon gentleman give the game away there although the conservative party do not particularly care where the supply chain be we in the labour party be commit to deliver good well pay job in this country if he be so concerned about invest in british supply chain he might have bother to vote for great british energy in the first place call the shadow minister when gb energy be first propose we be tell it would employ people and create job fast forward to february this year and that number have be revise down to to with vague commitment to at some point in the next year as the general secretary of the gmb say yesterday they be go to open shiny new office on high street full of charity shop because they be close the city of aberdeen down gb energy be white elephant if the gmb can see it why can not the minister surely he agree that the way to deliver job growth and energy security and to protect community such as aberdeen be to lift the ban on licence replace the energy profit levy as soon as possible and declare the north sea open for business be not quite sure which one of the variety of part in that speech the hon gentleman would like to respond to as usual he steamroll through his question fast than he run the marathon congratulate he on that he happen to be the only person in aberdeenshire who be against investment in his community when labour member vote to deliver investment through great british energy not through job in the headquarters but through the investment it make in supply chain and innovation in his city he vote against it and he will have to answer to his constituent for that nuclear power sector what step he be take to support the nuclear power sector nuclear power be critical part of our clean power ambition we be make strong progress on sizewell and great british nuclear be drive forward its small modular reactor competition we have also see the nuclear regulatory taskforce set up by the prime minister and we be end the legacy of no new nuclear be complete in the long year when the conservatives be in power the transition to net zero be chance to create decent high skilled job for the future that include the next generation of small nuclear reactor which could revolutionise our energy market and deliver clean affordable energy the snp have veto nuclear energy project in scotland for almost year determine to leave scotland behind be scotland miss out on the economic opportunity that nuclear offer planning matter include the siting of new nuclear be devolve to the scottish parliament so it be rightly for it to decide however agree that scotland be miss out on the huge potential of new nuclear if the ideological block introduce by the snp be lift billion of pound could be invest in scotland with the countless skilled job that go with that that could well be deliver next year if scottish government be elect that take the industry and opportunity of scotland seriously and deliver those well pay skilled job that would come by elect scottish labour government datum from the last year show that ynys môn see drop of in job link to the nuclear industry the bad figure for uk constituency despite wylfa be recognise as the good site for new nuclear in europe we see no development from the last government will the secretary of state and the minister give we the recognition and acknowledgment that wylfa need new nuclear and that that will be see in the near future the hon lady have raise with that point and the wide question of energy job in her constituency number of time and thank she for that and for the way she have do so wylfa be an important site and continue to be one that the government be consider we will take forward those decision in due course as have say to she on number of previous occasion we be commit to deliver the job that go with that and wylfa remain an important site reduce industrial electricity prices what step his department be take to help reduce industrial electricity price industrial energy price double under the previous government and industry suffer as do consumer when wholesale price rocket at the start of the ukraine war the good way to secure bill for the long term for industry as well as for consumer be to deliver clean power by the truth be that the tories run down our energy infrastructure just as they run down our road and rail infrastructure and our public service we be rebuild that infrastructure make it more secure for the long term and less reliant on foreign dictator thus give we energy independence good job and cheap bill grow the economy will need cheap energy but ineos chief executive have warn that labour crippling carbon taxis and other levy threaten uk manufacturing and make we more reliant on import when will minister start listen and realise that their dogma drive energy policy be cost job and investment and when will they actually act to make our electricity price more competitive as uk steel say recently the main driver of the price disparity be the wholesale electricity cost which be drive by the uk reliance on natural gas the good way to secure bill for the long term be to deliver clean power by and that be what we be do green job be great job and welcome the billion of private investment in clean energy since the election of this labour government in order to bring down our industrial energy price far what step will the government take to get we on to clean energy that we control and off the fossil fuel that be in the control of dictator my hon friend be right to point out the huge amount of private sector investment that be come in with clean energy this be why in the industrial strategy clean energy be one of the growth drive sector where we have see growth in the economy we be also see hundred of thousand of job which the conservative now seem determined to oppose we will introduce the clean energy of the future and that be why we be push for clean energy by that will bring down bill give we energy security and create really good quality job national grid resilience what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the resilience of the national grid against the potential disruption of offshore energy infrastructure before answer the hon lady substantive question want to offer she my huge congratulation on smash to smithereen on sunday the previous record hold by female mp in the london marathon great britain have highly resilient energy network with diverse source of supply the national energy system operator can balance the system in wide range of scenario include potential disruption to offshore infrastructure the uk currently have about gw of offshore wind capacity which supply about of our energy in order to reach the government target this will have to increase by three time to to gw in just five year and to achieve that we will have to rely on chinese wind infrastructure and technology what specific risk assessment have the government carry out into the impact of this expose vulnerability and reliance on china for what will be significant amount of our energy supply will not comment on individual investment case but in every single case the government make an assessment and we look at the national security implication seriously just as the conservatives do when they be in government would just gently say that the reason the supply chain in this country be as weak as they be be that they be underfunde and under invest for year by the conservatives there could have be decision at the point when they take ambitious step to move towards clean power to build the supply chain here but they choose not to do so they choose to tow thing into our water instead we be reverse that but it can not happen overnight energy efficiency council leaseholders and social homes what step he be take to ensure that local authority have adequate resource for energy efficiency upgrade for council leaseholder and social home at the autumn budget billion be allocate to local authority and social housing provider support they to deliver warm and more energy efficient home across the country target low income household in particular this go alongside our plan to raise standard in rent property to ensure that no social or private renter have to live in cold draughty home be pleased to see the government commitment to provide thousand of low income household with energy efficient upgrade this could not have come too soon for my vulnerable constituent who be live on housing estate with outdated energy system that sometimes leave they without hot water and heating for month on end camden council which know the minister know well have plan to upgrade the energy efficiency of those estate but in many case it just do not have the resource to replace the heating system with heat pump which would lower bill and carbon emission even far what assurance can the minister give that local authority will be give the support necessary to deliver the energy upgrade to the high possible level my hon friend make an important point local authority will have critical role to play in our warm home plan under our warm home scheme we be offer substantial support to enable low income household to transition to clean heat for example our warm home social housing fund allow grant recipient to receive an additional clean heat upgrade and under our warm home local grant be be provide on top of the baseline to enable all household particularly low income household to benefit from clean heat know how on top of her brief the minister be so will she confirm that few than third of council home have an energy performance certificate rating in compare with over by last year less than of home in the uk have decent insulation in when labour last leave office and when the right hon member for doncaster north ed miliband who be chuntere from sedentary position be in power and more than do by the time we leave office will she commit to fast rate of improvement under this government than we ever see under the previous labour government welcome the right hon member commitment to our plan to upgrade home however he be try to rewrite history because when we look at the record of the previous government we see many failure but the most abject and egregious be the failure to insulate enough home to ensure that household be protect from price rise that be the conservatives legacy and it be one we be determined to turn around that be why we be committed to upgrade million of home across the country national wealth fund opportunity for industry what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the opportunity for industry through the national wealth fund the national wealth fund have critical role to play alongside great british energy in drive investment and job into clean energy industry the fund be already make great progress include participate in the late round by geopura uk base green hydrogen pioneer as well as support critical mineral in cornwall as part of our mission for clean power by our labour government be drive economic growth in luton and bedfordshire through our support for the sustainable expansion of luton airport and the exciting new universal studios do the minister agree that we need to match those positive development with incentivise investment in renewable energy to ensure that the pursuit of growth contribute to meet our climate commitment the government welcome the plan to invest in and around luton include the expansion of luton airport and the incredibly exciting universal theme park which be on the perfect site as its president say it also have perfect mp these project along with the mass clean power investment we be deliver will grow the economy and deliver direct benefit to the community that host this vital clean power infrastructure which will take all of we off the fossil fuel market rollercoaster the domestic user of electricity pay per kilowatt the domestic user of main gas pay people who live in urban britain buy their energy for quarter of the price pay by people in rural britain this be massive problem and wonder whether the minister could explain how the government will address it thank the hon gentleman for that question though it be not quite about the national wealth fund he be right to highlight electricity price this be challenge for industry and one we inherit from the previous government the good way to bring those bill down be to secure clean power by but he be right to highlight the challenge and that be what we be try to fix topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility last week government and more than global business gather in london for the first global summit on the future of energy security with the international energy agency hear from country after country the hard headed case for clean energy role in deliver energy security to free we from the global fossil fuel market control by petrostate and dictator also hear from many clean energy business that britain be the place where they want to invest because of the clarity and speed of this government mission home in rural area experience some of the high rate of fuel poverty in the uk rural property be less energy efficient than the national average and many be simply hard to insulate will the minister confirm that my constituent in penrith and solway will see the additional challenge of rurality reflect in the government ambitious warm home plan one hundred per cent my hon friend be absolutely right about that the minister for energy consumers and often discuss how we have to ensure that our warm home plan take account of the particular need and challenge face rural area call the shadow minister voter feel they be ask to make financial sacrifice when they know that their impact on global emission be minimal present policy solution be inadequate and therefore unworkable the current approach be work any strategy base on either phase out fossil fuel in the short term or limit consumption be strategy doom to fail do the secretary of state agree with his former boss tony blair the shadow minister talk about the tony blair institute report agree with lot of what it say it say that we should move ahead on carbon capture and storage which the government be do it say that we should move ahead on the role of artificial intelligence which the government be do it say that we should move ahead on nuclear which the government be do the shadow minister say only three week ago after his party drop its net zero policy this will surprise people mr speaker order no secretary of state this be topical question do not need full statement to be honest be look forward to hear what say few week ago mr speaker it be okay for the secretary of state to admit when he be wrong as tony blair say yesterday this strategy be doom to fail why can the secretary of state not see what the gmb and tony blair see

look at it in future as project develop and more detail come forward welcome the government view that nuclear power be essential to our clean power goal what step be the department take to ensure that new nuclear can be build wherever that be possible across the country include in my constituency my hon friend ask an important question new nuclear be absolutely part of the energy mix that be why we

that do right the clean energy transition will support community across the uk and thousand of new job what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that derby be at the heart of that opportunity my hon friend be right this clean energy transition be about create job be delighted to open the factory which be create job and be million investment manufacturing cylinder for heat pump this be an opportunity that this government be go to seize for britain this secretary of state think it be good idea to fill our field with solar panel at cost of billion of pound to the british taxpayer hate to break it to he but solar panel rely on sunshine so why be he now support project to block out the sunshine the hon gentleman never cease to amaze and not in good way reform have make its decision be not sure what the conservatives position be cheap clean home grow power be the answer for britain because it give we energy security and free we from the petrostate and dictator we be in favour of it reform be against it goodness know where the conservative party be electric vehicle sale growth be at risk of slow down many private car and fleet owner would transition to evs but patchy provision of public charging for those unable to charge at home and inadequate power capacity for rapid charging on our strategic road network for long distance driver be two key reason for reluctance to buy ev what discussion be desnz minister have with power network charge provider and the department for transport to address this order have lot of member need to get in these be topical question they be mean to be short and punchy my hon friend be right to point out that public charging point be critical that be why the regulator ofgem allocate billion over the next five year to maintain and upgrade the infrastructure have have number of meeting with network operator about this question and work closely with my colleague in the department for transport to ensure we be roll out more point my constituent continue to face high electricity bill among the high in the country at approximately per year one of my local hairdresser tell that their electricity have go up from to month will the government commit to bolder policy by ease restriction on solar and wind power and drive investment in renewable to help struggle business the hon lady be right clean home grow power be the answer so that be an unequivocal yes industrial community such as st austell and the clay country have be stifle in recent year by soar energy cost what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that industry such as the proud china clay industry be internationally competitive my hon friend be right there be long stand issue around industrial energy price the key be get off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel market because just as family finance be ruin in the cost of living crisis it be the same in relation to business finance and public finance it be an essential part of the answer in my constituency many elderly and disabled people face very high energy bill due to essential medical equipment and heating need what support be the government provide to ensure that these household be protect from the high cost of electricity we know that consumer be under pressure with energy bill that be why last winter billion of support be provide to help vulnerable customer through our warm home discount and through industry that be why we be extend the warm home discount from million household to million household and do ongoing work to ensure we be support the most vulnerable household

france and indeed to my french counterpart marc ferracci who be in london for our international energy summit be happy for the department to engage with she and tell she about the work we be do on that issue during the general election the secretary of state repeatedly promise my constituent that if they vote labour their energy price would be reduce by not by up to will the secretary of state repeat that promise at the dispatch box we say we would cut bill by up to and that be absolutely what we be determined to do they have go up the hon gentleman say that bill have go up but let give he little basic lesson they have go up because we be expose to fossil fuel price the only way to bring they down be by have source of clean home grow power that we control the pimlico district heating undertaking be build in the first ever district heating network in the uk it use to be cut edge but it be in desperate need of replacement so that my constituent can have heating and hot water will the government work with local authority such as labour westminster city council to make sure that all the cost of replacement do not necessarily fall just on resident westminster city council own the network and we know that it be consider option for refurbishing and potentially decarbonise it in the round we be commit to work with district network to do two thing to increase technical standard so that they be more efficient and critically to properly regulate they so that we protect consumer from unfair price when will the government decide whether to support the uk morocco power project know the right hon gentleman have an important interest in this project we continue to have discussion with xlink and obviously we be happy to brief he on those discussion unlike conservative members

stafford eccleshall and the village with that in mind will the minister and the secretary of state visit my constituency to see ge vernova and the hard work that it be do there yes be the answer look forward to it my hon friend be right this be about the job of the future conservative members might want to turn their back on they we will not as we need some oil and gas while on the road to clean energy economy do it not make sense to produce our own rather than import it from other country and thus increase the global carbon footprint consultation have just close on the future of north sea energy we have be very clear that our manifesto commitment be to not issue new licence for explore new field but we will manage exist field for the entirety of their lifespan mps across the humber region be unite in support for the vike carbon capture usage and storage project can the government give an update on any progress with track programme as with acorn we think viking be really important project be very proud of the progress we make on track and we be obviously look at both viking and acorn in the spending review will the secretary of state ensure that gb energy have focused plan to deliver and to help the farmer in my constituency to tap the latent energy in their beck and river so that we can support farming as well as the battle against climate change the hon gentleman make very important point about the role that local community energy can play think that be what he be allude to we be committed to ensure that great british energy local have already make some announcement in this space include on local energy funding in england we will have much more to say in due course but we want to ensure partnership so if the hon gentleman write to will make sure that what he say get to gb energy the scottish national party celebrate the closure and demolition of longannet coal power station in my constituency without have plan for its future the former first minister press the button on the charge herself what conversation do ministers plan to have with the site owner scottish power about the future of the site and what role might there be for the uk government in bring investment and job to my constituency my hon friend be right to make the point about longannet we have conversation with scottish power on number of issue include this he again emphasise the important role that nuclear could play in scotland in the future it could obviously be an important site for range of us but if the ideological ban on nuclear by the snp be lift we could look at other opportunity for such site when be at the scotland office be regularly lobby by retire senior executive from the electricity industry who want to state their concern about how long it would take to reboot the network in scotland if there be major outage obviously seek the necessary assurance from those run the network but in the light of what have happen in spain and portugal would be reassure if ministers seek those assurance again my under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for rutherglen michael shanks and regularly discuss this issue which relate to one of the first duty of government reassure the right hon gentleman that not only be this focus for government but we will look at what happen in spain and portugal to see if there be any lesson to be learn about our resilience as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on fusion energy know that fusion technology not only have the potential to create thousand of job but could also be the answer to our long term clean energy security need do the minister agree with that support fusion be good example of the government crowd in private sector investment create job and win investment for place like the east midland my hon friend be real champion for his constituency and for the benefit that the development of fusion will bring we continue to invest and to have discussion with international counterpart there be very bright future for fusion and for his constituent as result the minister will be aware of the switch on of moray west offshore wind farm at buckie in my constituency last week create job deliver clean energy and help our nation to achieve net zero do the minister accept that the current transmission charge regime pose significant and immediate threat to investment in offshore wind in scotland will he meet and industry representative to explore that matter far we be delighted to switch on the wind farm the secretary of state for scotland be there to push the button last week it be fantastic example of the potential of offshore wind of course be happy to meet the hon gentleman have already meet he and have very enjoyable conversation and be very happy to talk about the issue the review of the electricity market arrangement that we be go through will look at the issue of transmission charge it be an important conversation to have and be happy to speak to he on the subject the united kingdom be particularly susceptible to change in international gas price during the energy crisis and bill and price soar as result under this government gb energy be instal solar panel in hospital in my camborne redruth and hayle constituency but will the minister remind we which party preside over the bad cost of live crisis in memory order mr moon please you will not get call again if you carry on like that be sure the minister will know the answer be delighted to remind the house that it be the conservative party that leave we with energy insecurity and we be never go to leave this country vulnerable in the way that it do as my hon friend the member for ashfield lee anderson say the government seem to have three point plan point one be to cover farmland in solar panel and point two be to block out the sun what be point three what be the point of the hon gentleman party have be contact by several constituent who have experience fail scheme installation what support be there for constituent when installation go wrong be rogue installer get pay for work that be not complete properly what step be be take to address such failure we be aware of issue that we have have with and the great british insulation scheme if constituent have be affect they should have receive letter from ofgem they should be able to contact their installer who be oblige to fix the work and there be clear redress mechanism there be wide point we know that the system for quality assurance and consumer redress be not fit for purpose and we be determined to overhaul it in the global warmist want to put black dust on the arctic to block the sun now the minister want to put black dust on cloud to block the sun again be his plan not bonker million of taxpayer money have be spend which will only put up energy price even far this be like conspiracy theory go mad feel like we have enter whacky world let we keep our eye on the prize as country we be vulnerable because of our exposure to fossil fuel this government have one mission alone to get clean home grow power so that we take back control kashmir increase tension urgent question will the minister make statement on the killing of people in pahalgam in kashmir and the increase tension between india and pakistan the horrific terrorist attack in pahalgam in indian administer jammu and kashmir on april be devastating interruption order member must sit down because the minister be on his foot reply our thought be with those affect their love one and of course the people of india this attack leave people dead most of whom we understand be tourist travel to the region follow the attack india have announce number of diplomatic measure against pakistan and pakistan have reciprocate the official uk travel advice for indian administer kashmir continue to advise against all travel to jammu and kashmir except for travel by air to the city of jammu travel within the city and travel within the union territory of ladakh this be very sensitive situation with real risk to regional and wide stability understandably there have be huge interest within uk community kashmir have be flashpoint for conflict between india and pakistan many time over previous decade the prime minister speak to prime minister modi on april to express his condolence on behalf of the british people the uk condemn all form of terrorism and the extremism that sustain it wherever it occur the foreign secretary speak to india external affairs minister jaishankar on april to pass on the uk condolence and to express the uk government support to the indian people at this difficult time the foreign secretary have also speak over the weekend to pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister ishaq dar heighten tension between india and pakistan inevitably raise concern about escalation effective channel of engagement to safeguard stability in the region be essential the uk support the un security council press statement on april which condemn the attack and reaffirm that act of terrorism be criminal and unjustifiable the long stand position of the uk be that it be for india and pakistan to find last resolution to the situation in kashmir take into account the wish of the kashmiri people it be not for the uk to prescribe solution we will continue to monitor the situation closely through our high commissioner in new delhi and islamabad thank you mr speaker for allow this question and thank the minister for his statement have three further point first this be terrorist attack of the utmost barbarity and it deserve to be condemn by all my thought be with the family of those kill the killing take place in popular tourist location and most victim be tourist among the victim be man marry only the week before who be honeymoon with his wife the manner of the selection of the victim be particularly horrific with the killer actively seek out non muslims before kill they in cold blood the minister will be aware that the kashmir region have be the scene of previous terrorist attack that have claim many innocent life include in chittisinghpura where sikhs be kill in what support can the uk provide to ensure that the terrorist be find and bring to justice and to ensure that their network of support be dismantle secondly there have be significant escalation of tension between india and pakistan include the measure that the minister have outline india and pakistan have engage in large scale military hostility in the past in the region and there be real risk that the nation could revert to military conflict again what can the uk do to encourage de escalation of tension while ensure the eradication of the terrorist organisation and their support network wherever they exist finally the minister will be aware that there have be protest in the uk outside india and pakistan high commission those protest have be characterise by provocative language and gesture include what appear to be throat slit motion by an allege pakistan official windows have be smash at pakistan high commission in london and an individual have be arrest and charge do the minister recognise the importance of proactive work with community across the uk to ensure that we do not see downturn in community relation here thank my hon friend for his engagement on these question be sure that the whole house share his horror at the detail of this incident the targeting of the victim and the way in which it be carry out first will address the scene on uk street we be aware of report of the video that my hon friend refer to the metropolitan police be investigate so will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident but it be obviously concern we take seriously our responsibility for the security of all embassy and high commission under the vienna convention so both the pakistani and indian high commission will receive all the support of the uk state to ensure that they stay safe as my hon friend have say and as know many in this house feel these issue have long be discuss with passion on british street we call on all side all community leader and all involve to call for calm at time of tension in the region call the shadow foreign secretary thank the hon member for smethwick gurinder singh josan for secure the question and my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman who also request question on this topic today for the support he have give to india my condolence thought and prayer be with all those affect by the murderous violent terrorism that have take place in pahalgam recognise that for india and the diaspora community those in the uk in particular this have be really difficult week this be an act of terrorism and we should call it out for exactly what it be it be part of long stand pattern of attack on civilian visitor to the region and minority community and the uk must always stand with our friend during time of this nature we have series of long stand security and counter terrorism partnership with india go back to the new delhi declaration in and include the india uk strategic partnership in the comprehensive strategic partnership announce in and the uk india road map agree under the last government under those partnership security issue have be absolutely watertight which be why we must always be in lockstep with our friend in india can the minister tell we what information the uk government have on those responsible for carry out these terrorist attack do the government believe that lashkar taiba the terrorist group proscribe in the uk bear responsibility be the government aware of any cross border link to pakistan among the perpetrator of this terrorist act give that attack seem to take place at the same time as high profile us politician visit india this be not the first time do the government have view on whether this be coincidence or whether it demonstrate pattern of target and deliberately time attack we know that the prime minister speak to prime minister narendra modi last week but have the uk provide any specific support in response to this terror attack or take any practical step to assist our friend in india have the government undertake an assessment of the security implication of this attack for the uk if lashkar taiba or front link to they be responsible it should be note that disturbing report be emerge that this terrorist group may have have engagement with hamas have the government make an assessment of the relationship between group cause terror and destabilisation in kashmir and those pursue violence and terrorism that threaten our interest and global peace and security finally can the minister give an update on the action be take to prevent tension from escalate among community in the uk include protection for the high commission which have already be mention and will the uk leverage its influence to ease tension between india and pakistan thank the right hon lady for her question india be friend to the uk and we have be clear about the depth of our friendship in our response to this incident she would not expect to comment in detail on intelligence and security matter in relation to this attack but assure she that we be look at it very closely she be right that wherever terrorism be find it be threat to global peace and security include in the uk will not comment far from this dispatch box on link between some of the group that the right hon lady have mention but assure she that our security agency take these matter very seriously as she would expect the right hon lady ask important question about the indian high commission as say in my early answer we will offer our full support there be enhance protection outside the high commission and it will be top priority for the government to ensure that no harm come to any indian diplomat or indeed any other diplomat here in the uk we be play our role to try to ensure that tension do not escalate many of we in this house be familiar with the tense and storied history between the two country we be friend to they both and we do not want to see an uncontrolled escalation in tension may pay my respect to those who have lose love one in the horrific terrorist attack in indian administer jammu and kashmir my thought be with they at this devastating time many of my constituent have write to about the escalation of hostility here in the uk can the minister say what conversation he be have with indian and pakistani counterpart to address this situation this escalation be unsettling for community within the uk british pakistanis and british indians be value part of our community but we look to all community and faith leader to spread the message that now be the time for come together across religious and ethnic difference not to play out the tension between two state on the street of the uk and we will continue to send that message call the liberal democrat spokesperson associate myself with the comment that have already make reflect on the grief of the community tear apart last week tuesday horrific murder be utterly devastating and those responsible must face the full weight of the law the escalation of tension between india and pakistan be alarming as be report of incident of fire be exchange by soldier at the border and it threaten to destabilise the entire region it be vital that leader in both country commit to an open dialogue and wide effort to de escalate we hope that that include india commit to reinstate the indus water treaty the suspension of which threaten water access for pakistanis and pakistan reopen its airspace to indian own airline the uk must engage with both government and encourage return to dialogue and retreat from retaliatory action to ensure that decision take in the wake of tuesday horrific attack do not endanger more life can the minister confirm what conversation he have have with official in new delhi on reinstate the indus water treaty and with official in islamabad on reopen its airspace it be vital that effective channel of engagement to safeguard stability in the region exist and we be encourage both party to that effect there have be lot of speculation about the diplomatic measure that have be announce so far as we understand it international agreement have be put in abeyance rather than be rescind in the long term the proper functioning of water management in the indus water catchment area be vital for both side of the line the whole house be unite in its condemnation of the horrific attack that kill people in pahalgam kashmir it have rightly be condemn by all in the region and we must now see full and independent investigation where those responsible be bring to justice the response from the indian government have be somewhat concern with unilateral action take to revoke the indus water treaty risk the life and livelihood of million in pakistan we be now hear report of crackdown in kashmir with people round up by the police and bulldozer tactic use on household hard line group have issue statement promise reprisal attack death threat and action against every muslim in india kashmir continue to be flashpoint between the two nuclear neighbour so do the minister agree that the international community must now seriously focus on de escalation and long term peace in the region can he also set out what the government be do to ensure that kashmiris do not face further persecution or oppression this be clearly time of heighten tension which inevitably invite concern both in the region and here in the uk we be as say engage with both state to try to find the most effective way to prevent these terrible incident from ever be repeat but also to ensure continue stability in the region ask at business question last week for statement on this issue this week so be grateful to you mr speaker for make sure that we have that statement through this urgent question the reality of this terrorist attack which be well organised and well co ordinate be that despite the minister word these man who be murder systematically by be shoot in the head be either hindu or christian this be deliberate islamist attack on those tourist who be just go about their business in peaceful manner these terrorist be well equipped and they be well co ordinated the sad reality be that while the government may offer expression of condolence and support to the people of india the terrorist basis that exist along the line of control in the part of kashmir illegally occupy by pakistan continue to operate across that line of control will the government commit to full support for india in apprehend the terrorist responsible and bring the backer of those terrorist to justice will the government take all step to support the erosion and elimination of terrorism in jammu and kashmir the hon gentleman have come to have an argument but be not sure which part of the statement he do not like until the investigation be conclude we should not speculate on the nature of the attack say to he that will do everything we can to ensure that those who commit this horrific attack be bring to justice and india will have our support in that share in the comment make in this house we be horrify by this terrorist attack and my thought be with the family the victim and those in india we have see worrying scene play out in london as my hon friend the member for smethwick gurinder singh josan mention we can not let the situation escalate on to uk shore we all bear responsibility to help de escalate tension what step be the uk take to support international body especially the united nations in their call for de escalation in tension as have say we have speak at the senior level to both state and we have make clear the importance of maintain stability in the region at this time echo the word of condemnation over the horrific terror attack in pahalgam which take the life of innocent tourist express my heartfelt condolence to all those who have be affect the rapid escalation of event follow this tragedy have be deeply worrying india unfounded claim against pakistan be dangerous and irresponsible reaction to the tragedy suffer in kashmir the unilateral and illegal decision to suspend the indus water treaty threaten to cut the lifeline of million people in pakistan and it can not stand will the minister join in express concern over the knife edge position that these two nation be in and call for adherence to the guidance set under international body of law will he make plea to calm the situation if it be exacerbate it will have severe consequence that spread much far than that region alone think have set out our view on the importance of stability in the region already this afternoon agree with the hon member that it be critical for all actor and international partner to ensure the long term sustainability of the indus river system welcome the statement from the minister today in light of the awful terror attack in indian administer kashmir what work be the government undertaking to consult the kashmiri diaspora here in the uk and identify their concern both the foreign office and other uk government departments engage regularly with the british kashmiri community who be an important part of so many community across the united kingdom and will continue to do so be sure the government recognise that the strategic aim of this sort of terrorist atrocity be to provoke indiscriminate retaliation and undermine peaceful relation between neighbouring country between which there may be some history of hostility will the minister impress on the indian government the necessity of focus on the actual perpetrator and not on the wide community and will he impress on the pakistani government the importance in good faith of track down those responsible too often in the region for which be responsible and indeed in this country we have see terrorist attack design to have exactly the effect that the right hon gentleman have describe namely to provoke tension intercommunal hostility and breakdown of law and order as he say proper law enforcement lead response base on focus on the actual perpetrator be important in this area as it be throughout the world may first send my condolence thought and prayer to all the victim of this heinous terrorist attack in occupy kashmir there be large kashmiri diaspora in my constituency and many of my constituent have reach out to express deep concern number of they have mention the indus water treaty pakistan have already be suffer from the effect of flood in past year from which it have not recover at time of escalation and trouble such as this it seem to be community at large be they in india or pakistan who suffer what message can the minister give my constituent to reassure they that the uk be do all it can to de escalate bring thing back to normal and hold the perpetrator to account we be focus on hold the perpetrator to account be familiar with the issue face pakistan in relation to acute natural disaster be there during the disastrous flood in and recognise the importance of the indus river system in both india and pakistan and of co operation between the two state to manage that vital system there be great deal of speculation about what have be decide and what have be agree but we understand that diplomatic treaty be be hold in abeyance and that there be still space for long term answer to some of these question as an officer of the all party parliamentary group on british hindus and with constituency that contain considerable indian and pakistani community be especially shock and sadden by the news of the horrific murder of people last tuesday and have receive many email from constituent raise their own concern of particular concern be report of the targeting of hindus and christians such race base terror be unacceptable anywhere in the world what step be the government take to encourage both india and pakistan to investigate these terrible crime and to ensure that line of communication be keep open to avoid further escalation of the conflict we be encourage direct line of communication and we be of course encourage pakistan to provide all possible assistance with the investigation of these horrific crime may associate myself with the comment of the minister and other member who have condemn the killing of innocent people give that tension between india and pakistan be run high and result in arrest do the minister agree with and with other who have raise the point that we must not let this issue boil over into our street if anything we should be work to convey message of peace and hope to that part of the world in the light of the tit for tat action be undertake by pakistan and india do the minister also agree that we need to encourage the holding of an open independent inquiry to establish the fact ensure accountability and help to restore calm that would be far well for the world than india and pakistan nuclear power go to war my hon friend be of course right peace and calm be vital for community here and across the world the two state be talk to each other which be welcome india concern for its own security be understandable in the light of such horrific incident it be clearly take step to try to establish the fact as good it can and it will have british support to do so at time of such tragedy language be incredibly important all of we in all part of the house condemn this terrorist incident but number of my constituent have be particularly concerned about the bbc describe it as militance rather than as what it be terrorist attack will the minister use his position to make representation to the bbc to ensure that it understand the importance of the language it use resist call for ministers to police the bbc language too much but let be clear this be horrific terrorist attack and that be the view of the british government we have see the kargil incursion the chittisinghpura attack the hijacking of air india flight the attack on gandhinagar the attack on the lok sabah itself the attack on the taj hotel in mumbai and the suicide bomb attack at pulwama that kill people and now tourist have be murder at pahalgam that be just short list of the activity of pakistan base terror organisation such as jaish mohammad lashkar taiba and its derivative include the resistance front that have take place since you and be first elect to the house mr speaker they destabilise international security between two nuclear state and cause unwarranted tension in community relation here be it not time to make the support that we give to pakistan conditional on its finally deal with and close down the terrorist training camp that it harbour we expect all our friend to work closely on the share international scourge of terrorism pakistan itself have face series of deeply damaging terrorist attack in recent month and year and we press pakistan as we press all our ally in the region to take the step that be necessary to investigate not only the terrorist threat that face it but those that face its neighbour share the sentiment that have rightly be express by all other member it be crucial to condemn unequivocally all form of violence irrespective of their source and our thought and prayer be with the victim and their family the recent incident be stark reminder of the fragile peace that hang by thread in region that have suffer for too long from recur cycle of violence the intricate history of kashmir require diplomatic approach underpin by international co operation do the minister agree that the role of the uk as permanent member of the united nations security council must be to encourage and support effort that prioritise dialogue and reconciliation between india and pakistan do he also agree that the law abide people of kashmir deserve to live in peace and security without the shadow of perpetual conflict and that will be achieve only if they have the right of self determination of course the people of kashmir both indian administer and pakistani administer have the right to live in safety and we want to see that right exercise and of course there must be dialogue between india and pakistan at this time of heighten tension let add however that in the face of such horrific attack india also have the right to investigate to find the perpetrator and to bring they to justice for these terrible crime number of my constituent have express deep concern about the development in kashmir and we all condemn the attack and grow tension in the strong possible term do the minister agree that advocate for peaceful resolution in kashmir be also part of maintain community cohesion in the uk give that so many of we have constituent with family member and friend in the region do of course the uk support peaceful resolution of the long stand issue in kashmir between india and pakistan it be matter for the two country and we will support they in those endeavour join members across the house in condemn this act of terrorism the hon gentleman will know that his party manifesto pledge to pursue new strategic partnership with india welcome that but could he explain to the house what step be be make in regard to that pledge it will be by concert diplomatic effort but it will also be by leadership from the dispatch box around re characterise our commitment to india that people will gain strength from this government response be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give the opportunity to cast away any doubt there might be we stand with india in the face of this horrific attack we have at the very high level be in direct contact with the indian government this be an absolutely atrocious incident and they have our support in try to bring the perpetrator to justice if he will forgive will leave it to the minister responsible for india to provide an update in the house in slow time on the state of our relationship it continue to grow from strength to strength in light of the recent tragic attack on civilian in kashmir which we all condemn what step be the government take to de escalate

side of kashmir have listen carefully to the minister answer on the government position that this be now an issue for india and kashmir to resolve alone and welcome the action the government be take to reduce tension however in the long term peaceful settlement for this community will need help and need international facilitation per un resolution and self determination for the people of kashmir

hundred of family in my constituency who have be horrify by these event it be clear that the awful terror attack in kashmir have send shockwave through the british indian community and the global hindu community more broadly my constituent have speak overwhelmingly of justice and understandably so we all want to see peace and de escalation but understand that people will be hold to account for these horrific crime be vital to get there would just like to press the minister little more to be clear that the uk government when they stand with india be do all they can to identify the party responsible for these event and those who support and fund they so that they can be hold to account and justice can be find of course we want to see the perpetrator hold to justice properly and we will be support india to do so on point of order mr speaker early ask the minister to tell member of the house who be play the politic of communalism to stop play with fire he not only fail to do so but attack for observe the undoubted tension and sometimes even violence that take place here as foreign conflict be play out in this country can you advise on whether the minister can withdraw this attack if he simply misheard my question can he be allow to answer it now this be very serious issue minister would you like to respond far to that point of order mr speaker as understand the question the hon gentleman be suggest that there have be too much immigration from presumably both india and pakistan over the last period and that that be lead to communalism within constituency across the country this government interruption order the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy be not go to carry on speak from sedentary position have be absolutely clear from this dispatch box that do not want to see any communal tension in the uk have repeatedly call for calm if the hon gentleman be say that he believe that too much immigration have lead to order obviously we be not go to get anywhere like this sit down minister be not responsible for the answer that the minister make be sure that this matter will not rest there but it will have to rest for now because we be move on to the next urgent question irish republican alleged incitement urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the home department if she will make statement on the alleged incitement to murder member of parliament by the irish republican group kneecap thank the right hon gentleman for his urgent question let we never forget that we lose two member of this house jo cox and sir david amess in tragic circumstance both jo and sir david be passionate advocate for their constituent and they care deeply about range of issue and embody the fine democratic quality tradition and value of this house know that the thought of the whole house will be with their family today and every day want to reiterate the home secretary word and fully condemn the comment that have be make such remark be dangerous and irresponsible and this government utterly reject the view express by this group let be crystal clear political intimidation and abuse have no place in our society know that the house will want immediate answer on this issue but as the minister of state for policing and crime prevention say yesterday in relation to the urgent question on the headingley case the desire for immediate answer be often constrain by the obligation that we have as ministers and as member of this house not to do or say anything that would interfere in what be live police investigation as member know the investigation and prosecution of criminal offence be matter for the police and the crown prosecution service to determine and they be operationally independent of the government it be important that the police be allow to carry out their ongoing investigation free from political interference however for the benefit of the house let recap what the metropolitan police have themselves say about these report they say we have be make aware of the video and it have be refer to the counter terrorism internet referral unit for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be require although will not comment far on this specific case the safety and security of member of this house and all those who serve in elect office be an issue to which attach the utmost seriousness as do the home secretary and as do you mr speaker elect representative at all level and across all party must be able to perform their duty safely and without fear and through the defend democracy taskforce we be drive whole of government effort to ensure that that be the case the taskforce have recently agree programme of work to tackle the harassment and intimidation of elect member the taskforce be also support the speaker conference that be address these issue those of we who attend this place be all too aware of the devastating consequence of violence against our colleague and friend we may not always agree but if there be one universal truth to which we would all subscribe it be surely that our politic be well when it be conduct respectfully and safely hope and trust that that will have the support of members right across the house the home secretary and condemn the comment that have be make and we will work tirelessly to ensure the safety and security of all those who step forward to serve in public office two mp jo cox and sir david amess have be murder within the past decade in the line of duty while meet their constituent frankly that could have be any of we should like to ask the home secretary albeit in absentia four specific question first how long be this counter terrorist police inquiry likely to take the video plainly speak for itself how could the word kill your local mp possibly have be take out of context secondly we now know that kneecap apply for government grant during the previous parliament which be veto quite rightly by my right hon friend the member for north west essex mrs badenoch kneecap then appeal against this decision as discriminatory the incoming labour government conclude that fight the appeal would be not in the public interest can the home secretary tell the house which government minister approve that absurd decision to effectively surrender to kneecap over this and why thirdly kneecap be still book to appear at glastonbury the organiser of which incidentally receive some million of taxpayer subsidy during the covid pandemic do the home secretary agree that it would be unconscionable for kneecap to appear at least while the police inquiry be under way kneecap should surely be bar today to be crystal clear do the government agree with that yes or no finally kneecap have now offer crocodile tear apology to katie amess have that family not be through enough already so as it be within her gift will the home secretary now seriously reconsider their request to examine potential failure by prevent that may have contribute to david death via the auspex of the southport inquiry be that not the least we can do thank you mr speaker be genuinely grateful to the right hon gentleman for bring forward this matter because it provide we with an opportunity to discuss these issue which be something have be keen to do for some time let gently say to he that he mention the name of the band on number of occasion deliberately do not do so and will not do so it be for right hon and hon member to choose what language they use but my advice be not to give the band or its member any further publicity by name they will not be do so and suggest that other member do not either the right hon member speak about the home secretary let tell he what she say about this she say that this be total disgrace she say it dangerous and irresponsible to say these sort of thing and hope that everybody involve not just the band but also those involve surround they and those involve in event also take some responsibility on this and look very seriously at the consequence of these kind of remark not just what be say let also say to the right hon gentleman that chair the defend democracy taskforce clearly the home secretary have overall responsibility but the judgment be that would be here as the person who chair the taskforce but we both of course take the matter incredibly seriously he ask about the length of the investigation as know he will understand that be matter not for ministers but for the metropolitan police he also ask about the funding of the group let say again gently and respectfully that do not agree with the right hon gentleman characterisation of the case relate to the group funding do not raise this point proactively refer to it now only in response to his specific question the truth of the matter be that we inherit this situation from the previous government we inherit the scheme and we inherit this situation after approve the grant the previous government then turn on it be give they do not take proper legal advice and end up in costly legal battle that they lose this government have duty to bring that situation to an end and protect taxpayer money we be deeply concerned about all the thing that make up this case as the secretary of state for culture media and sport say yesterday that be precisely why we be rightly take the opportunity to review the scheme now the right hon gentleman ask about glastonbury it be for the organiser of the festival to decide who appear cop out if the right hon gentleman can be patient he will hear the entirety of my response it be not for government ministers to say who be go to appear at glastonbury it be for the organiser of the festival as have say there be live police investigation ongoing so the government urge the organiser of glastonbury to think very carefully about who be invite to perform there later this year for reason that completely understand and appreciate the right hon gentleman mention the amess family our thought and prayer continue to be with the amess family as they be with the family of jo cox the house will be aware because have speak about it previously that we have publish the prevent learning review to ensure that there be public scrutiny and transparency over the perpetrator dealing with prevent we will also publish the finding from lord anderson review the home secretary and want to ensure that every avenue have be explore that be why we will appoint senior figure to scrutinise all of the previous review that have take place to see whether any question still need to be answer or any issue still need to be address we will act as necessary if any such gap be identify as result of that process thank the minister for his answer to the urgent question nobody but those in my constituency and that of my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater know what it be actually like when somebody kill your mp the reverberation be still be feel in southend west and leigh three and half year later by the constituent never mind the family of sir david amess who will never recover from the loss do my hon friend agree that those in the public eye anyone in fact but especially those in the public eye should be careful with their word because word have power and can be incredibly dangerous we should condemn with all force the type of incitement we have see from this particular group be grateful to my hon friend for the remark he have make and not just today but previously totally agree he be absolutely right that word have consequence all of we both in and outside this house should treat other with respect and dignity join my hon friend in condemn the word that have be use and give he and the house my categorical assurance that we will do everything we possibly can to ensure the safety and security of all who serve in elect office call the shadow home secretary our thought today be with our dear friend sir david amess and jo cox they be brutally murder on surgery friday do their job on behalf of their constituent tragically they be not the first mps to be murder the crest of airey neave be up there above the door with those of sir david and jo behind those who incite the murder of mp be attack democracy itself will the minister join in condemn unreservedly the despicable evil that kneecap represent in the appalling comment they make would like to ask about the funding in november the department for business and trade decide to end its support for the legal challenge decision that result in the band win and become entitle to the money why do the government make that decision in the light of what we now know will they appeal against that decision critically will the minister give categoric assurance from the dispatch box that this band will never under any circumstance receive public money again from any source include the national lottery and northern ireland screen this organisation have also express support for hamas and hezbollah which be proscribe terrorist group the minister say that he do not want to comment on the police investigation however the government comment quite extensively on the investigation after southport so would like he to make clear as the government do last summer that they consider it in the public interest that the police investigate and if there be evidence prosecute these offence or potential offence if he be not willing to do that now he risk the perception of two tier justice finally have meeting very recently with sir david widow julia and his daughter katie who bear an enormous burden of grief they want to make sure that the lesson be learn from sir david murder as the minister know the perpetrator have be in the prevent programme previously like the perpetrator in reading and southport julia and katie amess would like sir david murderer and the failing of prevent to be look at alongside the southport case which be be investigate and the reading case will the minister honour his memory by agree to that today be grateful to the shadow home secretary for his remark he be right that when threat be make to member of this house or anyone who serve in elect office it be an attack not just on that individual but on our democracy that be precisely why this government have place as the last government do so much emphasis and importance on the work of the defend democracy taskforce the right hon member will know from his time in government that the taskforce be the fulcrum on which all the different bit of government join together ensure that our response to the threat we face be properly organise and that the resource be marshal correctly and appropriately it be how we enable all those who wish to serve in public life to do so without fear of the completely unacceptable attack we have see in recent year agree with he on that and hope it be matter on which we can all agree also agree with his point about the remark themselves will not name the band but reiterate that the government unreservedly condemn the remark that have be make the shadow home secretary ask specifically about funding in my early response give detail about the sequencing of the funding that be agree under the previous government he ask about future funding so let be clear with the house we do not think that individual express the view we have hear should be receive taxpayer funding that be non controversial thing to say as the secretary of state for culture media and sport say yesterday official be review the music export growth scheme in the light of the comment that have emerge would add the right hon member will probably agree that it seem strange to and be sure to other members of the house that republican group who be seemingly opposed to the british government would want to receive funding from they find that baffle the right hon member mention proscription and hamas and hezbollah he know well that those be proscribe organisation it be criminal offence to belong to invite support for recklessly express support for or arrange meeting in support of proscribe organisation it be also an offence to wear clothing carry article in public or publish an image of clothing or any article in way that arouse reasonable suspicion that an individual be member or supporter of proscribe organisation the government be crystal clear support for proscribe organisation be wholly unacceptable and where an offence have be commit the government trust that the police will use the full extent of the offence available to they the right hon member final point be about lady amess and katie amess hope that the right hon gentleman will take comfort from the response give to the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois about the seriousness with which we address these issue be acutely conscious that we have with we in the chamber member of jo cox family and it be right that we conduct ourselves in way as we be that remember the loss that the family have suffer and that this house have suffer the government will do everything we possibly can to ensure that those family be support and those terrible event never occur again it be disappointing to see how conservative member have approach this question would have hop that this be an issue on which the whole house could remain united the way in which it have be approach be to be regret have no desire to pour cold water on the daft political posturing of adolescent give voice in pop music that have be go on for decade and be somewhat of rite of passage but the comment of this band go far beyond what be remotely acceptable in civilised country will the minister therefore please use his good office to look to minimise the number of mainstream platform not just glastonbury across the board on which this band appear be grateful to my hon friend for his question he be absolutely right about the comment that have be make we unreservedly condemn they he make point that want to raise about the importance of the way in which we work co operatively and collaboratively across the house chair the defend democracy taskforce on behalf of the government but also chair it on behalf of all member of this house and the other house and on behalf of those who serve in local government my approach have always be and will always be to work co operatively with every political party be happy at any point to meet any member or any political party to discuss these matter my door be always open on the point my hon friend make about the profile of the band he will have hear my word with regard to glastonbury that be specifically why be not name they do not want to give they any further publicity but agree with the sentiment of his point call the liberal democrat spokesperson the remark by member of the band be completely unacceptable and it be right that they have apologise to the family of sir david amess and jo cox but clearly those comment should never have be make in the first place incitement to violence against member of parliament cut to the very heart of our democracy the reality be that two mp have be murder in the last decade it be absolutely right that the authority be look into other comment relate to encourage support for proscribe terror organisation want to look at what more the government can do what criterion do the home office apply when assess whether artist or performer be promote harmful or extremist rhetoric particularly where there be clear attempt to provoke public outrage what assessment have the minister make of the impact that comment like these may have on community cohesion be grateful to the hon member as always be for the sensible and reasonable way in which she frame her remark she be absolutely right incitement to violence be utterly unacceptable in any context and it be completely unacceptable in the context of member of this house and other elect politician that be why the prime minister recently refresh the mandate of the defend democracy taskforce and that be why as chair of that taskforce be work closely with law enforcement all government departments the electoral commission and range of different organisation include the police to ensure that right around the country we have the most coherent join up and properly resource response back at the general election last year be sure all of we see thing that we consider completely unacceptable it be my ambition as the chair and that of the government to ensure that electoral event be conscious that we be work through one at the moment be fight in way that enable and encourage reasonable and robust debate it be absolutely right that in the cut and thrust of politic there should be the rough and tumble of debate but think instinctively we all know where the line be draw and this incident go mile over where the line should be draw we will continue to look carefully at the circumstance of this case as say it be ultimately for the police to make an operational decision about where they want to go with it but give the hon member an assurance that through the ddtf we take these matter incredibly seriously would be happy to work even more closely with she her colleague and all member of the house in that endeavour may take moment to thank the speaker office for the support it give new mp to ensure that we all feel safe thank the minister for his response to the urgent question and equally for his commitment to ensure that members of the house feel safe and secure in their work do he agree that when we think about the security of mps we must also consider the safety of mps staff think about the staff who work in my constituency and do their job solely because they want to help people in my constituency they should never feel intimidated or unsafe be grateful to my hon friend who make some really important point join he in thank mr speaker the deputy speakers and all the speaker office for the work they do with the parliamentary security department in ensure that all member of the house be safe and secure the speaker conference into these matter be an important process that the government be support couple of week ago give evidence to mr speaker along with the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government my hon friend the member for bethnal green and stepney rushanara ali who be responsible for election we consider the process to be hugely valuable and we look forward to mr speaker conclusion we will want to work closely with he on implement the finding my hon friend be absolutely right to reference mps staff all of we will know that often where the rubber hit the road in our constituency be the extraordinary dedicated work be do on our behalf by our office manager our parliamentary assistant and our parliamentary caseworker they be absolutely in my thought when think about these matter the bridger network around the country be there for they as well as for member of the house it be worth add that in addition to member and their staff we need to ensure that our family member be properly protect have be in recent touch with the police specifically about incident that have occur on couple of occasion at member home address that be totally unacceptable have write to the police constructively to remind they of the power they have in that regard know that the minister will agree that part of the service that my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois have do the house today be that he have give we all the opportunity to make point that really should not need make namely that incitement to violence against members of parliament be no more acceptable than incitement to violence against any other member of our society the minister be entirely right to be cautious about prejudice an investigation into whether the criminal law have be break but do he agree that what we can and should say today be that artistic licence be not defence to breach of the criminal law agree with the right hon gentleman on both count the concern be not just the glorification of violence against mps and the impact that have on the family of mp who have be murder in terrorist incident include jo cox and sir david amess the same band have express support for hamas and hezbollah which be proscribe group and that have an impact on the feeling of safety and security in the jewish community the rhetoric that the band use represent return to an ugly rhetoric about communal difference in northern ireland return that know will cause fear and pain to hon member from northern ireland who lose friend and colleague due to terrorism my main concern however be about the impact on democracy as whole call for violence against politician of any party have chilling effect on the willingness of any normal citizen to think could run for council or could run to be an mp they think that they will put themselves and their family at threat of violence do the minister agree that it be vital for the future of democracy in this country that people feel that they can engage in public life without put their life and safety in danger my hon friend make two really important point completely agree with his remark at the beginning of his question he be also absolutely right to raise concern about the chilling effect that there could well be on our democracy be sure that all of we in this place know exceptional people who for reason that we all understand have decide not to step forward to serve in public life this house local council and police and crime commissioner be not get people who could otherwise make significant contribution to public life it be tragedy for our country that some people might feel that they should not step forward because of the risk pressure harassment and intimidation that go with service in public life that be precisely why we take the defend democracy taskforce so seriously and be work with colleague across government in local government and in the devolved administration to ensure that people do not feel that politics be too dangerous for they it would be terrible for our country if we get to that point be absolutely determined as be the home secretary to make sure that the defend democracy taskforce be as successful as possible in ensure that nobody feel that they do not want to step forward because of the risk may thank the hon member for north durham luke akehurst for make that reference although it be natural that we refer to jo cox and sir david amess it be important for member of this house to recognise that there be also four plaque in this chamber for ian gow airey neave robert bradford and sir anthony berry all of whom be murder by the irish republican antecedent to kneecap over the last hour we have see crocodile tear and hear confected apology and whataboutery but nothing can be say that will mask the naked hatred within those individual whose balaclavas have slip have hear the minister speak about his defend democracy taskforce and his aspiration for coherency across this united kingdom on the glorification of terrorism for far too long blind eye have be turn to the glorification of terrorism in northern ireland when confine to northern ireland it apparently seem to be quite acceptable yet it keep the wound of our past open and frustrate reconciliation to my mind there be no coherency on the application of law to prevent the glorification of terrorism in northern ireland will the minister meet my colleague and to ensure that there be be grateful to the right hon gentleman for that and he be absolutely right to refer to all the plaque in this chamber we think about all those who have lose their life serve our country the right hon gentleman may be aware that be in northern ireland recently where meet the justice minister to discuss this and other matter he may also be aware that in the autumn of last year write to the leader of all the northern ireland political party offer meeting indicate dissent he say that he do not receive the letter let say therefore that would of course be very happy to meet he and be keen to do that as quickly as possible yesterday write to glastonbury festival urge it to remove this music group from its line up because they have allegedly call for the murder of conservative colleague in this house and because we have see footage of they appear to show support for hezbollah and hamas include by wave flag of proscribe organisation word as other have say have tragic consequence beloved colleague jo cox and sir david amess be tragically murder and june remain one of the bad day of my life know many colleague in this house feel the same we all have duty to prevent that from ever happen again welcome the minister comment about glastonbury do he agree that itunes spotify youtube and other should strongly consider take the group music off their platform until the police investigation be over may also note the absence of the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn who be not present and not involve in this discussion will the minister join in condemn the right hon member for islington north appearance in photograph with the group and in call for he to apologise for that order may remind member that if they make specific reference to

house to do everything that we possibly can to conduct our politic in responsible and reasonable way as do other he mention glastonbury and be grateful to he for the care and attention with which he have write to the festival organiser he hear my early comment hear his remark about streaming platform my sense be that there be lot of agreement from member from right across the house with respect be not aware of the other matter he mention and be keen not to annoy madam deputy speaker so will not refer to the right hon gentleman who be not in his place on this occasion give the proximity of my constituency to the glastonbury festival many local people be concerned to learn that pop group promote harmful and extremist rhetoric be schedule to perform there this summer what criterion do the home office apply when assess whether artist or performer be promote harmful or extremist rhetoric particularly when there be clear attempt to provoke public outrage also will the minister work with and my hon friend the member for wells and mendip hills tessa munt to engage with the glastonbury festival organiser on find an appropriate resolution yes be happy to do all the thing that the hon lady ask she mention funding hope that she hear the remark that make early not least about the government think that individual express such view should not receive taxpayer funding do not think that be controversial thing to say the secretary of state for culture media and sport be review the music export growth scheme on the hon lady point about the glastonbury festival organiser suspect and hope that as neighbouring mp she will have good and constructive relationship with they also very much hope that they have listen to what she have say the comment make by this group be chilling and disgusting and they risk drag our politic and our country to very dangerous place echo the comment of my hon friend the member for north durham luke akehurst when go to school in my constituency the message take to young people be you have place in politic you can represent your community you can make change do my hon friend agree that incitement to violence and violence against mps have chilling effect particularly on people from under represent group in our country they push those people not to get involve in politic which be deeply wrong my hon friend make really important point and agree wholeheartedly with it he be right about the chilling effect it would absolutely extend to young people as well as old people and other it apply to anyone consider step forward to serve in public life the strength of our democracy and our country depend on people who be prepared to step forward and serve their constituent as member of this house and we need to ensure that people feel that they can do that without be subject to completely unnecessary harassment and intimidation that be why key theme of the defend democracy taskforce be incident of harassment and intimidation and whether there be gap in legislation where there be gap we will fill they every time come to this house stand underneath the plaque for jo cox and look over at the plaque for david amess it seem impossible that within year two of our colleague could have be murder be grateful to my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois for raise this question because it give we moment to reflect when read the word the only good tory be dead tory kill your local mp and up hamas up hezbollah can not see what time interval need to pass before that be deem an offence entirely recognise what the minister say about these process need to happen independently but speed of justice contribute to confidence in justice as former art minister who work to support mass of creative group probably very few of which support or my party be clear head about the use of the music export growth scheme hope that the minister who know to be decent man will in his work on the defend democracy taskforce proactively ensure that no taxpayer money go to any organisation or creative group that use language that have such negative effect on the way that politics be conduct and the way that we in this place be see agree with the right hon gentleman he be right to say that the urgent question have provide we with moment to reflect the word that he repeat completely understand why he choose to repeat they be utterly vile they make my blood boil also agree with the other point that he make he know as former senior minister about the importance of the operational independence of the police but he make his point in very reasonable way and it will have be hear finally on his comment about funding he be absolutely right again that be why the secretary of state as matter of urgency will now look at these matter it be good to hear that the house be unite in its condemnation of the appalling comment by this band incite hatred and support terrorism and our thought and prayer today be with the family of jo cox and sir david amess do the minister agree that there can never be any excuse for incite violence against mps or for support the vile antisemitic terrorist of hamas and hezbollah and that threat to mps be threat to democracy itself my hon friend be absolutely right there can never ever be any excuse for these kind of word this be not about free speech or artistic licence it be about incitement he be absolutely right to frame his question in the way that he have and can give he an assurance of the seriousness with which we take these matter thank the minister for his answer kneecap so call apology simply underline their hatred and refusal to see that they can not call for murder simply because they do not agree with political belief we know that they glorify ira terrorist campaign and they make no apology for that no one can support group who be proscribe and this must be deal with look to the minister in particular since the responsibility lie on his shoulder and ask he how he will send the appropriate message from this house that although we may not agree politically there be line and kneecap have cross that line there be right and wrong and if someone have do wrong they be accountable in law for it so no half hearted grudging fake apology will suffice they need to be bring to justice by the police and take to court well still put they in jail agree with the hon member and think he frame the appropriate message very effectively himself he be right to say that it be never acceptable to utter the kind of word that we have hear today and this government take these matter incredibly seriously he will also have hear the agreement make early to meet the leader of political party in northern ireland of course be happy to meet the political leader of any party to discuss these matter be grateful to he for his contribution do the minister agree that there be no context at all in which it would be acceptable to utter the remark attribute to this group do he hope as do that the criminal justice system pursue they with the utmost rigour without any thought to mitigation such as so call artistic licence do he share my disappointment as south west mp that as of this afternoon glastonbury be still list this outfit for performance on saturday june certainly agree with the right hon gentleman with regard to there be no excuse whatsoever for these remark know that he will understand the limitation place on with regard to what be an ongoing live investigation by the police but the word that he have use be entirely reasonable and appropriate with regard to glastonbury he will have hear the contribution make by other hon member and the word that use early with regard to the organiser of that festival consider whether it be appropriate to have in their line up group who be currently subject to live police investigation hope very much that they will take that seriously and listen to the concern that have be express by member right across this house the phrase kill your local mp carry sincerely sinister connotation right across this house to my party which have lose councillor member of the northern ireland parliament and members of this house to republican terrorist those word be not clever or smart they be an incitement to terrorist activity which this band have glorify in the past this band present real danger through what they call their art of glorify the action that cause the murder and death of so many people in northern ireland can the minister give reassurance that the government will do all in their power to look not just at what have be say in the recent video that have come to light but at what the band have say in the past as he look to glastonbury and give the organiser advice will he also look at forthcoming event in belfast and provide belfast city council with the same advice can give the hon member that reassurance the word we have hear be chill anywhere in any corner of this united kingdom but completely understand the point he make and the particular significance they will have in his constituency and his part of the world so can give he the reassurance he seek the minister have point about the name an irish republican band with name that must send shudder down the spine of so many in northern ireland and which the hon and gallant minister choose not to use ought to have raise alarm bell long before they get their hand on any public money be there any prospect of get that money back agree with the sentiment express by the right hon gentleman on the issue of the money that be something the secretary of state will be look closely at in northern ireland the term kneecap be relate to violent criminal act when grouping take that as their name express desire for mp to be murder and support proscribe organisation like hezbollah and hamas we have to question why they have be award so much uk taxpayer money yesterday take the opportunity to write to the us and canadian authority ask they to refuse any visa application from these hatemonger ahead of their publicise tour of north america to prevent they from spread their violent message across the world will the minister join in lobby for that as the hon member may be aware be not to the same extent as herself intimately familiar with the connotation of the name from my previous professional experience so completely understand why she have make the point in the way that she have let undertake to go away and think more specifically about the point she have raise but be happy to discuss they far with she or with any of her colleague should she wish to do so if this band remain on the bill at glastonbury this year will the minister undertake on behalf of the government that no ministers will attend the whole festival be not intend to attend myself let reflect on the question not least because be not responsible for other ministers diary however as have say previously be sure be certainly hopeful that the organiser of glastonbury will be listen to the contribution that have be make and will reflect on the decision that they have previously take thank the minister for the tone and manner in which he have answer question be cognisant of the ongoing legal action that may be pursue in this case so to generalise the point little how be the government ensure that public funding mechanism such as the music export growth scheme be not inadvertently support entity that propagate extremist rhetoric and incitement to violence this be not just about the money it be about the official imprimatur that scheme like that offer to the entity involve the hon member make an entirely reasonable and legitimate point about the public funding say again that the secretary of state for culture media and sport be review the scheme and be sure that she will have more to say about it in the not too distant future the minister have respond to the urgent question and give an unequivocal condemnation which be sure be share across the house do he understand though that many of we have suffer threat down through the year we have the plaque in the chamber for those who have suffer and pay the ultimate sacrifice do he agree that while that condemnation be universal across the chamber our comment amount to diddly squat for the group concern but the action that follow from the minister word would matter will he come back to the house after he have take the action he have undertake to take to update member and the general public on they be grateful for and completely understand the point the hon member make which he make in fair reasonable way give he that commitment to come back and update the house give he my personal assurance of the importance that attach to these matter chair the defend democracy taskforce have personally invest huge amount of time and effort work closely with official not just in the home office but right across government it be an important mechanism that bring together the collective resource of the uk government and it be on to ensure that those resource be properly marshal in the right place at the right time so that we can be ambitious about ensure that people be not subject to completely unacceptable harassment and intimidation give he the assurance that will do everything possibly can work with colleague across government and would be happy to speak to he and to come back and update the house accordingly an apology to the family of david amess and jo cox be the only slim chance for redemption the use of incite language be to be condemn when it become apparent just as violence against elect representative be always to be condemn politic be about be alert to the right to use word powerfully and the risk and responsibility of do so do the minister agree therefore that it be right and necessary to condemn incendiary language and to ensure freedom of speech right across the political spectrum yes agree be in wales recently where discuss these matter with the first minister as mention early it be very much the government intention that our approach and response be not just conduct at the uk government national level but be wire through local authority and the devolved assembly be acutely conscious of the fact that election will be take place in wales next year and want to ensure that everybody who participate in those election can do so in safe and secure way want to work with the first minister the right hon member and all her colleague in wales to ensure that that be the case join in the condemnation from across the political spectrum in this house and from the minister of the comment from this group which be abhorrent evil and twisted do the minister agree that any local government authority think especially of belfast city council that be allow group such as these to use their property for concert should rethink that policy will he give further commitment that he will contact belfast city council to ensure that this group be not allow to use council property for spew out sectarian hate and evil comment be grateful to the hon member for the point he have raise all public body have an absolute responsibility to ensure that taxpayer money be spend in an appropriate way will take away the comment he have make and reflect on they and be happy to correspond with he far about they be the minister confident that the exist framework that prevent public fund from be use to platform individual and group who seek to stoke division be robust as the hon member will understand these public fund have not be allocate via my department so will look carefully at the point he have make as say early the secretary of state for culture media and sport be look carefully and review this scheme however as have just say to the hon member for north down alex easton all public body and certainly all departments have an absolute responsibility to ensure that taxpayer money be spend wisely and that be the approach that this government will take with the scale of imprisonment that we have see in recent month for those who make inappropriate comment on social medium do the minister agree that confidence in police and the prosecution service be on the line in this appalling incitement to murder and that such confidence require action against this group group that have make their hateful career out of advocate and support terrorism be it hamas hezbollah or the ira in that regard will the minister consider the adequacy of the offence of glorification of terrorism which have so many let out that such group be adept at exploit and need to be tighten up will he do that as consequence of this episode the police and the crown prosecution service have difficult job to do in general term and be determined not to make it more difficult in these circumstance the hon and learn gentleman second point be reasonable will reflect on it and come back to he every time member enter this chamber they walk through door that have plaque in memory of robert bradford airey neave and ian gow who be murder by the ira simply because they serve as mps this group have through their music glorify that kind of terrorism just as sinn féin have do on regular basis in northern ireland right up to the level of first minister to that extent the group could be call the musical wing of sinn féin will the minister assure we that he will encourage the police to investigate this quickly that the funding formula will no long allow such group to obtain funding and that he will do his good to deny the group any further platform suspect that their panicked apology be more about get visa for their lucrative tour in canada and america than it be about be sorry for what they have do incitement to violence be completely unacceptable and there be never an excuse for it the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to mention the former member of this house who lose their life serve their constituent and our country underline again the government commitment and determination to ensure that all of we in this place and all who serve in public life can do so safely and securely he speak about the investigation as have say that be on the way but take and understand his point about speed he will understand that have already respond to the point about funding the secretary of state will look at that as will other departments be sure the right hon gentleman be right to refer to the fact that member of this house who have serve their constituent in good faith have lose their life in so do that be utterly vile we all have responsibility to ensure that it do not happen again that be the body of work of the defend democracy taskforce will ensure that it mean we be well place to address the threat that we all know about on point of order madam deputy speaker my understanding as new mp be that there be long stand convention by which member who intend to refer to another member during proceeding particularly in critical or contentious manner should inform that member in advance that courtesy give the member concern the opportunity to be present and if necessary to respond early reference be make to the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn without prior notice seek your guidance on whether that be in keep with the expect standard of conduct in the chamber thank the hon member for advance notice of his point of order have he be in the chamber at the time he would have hear make exactly that point it be courtesy of this house that

and israel live side by side in peace dignity and security the visit be significant step in strengthen our relationship with the palestinian authority key partner for peace in the middle east at this critical moment commend this statement to the house call the shadow foreign secretary be grateful to the minister for advance sight of his statement the government mou fail to stand up to credible scrutiny as it fail to outline in any way how it will help to achieve meaningful end to the conflict the mou say that the pa be the only legitimate govern entity across the west bank east jerusalem and gaza and that the uk government want to see the pa run all three there clearly can not be any future for hamas we completely agree with that but how will the minister and the government bring this about without strategy for the removal of the terrorist hamas regime in gaza have ask this question many time from the dispatch box but the government simply have no answer there be commitment in the mou that the palestinian authority will hold presidential and parliamentary election in the shortest feasible timeframe what be that timeframe who be dictate that timetable what mechanism be be put in place for election and have this be support by arab partner and neighbour who be signatory to the cairo plan to rebuild gaza do the minister believe that the palestinian authority in their current form be capable of hold free and fair election if not be it the government intention to provide election assistance how would the government rule out hamas be able to run in those election there be nothing explicit in the mou about plan to ensure that terrorist infrastructure in gaza be dismantle once and for all which be inexplicable what dialogue have take place with key middle eastern ally since the cairo plan for gaza be publish on the question of recognition of palestinian state the government approach be incoherent and the mou provide no clarity on the long term intention condition or timing of this happening do the minister agree that we be not at the point of recognition and that recognition can not be the start of the process there be no mention anywhere in the mou of effort to build upon the abraham accord as way of achieve regional stability despite the accord provide the framework to support and finance new future for palestine and support two state solution be effort to expand the accord discuss with the palestinian authority leadership yesterday on the economic front the mou talk about boost trade but what kind of increase be we look at in value term give all the instability in the region in which sector be the government now pursue trade and will this involve the uk government spend money on trade promotion measure why be there no mention of welfare reform in pa control territory which we know be in dire need of urgent attention meanwhile the reference to education be extremely vague and unsatisfactory it need to be much clear and set proper parameter so that there be clear plan for educate and upskille whole generation who have be poorly serve by their political leader for too long can the minister confirm whether he hold discussion with the pa about the urgent need for they to do everything in their power to banish antisemitism from palestinian school textbook can he provide any detail on the opaque commitment to education scientific and cultural exchange what form will those take can the minister clarify what exactly the million he announce yesterday will go towards which organisation will be entrust with the money and whether unrwa the united nations relief and works agency will receive any of it what specific programme will it fund the entire document contain only brief mention of the need to tackle corruption which be inadequate what be his assessment of the current corruption level and the pa leadership effort to deal with it what be his definition of progress the section on security co operation also need unpack and more accountability exactly how will security co operation be enhance and which global challenge and threat do the minister envisage jointly counter with the palestinian authority the mou also state the participant commit to action to uphold the right of woman and minority group and prevent the targeting of individual in these category do the minister believe that these right be be sufficiently uphold in the west bank at present indeed the question of full civil liberty include freedom of expression and medium freedom need serious attention the pa have their work cut out to prove their credibility there be section on climate change in the mou can the minister tell we exactly what be the good practice he be seek to learn from the palestinian authority when it come to tackle climate change on the current conflict what have this government do since the house last meet on this issue to support international effort to secure the release of those poor hostage who remain in such cruel captivity in gaza finally turn to iran if we be serious about sustainable peace we must address the root cause of this terrible suffering we still have no clarity from the government about how they see the uk work with the us administration so will give the minister another opportunity to answer that question will he furnish we with the government official response on the legal attempt here in the uk to challenge the proscription of hamas the shadow foreign secretary ask many question let be clear the british government see the palestinian authority as vital partner and they be vital partner that must go through reform the new prime minister have show leadership on that reform agenda and have make progress on range of issue the right hon lady raise number of important issue one be the content of textbook an issue on which we have discussion with the palestinian authority and which have discuss with other party who have strong view understandably on the importance of ensure that both community be raise with belief in co existence rather than hatred there be range of other very important reform question that be at issue one of they on which the prime minister have show real leadership be the so call pay to slay arrangement progress have be make on that and we must encourage the palestinian authority in those reform effort the memorandum of understanding be intend to provide framework to upgrade that co operation because the palestinian authority be the vital partner for peace the right hon lady rightly ask what we will do to ensure that hamas leave the gaza strip and do not play governance role one of the most important thing we can do be ensure that there be serious and credible alternative to hamas and that must be the palestinian authority which be what our effort be aim at the right hon lady ask two important question about the uk government position in relation to iran we welcome the talk between the united states of america and iran be in oman after the first stage of the talk and the foreign secretary have be there recently we be talk to all party and we want to see diplomatic solution to the nuclear weapon threat that iran pose not just to the region but to the world we hope that these talk will prove successful the right hon lady ask reasonably about the allocation of the million be not in position to give full breakdown of exactly where the money will go though will provide the house with that breakdown would anticipate that funding be direct to unrwa and the palestinian authority directly but once we have full programmatic detail we will return to the house with that breakdown we be talk to partner about those allocation and be happy to come back in writing on some of the more detailed question lastly we support the abraham accord be very pleased while the right hon lady be there to sign the uk up to an agreement with bahrain and the us which include explicit reference to the abraham accord we be support the abraham accord not just in our word but in our action call the chair of the foreign affairs committee at the meeting last night between the foreign affairs committee and the palestinian prime minister and his delegation it be clear that they be very encouraged by the discussion they have have with the prime minister and the foreign secretary and rightly so because the memorandum of understanding show serious thinking about the long term future of israel and palestine and leadership towards peace do my hon friend agree that now be the time to take the next serious step which be to finally recognise the state of palestine the good time to do that might be alongside the french in new york in june thank my right hon friend for her question and her courteous treatment of the palestinian prime minister last night the question of recognition be raise repeatedly in this house our position remain the same we do wish to recognise palestinian state and we wish to do so as contribution to two state solution we will make the judgment about when the good moment be to try to make the full possible contribution as say to the palestinian prime minister this morning our responsibility be for the reality of the situation on the ground the practical viability of palestinian state of course other state have take different position from the uk government and choose to recognise palestinian state that have not call it into existence our job in the british government be to make practical contribution to two state solution and that be how we intend to approach this issue call the liberal democrat spokesperson be glad to see the prime minister and foreign secretary meet the palestinian authority prime minister mustafa and reaffirm this country support for two state solution palestinian state as part of wide two state solution remain the only path to long term peace and security for both israelis and palestinians the liberal democrats have call for the immediate recognition of the state of palestine ask the minister this question most week and will ask it again and hope the position will change one week follow yesterday meeting will the government now take this vital step and commit to work with international partner such as france on issue joint recognition statement now be the time for restoration of the ceasefire the release of the hostage and return to the political process this government have pledge million package of support for the occupied palestinian territories include for humanitarian relief that be welcome yet for more than day israel have block aid from enter gaza and shutter border crossing point as result the food stock of the un world food programme which previously reach half of gaza population have entirely run out the risk of starvation disease and death be very real even as tonne of food aid languish at border checkpoint in joint statement with french and german counterpart the foreign secretary call this intolerable and rightly so but what be the government do to end the blockade and ensure that aid can flow into gaza the international court of justice have open hearing on israel responsibility to facilitate humanitarian relief in gaza will the government commit to abide by the court judgment two week ago the government say that they continue to consider the icj opinion on the opt can the minister update the house on when we can finally expect the government response the government have also reaffirm their condemnation of violent west bank settler activity but what concrete step be be take to pressure israel to act on illegal settlement finally will the government now consider sanction on those israeli ministers such as smotrich and ben gvir who encourage settler violence have set out the position on recognition in previous answer and be afraid that will have to test the hon lady patience because on sanction will also set out the position which be very familiar we do not comment on sanction in advance as to do so might impact their effectiveness can confirm however that we have raise these issue include the blockade of aid as she have identify we issue statement with our european partner last week and the foreign secretary raise this with his counterpart on april welcome the work that special envoy sir michael barber will be do in the palestinian authority when be work in pakistan as diplomat see the excellent work they be do in build the public sector do the minister agree however that that work will be futile if israel continue to undermine the pa by take step towards the annexation of the west bank and what step be the government take to ensure that this do not happen join my hon friend in what he say about sir michael barber we be both in pakistan at similar time and both see the excellent work he do on girl education there and welcome his vital role in relation to the palestinian authority have be clear as have the foreign secretary about our position on settlement they be illegal under international law and we oppose completely any annexation of the west bank the foreign secretary rightly say in his statement yesterday that hamas have no future in any of the possible way forward for palestine and for gaza that be statement of the obvious but what be the government strategy for palestine in particular give that the minister avoid the point make by my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel what discussion have he have with the americans because it seem to that the trump plan for gaza in particular be very different from any conceivable plan that the uk government might have the right hon gentleman one of my predecessor ask what our plan for palestine be our support to the palestinian authority be an important element of our work in israel and the occupied palestinian territories they must be at the centre of the effort to ensure that there can be future for both palestine and israel that involve two safe and secure state side by side we of course speak regularly to our us counterpart across the whole range of issue in my area in many area we may diverge but we continue to have very close relationship and discuss these matter closely as my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry mention member of the foreign affairs committee meet the palestinian authority prime minister yesterday he be steadfast in his comment to we on his advocacy for peace for the people in gaza in the west bank and the occupy territory and in israel those of we on the labour side of the house stand on manifesto that state palestinian statehood be the inalienable right of the palestinian people it be not in the gift of any neighbour and be also essential to the long term security of israel the minister have be ask this question before but the time to recognise the state of palestine be long overdue the time be now when will the uk finally recognise the state of palestine my hon friend be commit to these issue know that she have travel to the region recently and have long history of advocacy as do so many in this house as say in my previous answer the role of the british government must be to try and practically bring about the safety and security that two state can provide and we will consider recognition in that context as have be mention by colleague on the foreign affairs committee yesterday we meet the prime minister of the palestinian authority he outline to we their plan for the running of gaza once the conflict be over however the palestinian authority be also in desperate need of long overdue reform hamas rule of gaza have be an absolute disaster for the gazan people but the future of gaza can not be for the palestinian authority to run gaza in the same fashion in which they have be run the west bank what guarantee do the government have that the pa be go to undertake those reform to their governance to the corruption issue and to the rule of law that be desperately need so that the people of gaza have well future central element of our discussion with the palestinian prime minister be that reform agenda the palestinian prime minister be relatively new in his position and as say to the right hon member for witham priti patel he have make some important commitment and important practical change and we must support the palestinian authority to reform in order to well serve the palestinian people may put on record my thank to the minister for his statement today and commend he and the foreign secretary for secure this landmark memorandum of understanding with the palestinian government follow my meeting yesterday with prime minister mustafa can the minister tell this house how the mou and the million for the occupied palestinian territories will allow the palestinian authority to reform and provide crucial public service to the palestinian people it be sign of the palestinian authority commitment to some of these practical question of service delivery that their health minister travel with the prime minister for discussion the mou provide framework through which we can have that reform discussion include strategic dialogue on whole range of question such as the important education question that the right hon member for witham priti patel raise early for how long do the minister think he will be able to recognise palestinian state that retain sufficient economically viable land to actually be goer the right hon gentleman raise an important question about the economic viability of the occupy palestinian territories and what any future state of palestine would rely on for its economy there clearly be very important question to be consider about energy water and the area themselves clearly many of these issue have be consider as final status determination issue envisage for the end of two state solution conference we be do everything we can to try and support the most practical measure possible to enable the palestinians to live the most dignified life that they can may place on record my thank to the minister for all the work that he and the secretary of state be do on the mou which be very welcome on the question ask by my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry the chair of the foreign affairs committee appreciate that we stand on that manifesto and rightly so but thing have since change the government position be that we would continue recognition as part of the peace process but israel have be block aid to gaza for day now people be start to die of starvation settler violence be increase in the west bank and we now have an mou so be this not the right time to review our position will the minister at least commit to go away and review the decision and give the palestinians the state recognition that they be way overdue my hon friend be very committed to these issue and raise they with here and elsewhere will not restate the position but will once again confirm from the dispatch box our commitment to our manifesto and that we consider recognition an inalienable right of the palestinian people however it must be part of the practical step take to bring the violence to an end and peaceful resolution to the region refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests give that the horrific attack of october be perpetrate by hamas that hostage still remain in captivity in gaza that those attack be carry out with the support and participation of many gazans and that there be senior palestinian authority diplomat who openly celebrate those attack do the minister not think that unilaterally recognise palestinian statehood at this moment would constitute reward for terrorism rather than the fruit of peaceful negotiation the right hon lady refer to the condition of the hostage last night along with my hon friend the member for wirral west matthew patrick attend presentation by eli sharabi who have british family member and be take by hamas on october and hold in the most unimaginably cruel condition he be release only to discover that the british passport that be hold by his family as source of protection be not enough to save they and be not enough to prevent the killing of his brother metre from he in tunnel the whole house remain focused on the hostage who remain in unknown condition probably deep underground anyone who have anything to do with that can have no role in the future of gaza it be in part out of our determination that hamas must leave the strip that our support for the palestinian authority be so important welcome the significant strengthening of tie between the uk and the palestinian authority not just in trade and extra funding from the uk but because as the foreign secretary say last night the uk be commit to urgently advance palestinian statehood as key part of two state solution it be my pleasure last night to meet not just prime minister mustafa but basel adra the director of the oscar win documentary no other land who make clear that recognition be his central demand too do the minister therefore agree with that president macron be right when he say last month that we must move towards recognition and we will do so in the come month welcome my hon friend engagement and commitment to these issue will not rehearse the position that have set out already on recognition two week ago have the privilege to speak on behalf of the uk parliament at the inter parliamentary union where over mp from country pass resolution support two state solution no one vote against it there be plenty of notice of the uk not recognise nation state last night ask the palestinian prime minister what difference it would make if the uk recognise palestinian state and he reply that it would be paradigm change new platform it all start with that recognition give the crucial meeting between the uk prime minister and the palestinian prime minister as equal what practical impediment stand in the way of now recognise palestine as nation state hear repeatedly that we be look for practical solution so will the minister explain that to the house owe to time constraint will not rehearse the vital question about security and governance that will clearly need to underpin two state solution in which both state be able to live in peace security and co operation those final status determination have long be vex while we be committed to the inalienable right of the palestinians to state as part of two state solution let we not pretend that there be not vex issue at the centre of what palestinian state would look like that be one reason why so much diplomacy have be focus on these issue over the year warmly welcome the minister statement and thank he for bring an extensive range of expertise to his role do he agree with that it be only right for british government minister to ask search question of both the pa and the israeli government will he reassure that he will continue to ask question about accountability for the killing of humanitarian worker who be try to perform their duty thank my hon friend for his kind word and for his dedication to these issue clearly there have be an absolutely tragic loss of life among aid worker who be deliver vital service in gaza we all remember that year ago tragic incident kill seven aid worker from the world central kitchen include james henderson john chapman and james kirby three british national who remain in our thought it have be more than year and we expect an update on the investigation by the israeli military advocate general we want to see full justice and accountability for british national affect by violence include in relation to the strike in march on un building in which british national be seriously injure over the course of this devastating conflict more than aid worker have be kill our demand be drive by nothing other than desire to protect the life of humanitarian worker and demand accountability for those who be kill if our prime minister can meet the prime minister of the palestinian authority and if the united kingdom government can enter into memorandum of understanding with the government of the palestinian authority what barrier can remain to the united kingdom recognise the state of palestine as matter of logic gently suggest to the right hon member that that logic do not wholly follow there be complex final status determination issue that would underpin any recognition no two state solution will be straightforward without significant negotiation diplomacy and agreement on both side as have set out recognition remain our goal but let we not pretend that it be straightforward decision without complexity in his remark yesterday the palestinian prime minister quite rightly remind mps of the uk historic moral and legal obligation to the palestinian people the importance of our action to uphold international law today can not be underestimate so must ask the minister why the uk be still reluctant to sanction israel for its war crime against the palestinians why be the government deepen our trade tie with israel as the international court of justice warn country not to assist or aid illegal occupation finally ask the minister to listen to the grow call in this chamber and announce when the government will finally recognise the state of palestine our position be clear on international humanitarian law and on the importance of accountability will not test your patience madam deputy speaker by again go through the point about recognition in be one of conservative who vote in this house for recognition of palestine since then government have come and go and thousand of life on both side have be lose the minister say few minute ago that he could not go into the full detail but be sure it would be helpful if not today in the very near future to member from across the house for he to provide detailed analysis of what need to change before recognition can take place be confident that will be back in this house to talk about the detail of recognition soon as another member of this house who vote in to recognise the state of palestine in motion that this house pass will say that progress on this matter be long overdue hope the minister have hear loud and clear the message from many of we that continue to delay that be problematic the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne might be surprised that agree with he there be concern about what will be leave of the state of palestine despite the existence of thermographic technology israeli force be now burn to the ground the agricultural field in northern gaza in apparent pursuit of the tunnel that hamas be use for their terrorist attack we know that nearly child in gaza have be diagnose as suffer from acute malnutrition we all desperately want to see aid resume to palestine because we know that there be no future for any state if people be starve to death will the minister update we on the practical detail he discuss last night with the palestinian authority about how we will get food back into gaza and get movement in this process my hon friend raise important question about the viability of the palestinian state the occupied palestinian territories must not be reduce either geographically or by force displacement and be happy to reiterate that point at the dispatch box there be clearly an urgent crisis the world food programme have say that it have now run out of food in the gaza strip the single most important measure that can be take to address that crisis be an end to the blockade of aid into the gaza strip and that be what we continue to call for can invite the minister to bring great sense of urgency to the situation there be child starve to death in gaza and die for lack of medicine there be no water and hardly any power go in the hospital be not function that be all disaster make by the deliberate action of the israel defence forces what action be the minister take to ensure that the blockade end and that food medicine and all the necessity for life go in those people who be die of starvation can see food over the fence in israel but they be be deliberately starve to death as say in my previous answer we be clear that the single most significant contribution that can be take on that problem be end the blockade of gaza we have be clear with the israeli government at the high level include on april in the meeting between the foreign secretary and his israeli equivalent that that blockade must be lift on the long term question of health and some of the other basic social service will say that of course we discuss those issue with the palestinian authority and relevant ministers over the past two day as the right hon gentleman say this be very urgent and the world food programme have be clear that be why we make the statement over the weekend it be sober yesterday listen to dr mustafa the prime minister of the palestinian authority not least as he stress the uk government leadership role and the importance of the recognition of the state of palestine bear in mind that leadership role and the fact that jurisdiction already recognise that state will the minister explain to the house today the reason for the impediment to that recognition it be really important that we hear that because we be here to hold the government to account some state have recognise palestinian state yet no palestinian state be fully function that underline the importance of take the practical measure that will be absolutely vital not only to support palestinian life but to ensure that two state can co exist peacefully side by side many member have refer to some of the practical impediment whether it be the removal of hamas from the gaza strip or the economic challenge that face the palestinian territory in both the west bank and gaza let be clear an extremely violent conflict continue without ceasefire it be hard to imagine the creation of state be sure that we will continue to discuss the merit of recognition but let we not pretend that there be not serious practical consideration to bear in mind before the practical establishment of palestinian state be possible the british government be focus on change the actual fact on the ground that be the approach that we will take other hon and right hon member have talk about what might be leave in palestine but will ask about who might be leave some of the pregnant woman there that be pregnant woman be so malnourished that their pregnancy be now high risk that really undermine the future of palestine population what assurance can the minister give we that the million will be direct to those people who really need it as have say already once we have fully allocate the funding we will return to the house to outline how it have be prioritise be pleased to see that the foreign secretary along with france and germany strongly condemn the use of humanitarian aid as political tool the minister will know very well that the only way to bring peace and stability to the region be by work together with our network of ally bear that in mind what conversation have he have with our european and international ally about the palestinian lead planning of recovery and reconstruction in gaza as outline in yesterday excellent memorandum of understanding my hon friend ask important question the foreign secretary and and the whole ministerial team be engage with our international partner we have make number of statement with european partner with the qataris on sunday when the foreign secretary travel to qatar and in oman to which the foreign secretary and travel recently we be engage with many other important partner in the region include egypt israel and many other we have hear member across the house ask about recognition and sanction yesterday join private briefing organise by the palestinian ngo network medical aid for palestinians oxfam international save the children the norwegian refugee council and the association of international development agencies the message take away which be burn into my brain be that on the ground food water and medicine the essential of life have all run out as the minister say baby milk and the water need to make it be not available would the uk government response be the same if the people who be starve and deny water and medicine be in ukraine god forbid and if russia be the perpetrator the uk seek to play its full role in every humanitarian crisis we have conduct important conference on sudan and have attend to issue in ukraine and the occupied palestinian territories we act wherever we can to try to avert humanitarian suffering welcome the minister statement in particular the announcement of million for humanitarian aid and the signing of the memorandum of understanding the minister have reconfirm his commitment to two state solution however in order to have two state solution we need to recognise both state what criterion be be use to assess when the time be right to recognise palestine as state if the minister be not able to provide detailed response today be happy to receive one in writing thank my hon friend for his question there be no end of detail to discuss in relation to recognition and be sure that we will return to this house to discuss it far of course when we talk of two state solution we envisage two recognise state live peacefully together provide for their joint safety and security that be implicit in our long stand support for two state solution in his statement the minister say that there could be no role for hamas in the future of gaza support that but there can be no future for gaza unless the killing and destruction end that be why in september last year it be welcome that the government suspend arm export licence follow concern that there be risk that they could be use by the israelis to break international law in gaza however further export licence to israel be grant between september and december last year more than be originally block can the minister explain that decision and provide the late number of arm licence to israel that have be approve in september we set out the basis on which we choose to suspend arm licence and that basis remain there be not full restriction on provide licence many licence be provide either for dual use good or for good that could not possibly be use for the activity that have cause concern for example licence would be issue for body armour use by non governmental organisation worker in gaza there be also item for the legitimate defence of israel such as component that could enable its missile defence system to defend it against iranian drone do not have the exact number of licence it tend to change relatively regularly give the nature of the flow between the two country too welcome the mou and the funding we will provide to the palestinian authority when go to jerusalem last year with other member we talk to the ngo community an absolutely vital community in both israel and palestine work for democracy and human right on may the knesset be plan to vote on another law that will clamp down on the activity of ngos work to help build two state solution the law will impose an tax on donation from foreign state entity include the united kingdom and ban access to court for ngos what discussion have the minister have with counterpart in israel to ensure that our state funding can go to towards build that two state solution with both israeli and palestinian ngos we support effort by both israeli and palestinian civil society actor to build link across community and know that many in this house have engage with organisation of that kind we be aware of the draft legislation in the knesset and we be engage with colleague in israel on these question today the international court of justice hear that israel be commit genocide in gaza under the world watchful eye all of we be witness to the most horrific crime against humanity which be be carry out in plain sight million child have be cut off from the basic necessity for survival for well over month they be at risk of starvation repeat those word million child be at risk of starve to death fear that once this be over and do with and all be say and do we will make mere memorial to mark the most horrific war crime of our time this be tragedy that the world have the power to stop but be refuse to what more can the government do to ensure that the civilian population of gaza include million child be not starve to death and why be it not be do the government be in no doubt about the severity of the humanitarian situation in gaza that be why last week we make statement both with our ally and alone about the politicisation of humanitarian aid and the urgent situation that the un agency be report more than of gaza population have be displace and many have be displace repeatedly many member of this house have hear harrowing tale of resident of the gaza strip simply try to survive return to their home only to find it totally destroy or try to find medical assistance as hospital across the strip go out of operation the government be in no doubt about the severity of the situation and we raise it with the emphasis that the hon gentleman would expect commend my hon friend on all the work he be do know that huge amount be go on behind the scene and particularly on the memorandum of understanding and the additional funding when host meeting of the britain palestine all party parliamentary group last night it be quite clear how grateful prime minister mustafa be for the stance that the uk be take and that he see it as part of sequence of step towards recognition yes he want that as soon as possible but he recognise the step that need to be take because of the difficult international context to ensure that recognition would make difference however who among our other ally either the or the five eye except the us obviously have provide similar sort of mou that can be build on will have to revert to my hon friend on whether other have memorandum of understanding the european union and other have do important work with the palestinian authority but be very grateful for the word of the palestinian prime minister last night in parliament he have particularly recognise the importance of the uk work on the reform agenda and on many other thing for which be very grateful more than child have be murder more than woman have be murder and more than innocent man have be murder the minister use the word contribution when make reference to two state solution ask he whether the contribution of all those who have be murder the blood that have be spill be not sufficient for palestine to be recognise as state as say in my last answer we be incredibly conscious of the suffering in gaza we want to see ceasefire we want political process and we want two state live securely side by side and all our diplomatic effort in relation to this question be focus on that in his meeting with mps the palestinian prime minister be clear that israel will change course only if there be real action from state he stress that in line with the international court of justice ruling state have legal responsibility to impose sanction include end all trade in settlement good and to cease any aid or assistance that sustain israel illegal occupation of palestinian territory those measure be back by significant number of mps across this house when will the government finally impose meaningful sanction in order to hold israel accountable and apply the pressure need to stop it trample all over international law without any consequence rightly the government do that for russia wrongly they will not do it for israel be grateful to my hon friend for his question but would gently correct he as he know this government have take step since we become the government include sanction he also know that we do not comment on sanction in advance of issue they the minister be good man and his answer indicate just that so read with interest the release on the government website regard the visit see the language refer to the occupied palestinian territories do the minister not agree that government language must be consider and unbiased while we welcome dialogue and we hope for peace to achieve that we can not and must not roll over and use narrative that be not helpful and useful we must be careful that the government do not sow division and distrust with our israeli ally thank the hon gentleman for his kind word the term occupy palestinian territories have long be the language of the british government under multiple different government and it reflect our legal view of the position welcome the government commitment to secure peaceful future for the region but that future feel far away for the family of the hostage still hold by hamas as the minister mention yesterday he and hear from eli sharabi who talk about the horror of his experience and how he lose absolutely everything he be work tirelessly to secure the release of all hostage include avinatan or who have british link do the minister agree that the first step in secure the peaceful future we all want to see be the immediate release of all the hostage do and pay tribute to the work of my hon friend who have be tireless supporter of hostage family include emily damari her mother mandy and of course avinatan or who be an israeli citizen with british mother he be very much in my thought as be all of those leave in tunnel for phase they be await ceasefire that can not come urgently enough join my hon friend in call for the immediate release of all hostage refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests the palestinian authority be key to two state solution and should be the basis of the viable palestinian state we all want to see welcome the minister focus on practical step to build up the palestinian authority think those be lot more important than statement that might be interpret as little performative can the minister update the house on the government work with the pa to improve the situation on the ground in the west bank include tackle the recent increase in iranian back terrorism there and the expansion of israeli settlement both of which represent major practical barrier to two state solution my hon friend raise important point and he have long history of engagement on these issue the security challenge in the west bank be important and he be right to raise they have set out our position on settlement clearly already from the dispatch box and reiterate that we be talk to the palestinian authority about those practical challenge and the importance of be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the palestinian security force to prevent violent disturbance within the area they control it be vital that settlement be restrain and that the terrible increase in settlement activity be reduce it be vital too that israel enable the palestinian authority to function effectively which include pay salary have electricity and all the other basic fundamental that nation state would require it be real honour to join the meeting with prime minister mustafa in parliament yesterday welcome the minister hard work in the signing of the mou desperately want peace for palestinians and for israelis and be touch by prime minister mustafa gracious remark that the way forward have to be peace for all dignity for all and justice for all do the minister agree that while we work through the short term practical consideration of recognise the state of palestine we have to keep our eye on that long term prize of peace dignity and justice and that state of palestine be vital part of that my hon friend be right those be the principle for long term peace for both party and that be what we will need to work towards the memorandum of understanding be significant and the message to the minister about the recognition of the state of palestine be equally significant member after member have raise the famine in gaza and its implication we be see picture of child who as result of malnutrition be not survive the hospital treatment they be get historically our country have be face with this situation before and we have overridden blockade we have not allow other country to veto humanitarian aid be we not near that stage now we can not allow israel to veto the delivery of aid should we not be look with our partner at the logistic we have on the ground in that region to deliver the aid by sea and by air whatever statement israel make with and without our partner we have look at range of mechanism whereby aid might be bring into gaza but the truth be that without effective deconfliction mechanism aid worker be at real risk as we have see in recent month and week there be also question of scale there have be airdrop and sea movement of aid into gaza but nothing can equal the scale require other than lift the blockade and that be what have be focus on after day hostage remain do the minister agree that their unconditional release be key to the ceasefire what do prime minister mustafa have to say about that yesterday thank my hon friend for his doughty advocacy in this regard prime minister mustafa tell that he want hostage to be release and be sure my hon friend will have see some of the other commentary from the palestinian authority on these question this be critical the hostage must be release as soon as possible and know the whole house continue to share that view maternity units requirement for bereavement suite motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require new maternity unit to have bereavement suite and for connected purpose for anyone experience the loss of baby that be already one of the most difficult time in their life it be make more difficult when they experience it in hospital maternity ward surround by mother and family celebrate new life no number of new facility can take the pain away but parent whose local hospital have dedicated bereavement suite away from the main labour ward can process that pain in privacy and peace be often inspire by my constituent in kettering and today be especially proud to introduce this bill inspire by the twinkling stars appeal which campaign for new maternity bereavement suite at kettering general hospital pay tribute to the northamptonshire health charity which have dedicate so much time and care to this appeal and also to sands which work to make sure that anyone affect by pregnancy or baby loss have the care and support that they need also want to recognise the work that the nhs be already do day in and day out staff at kettering general hospital help people who be go through one of the most difficult experience that anyone can imagine they continue to do that despite year of underfunding and understaffing which be testament to our hospital staff finally want to thank all the family who have be involve in this campaign and anyone who have donate help out at fundraising event sell mask during the pandemic to raise money or even do skydive the rockingham wing which be the maternity ward of kettering general be where be bear as premature baby eight week early it be where my mum fight for her life after complicated and traumatic birth which be make even more difficult as she be surround by happy healthy mother and their baby there be many people in kettering whose life like mine start in the rockingham wing so it be very alarming to hear in that it be crumble because of reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete be pleased to say that the raac be now be mitigate and two storey extension will be build behind the exist maternity unit to help the team to improve the care that they deliver each year to about family and their baby this will be particularly important in northamptonshire where we have grow population and many new family move into the area on recent visit to kettering general walk the ground of the new maternity ward see plan for the new bereavement suite and thank to the campaign by the northamptonshire health charity and the effort of local people see the place where it will be build before the appeal family in kettering who have lose baby either during pregnancy during the birth itself or through compassionate induction stay in room within the labour suite where mother could be close to their baby but not next to they and where partner walk through the maternity ward to reach they surround by the sound of new life and delighted parent make heartbreaking experience even hard kettere general hospital care for up to family year who lose baby they will now be care for in suite that have private bereavement room with en suite facility and cold cot for precious time with their baby it will have dedicated family room with kitchenette sofa bed peaceful private space for family to gather to support each other and quiet office space for bereavement midwife where sensitive conversation can be conduct with care and privacy at northampton hospital where some of these facility be already in place the daisy suite appeal aim to create somewhere for follow up care with specialist bereavement nurse that be not on the maternity ward so that when bereaved parent who have experience unique trauma return to the hospital they will not have to walk back through the same maternity ward again which could trigger painful memory bereavement midwife at northampton hospital write to in support of the campaign state come to hospital to give birth to baby who be know to have die or will die be unimaginable the grief and devastation can never be fully understand as each circumstance will be different what we can do as hospital be try our very good not to add to these feeling and make such an awful situation even bad by not provide supportive and understand environment we want they all to feel support hear and truly care for she explain that her team be currently base in the maternity ward but be not easily accessible for family to drop in for support and be difficult to find for staff member who be look for support themselves bereavement suite would allow they to see more family allow parent to return after discharge and spend more precious time with their baby and provide separate space where family do not come face to face with other pregnant woman and new bear baby while go through such heartbreaking time these campaign be base on real life experience the change be make to our maternity unit in hospital in northamptonshire be the result of what family have notice after experience bereavement themselves they want to make positive difference for future parent can not even begin to express the admiration have for parent who be take their pain and channel it into make thing well for those who come after they hon member hear hear some of the parent who contact mention the importance of quiet care when go through time like this they tell that every parent who be go through the bad time of their life should have the opportunity to receive care in private when speak to the northamptonshire health charity it highlight the importance of hear family voice in this conversation and speak about how dedicate time and experience to the campaign can have healing impact for some of the family who have be involve it be really important that parent consultation be right at the heart of the bill the government be build an nhs fit for the future and big part of that be listen to service user and take on board their feedback believe that this be particularly important in space such as bereavement suite where change that might feel small such as the feel of the space or the access to the room can make huge difference to parent and family in northamptonshire bereaved parent have meet nurse and walk through the maternity ward point out where change can be make to well support parent in future currently in the uk family day lose their baby before during or shortly after birth that be around baby year so this issue be big than kettering or northamptonshire when be research bereavement suite for the bill look on the justgiving website and find it full of appeal from every corner of the country for fund for new facility specialist counselling and train midwife for bereavement service collaboration of charity work to support people affect by the death of baby have develop the national bereavement care pathway to improve the quality and consistency of bereavement care receive by parent after pregnancy loss or the death of baby as of every nhs trust in england have sign up to the national bereavement care pathway but we know there be still work to do not all hospital be currently able to provide properly equipped or suitable bereavement room some be in the middle of the labour ward and some be not sound proof the twinkling stars suite at kettering general hospital be perfect example of how when we welcome contribution from family and parent with experience we spot thing we do not know we need at the moment it be family community and charity who be raise money so that parent can face such difficult time with little more privacy and comfort nobody can take away the pain of lose baby but we can ensure that in that pain family be meet with compassion dignity and privacy and that begin with bereavement suite in every newly build maternity ward question put and agree to order that rosie wrighting jen craft dr marie tidball

committee some of whom be present today for their detailed scrutiny this government have an ambitious plan for change to deliver everything we want to achieve we must spend taxpayer money wisely which be why we commit in our manifesto not to tolerate fraud or waste anywhere in our public service the bill deliver on that commitment it be part of the big crackdown on fraud against the public purse in generation nothing less will do give the appalling position we inherit do the minister recognise that the government own assessment of the effectiveness of the bill be that it will recover tiny of loss the right hon gentleman will be aware that we lose total of billion year to fraud across the public sector the bill will recover billion however it be part of broad measure certainly on the department for work and pensions side of the bill to save billion across the forecast period by the very nature of the change that we be make with the public sector fraud authority we be design they to be scalable as the psfa become more familiar with the work it be undertake we think that it will be able to save significant amount more as be say madam deputy speaker with benefit fraud alone cost billion in this be major problem that be get bad not well we can not afford to ignore it and we certainly do not accept it fraud against the public sector be not victimless crime our public service everyone who depend on they and the taxpayer who fund they all suffer and they be increasingly suffer at the hand of fraudster who use ever more sophisticated technique to steal money mean for the public good the private sector have evolve and adapt its tool and tactic to respond but as the scale of the loss that have just outline make clear the same can not yet be say for the public sector with this bill we will put that right there will be new power for the public sector fraud authority to investigate and deal with public sector fraud outside the tax and social security system and new power for the dwp to modernise its response to fraud and error in the benefit system as my right hon friend the secretary of state say on second reading this bill be tough and it be fair it be tough on the dodgy business people who try to defraud our public service and it be tough on the criminal gang and individual who cheat the benefit system it be fair to claimant who make genuine mistake by help we to spot and prevent error early and it be fair to taxpayer who deserve to know that every single pound of their hard earn money be be spend wisely the human rights act be one of the good piece of legislation ever pass by labour government can the minister assure the house that this bill in no way contravene the secrecy part of the act can give my hon friend that assurance and indeed that all of our legal obligation have be satisfied as part of the consideration of this bill the imperative thing for as minister in the department for work and pensions be that we be support those who need the social security safety net not the fraudster who pick hole in it one concern that we have be the change in the way that people conduct benefit fraud through the use of key buzzword they help people to navigate the system so that they be able to take out of it what be not theirs do he think that there be scope in the bill particularly in some of the new clause to include specific legislation to prevent people from use word and buzzword or from teach other people how to cheat the benefit system the hon gentleman be correct that we have problem with so call sickfluencer but as we will hear in the debate more broadly the government do have exist power through the fraud act and the serious crime act to take action in those area if necessary he be right to suggest that we should be do more and encourage conservative members to reflect on what they do in this space during their period in power he will be reassure to know that have commission work within the department to look at what far we can do but in legislative do believe that we have somebody cross the floor madam deputy speaker just for the record in case hansard do not pick that up that be jennie the dog cross the floor not member of parliament be sure the hon member for torbay steve darling be grateful to you for that clarification madam deputy speaker even if be not as jennie would always be most welcome on this side of the house hope that have reassure the hon gentleman that we do have the legislation require to act the minister say that power exist but plainly they be not work because we know that sickfluencer be do their deed and people be respond to they particularly in the mental health sphere where many of the claim be make indeed we know that official or those act on behalf of official be look out for buzzword because if there be buzzword in there somewhere they can bank the case and move on to the next one therefore something plainly need to be do to stop this will he look again at the opposition new clause and which would ensure that sickfluencer be target specifically and say what in the government amend term they would do to deal with this particular group that be contribute significantly to the failure identify by my right hon friend the member for goole and pocklington david davis in relation to the amount of money that we be able to claim back from the huge sum that be lose to fraud every year very much agree with the right hon gentleman that more need to be do what we differ on be the need for specific legislation in that regard where we be fall down at present be in the scale of the activity we be undertake we could be do significantly more at the moment but as say in response to the previous intervention have commission work to ensure that that happen we already routinely contact social medium company to ask they to take down specific post that could help people to commit fraud against the welfare system be very happy to consider practical point but be convinced that we have the legislative weaponry require to take the necessary action to deal with people who be encourage other to commit fraud both online and elsewhere government amendment and bring into scope the kind of information necessary for fraud investigation and enable the psfa and dwp to compel certain type of special procedure material include banking record or record of employment in line with the policy intent request this type of information be not new for dwp and occur under its exist power the amendment ensure that the psfa and dwp can compel this information to support fraud investigation while also ensure that important exemption be in place such as those for exclude material and journalistic material government amendment and seek to address two separate issue in respect of clause government amendment include provision in the bill so that the power grant to the psfa under the police and criminal evidence act or pace by clause of the bill be exempt from the application of clause this will ensure that the clause do not interfere with exist pace provision in relation to legal professional privilege enable the bill pace measure to function as intend government amendment remove subsection in clause which currently override exist self incrimination protection on the psfa information gather power and pace power this allow the common law principle of the privilege against self incrimination to apply in the usual way under the information gather power and ensure that the propose pace power align with establish pace practice the amendment ensure that clause provide essential safeguard for the psfa power in the bill relate to the processing of information be sure the minister will accept that there be grow concern about issue of automate decision making artificial intelligence and algorithm while want to ensure that we get the good result be the minister able to commit to the transparency we need when it come to ai and algorithm in relation to the bill to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society be not unfairly hit the hon member will be pleased to know that can give he that assurance and that we comply with all the government require standard around the publication of such information government amendment and relate to clause which amend the police reform act to extend the independent office for police conduct director general function to include oversight of public sector fraud investigator enable they to consider psfa use of pace power and associated investigation clause also enable the minister for the cabinet office to issue regulation confer function on the director general in relation to these investigation section of the police reform act set out requirement for such regulation make under that act however section only apply to regulation make by secretary of state as the cabinet office have no secretary of state this section would not include the regulation that the minister for the cabinet office can make under clause government amendment correct that technicality so that section also apply to that minister in addition government amendment simply remove reference to part of the police reform act within clause as the bill will refer to the act more widely rather than just part government amendment and provide clear legislative framework for how the dwp and the psfa will handle and transfer seize evidence to the most appropriate law enforcement agency include the national crime agency and the serious fraud office the amendment will ensure that evidence be handle by the organisation well equip to deal with the specific nature of the alleged crime foster inter agency collaboration and reduce delay to investigation government amendment to and clarify the maximum amount to be deduct from debtor bank by the psfa and the dwp via regular direct deduction order under clause and in schedule respectively the amendment will ensure that the cap be set at percentage of what the person would reasonably be expect to receive each month and they provide flexibility to amend that they will ensure that any deduction be still fair and affordable and do not exceed the maximum percentage set out other factor such as the ability to repay will be consider and mean that in most case the deduction amount will be low than those rate government amendment and will allow the psfa to investigate and pursue enforcement action in respect of the offence in section and of the fraud act those offensive involve possess make and supply article for use in fraud against public authority the amendment will enable the psfa to tackle the wide range of influencer style offence which we discuss early in the same way that the dwp already can which be matter of concern to some bill committee member government new clause and and government amendment and seek to ensure the correct application of the power in part of the bill to devolve benefit in full responsibility for devolved benefit be transfer to the scottish parliament and scottish government however the dwp continue to deliver some benefit to claimant in scotland under agency agreement on behalf of scottish ministers until the scottish government be able to administer those benefit themselves the dwp deliver those benefit in line with how it deliver equivalent benefit in england and wales the intent be that the measure in part of the bill will apply to those devolve benefit that the dwp deliver under agency agreement in line with equivalent benefit in england and wales government new clause and clarify that the secretary of state can exercise the new investigatory power in the bill with devolved benefit only where those be administer by the secretary of state on behalf of scottish ministers they also clarify that scottish ministers exist power under the social security administration act be not change by this part of the bill government new clause and government amendment and ensure that the exist information gathering power contain under section to remain unchanged by the bill for scottish ministers that have result in some reordering and redrafte in clause where the dwp new information gather power under the bill be hold government amendment clarify the position in relation to devolve benefit in clause ensure that the exemption contain in propose new section do not impact scottish ministers power under the act the minister be presumably keen to determine how much money be lose to fraud in scotland and imagine he will require the scottish government to report back to the uk government on their progress in clamp down on benefit fraud but the same should apply in the rest of the country that of course be the purpose of new clause which would require an annual report on the amount of money recover through the process that he have outline will he accept new clause will he also assure on the point about the scottish government reporting of fraud assure the right hon member on his point with regard to the scottish government however will resist new clause because the publication of the dwp annual account will provide sufficient information about our performance on fraud and error government amendment specifie that the function of the independent person who can be appoint by the secretary of state in clause do not apply to devolve benefit unless those be deliver by the secretary of state under agency agreement government amendment and will amend the time require for compliance with production order serve in scotland that be to match normal convention in scotland government amendment ensure that the new debt recovery power take by the secretary of state under the bill apply only to devolve benefit while the secretary of state recover devolve debt under agency agreement government new clause and government amendment be consequential amendment to the social security fraud act and ensure that the power of scottish ministers under the act be unchanged by the bill government amendment and seek to clarify exemption in the dwp information gather power to deliver the intended policy outcome key safeguard in the new dwp information gather power be the exclusion of personal information about user of particular type of free service such as advocacy and advice service that offer crisis support for example when someone be flee domestic abuse the intent of the safeguard be to ensure that nobody be deter from seek the support they need when they need it however the current drafting of that exemption in the bill as not for profit be too broad that exclude certain information that be very likely to be relevant to dwp fraud investigation for example it prevent the department from compelling information from housing association such as an individual address or tenancy which can be instrumental in prove or disprove suspicion of fraud the independent person be require to produce an annual report on the use of the new power which as the minister have just lay out be quite extensive however there be no requirement for the dwp to adopt the report recommendation in case where it do not accept the recommendation will the government consider commit to at least explain why they have reach that conclusion would be very happy to report to the house on the reason why we would not do that be sure the hon lady will allow to write to she separately to set out how intend for we to do that it seem to be reasonable request return to my original point the current drafting would mean that dwp can compel information of that kind from private landlord or estate agent but not from housing association there be an inequity there that we be seek to address with the amendment clarify the drafting and continue to protect the personal information of service user of crisis support or advocacy service the bill also bring forward new information gather power that govern how dwp authorise officer can compel information to support an investigation into fraud it also set out where information must not be compel for example to protect the long stand principle of legal professional privilege separately the bill bring forward power of entry search and seizure for dwp authorise investigator those task with investigate the most serious case of fraud it do that by bring those authorise investigator under the remit of the police and criminal evidence act in england and wales and by create similar power in scotland for dwp authorise investigator that ensure that those investigator be govern by similar legal framework to other law enforcement body that be grant access to use those type of power government amendment seek to ensure that the exemption to information that dwp authorise officer can compel be not applicable to authorised investigator when use power of entry search and seizure government amendment mirror that provision for the psfa those amendment will support effective fraud investigation as without access crucial evidence might remain out of reach slow down our response to fraud those exemption be important but the police and criminal evidence act which apply in england and wales already provide such restriction and safeguard by only enable that information to be compel with the approval of the court couple with similar convention that apply for scotland the amendment ensure that there be no duplication the power in the bill remain in line with exist convention as set out in pace and correctly reflect the norm of the scottish legal system turn to government amendment to paragraph of schedule currently refer to definition within pace in relation to special procedure material confidential professional material exclude material and item subject to legal privilege government amendment and set out specific definition to avoid link provision that relate solely to scotland with exist legislation that apply to england and wales this also ensure that legal privilege and item subject to legal privilege reference contain in the schedule be correctly define for scotland government amendment and be consequential to amendment government amendment and ensure that the power for the dwp under pace take by the bill in schedule be align with those of the police and other government departments such as hmrc and provide clear legal framework for what evidence can be seize and how it should be handle government amendment and mean that dwp authorise investigator such as the police can seize item that be reasonably believe to be evidence of an offence not just dwp relate offence when undertake entry search and seizure activity in england and wales this will mean that potential evidence of any other offence if discover in the course of search can be preserve and may be seize where it be consider necessary to prevent it from be destroy or move the amendment ensure that the law be clear on how it must be handle and transfer to the most appropriate law enforcement agency in england and wales government amendment and make similar provision for authorised investigator in scotland to those have just describe for england and wales government amendment and clarify how authorised investigator can prevent access to seize evidence from any offence if it may prejudice criminal proceeding in scotland by amend the definition of offence in schedule insert by schedule of this act this mirror the same provision that be already in the bill as it apply to england and wales government amendment and be all minor and technical amendment to correct inconsistency in terminology government amendment be minor and technical amendment to provide the correct reference to power in the social security administration act to ensure that the power in scotland align with those in england and wales government amendment amend the period of time in which warrant must be exercise to scotland from three month to one month this correct the bill to ensure that it be consistent with the usual practice in scotland government amendment ensure that the court have the power to order person have be disqualify to provide their ni or eu drive licence as be already the case for those hold gb licence under the new debt recovery power the bill as draft would allow dwp debtor who evade payment and hold an ni or eu licence to be disqualify from drive however it inadvertently limit the court ability to order that person to produce their licence unless it be issue in great britain undermine the power and cause administrative difficulty for the court and the driver and vehicle licensing agency government amendment correct this and ensure parity between gb ni and eu drive licence under the power in schedule government amendment and ensure that the application and limitation period in clause follow the policy intention that the psfa can investigate fraud and recover debt in england and wales government amendment also ensure that the dwp debt recovery power in this bill be not limited in scotland to the usual five year time limit in the prescription and limitation scotland act this make it clear that the long year recovery period in scotland apply to such provision introduce or amend by this bill as have set out the intent behind these amendment be to ensure the delivery of the intended policy intent or to ensure the correct territorial application of the bill thank the minister for give way and hope he will forgive for wait till what appear to be the end of his list when the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery ask he about the application of the human rights act in this context he say that the bill do not breach it in effect my advice be little different and wait to hear about his amendment to see whether anything in they change that my advice be that suspicionless financial surveillance could breach article which cover the right to privacy and article on the prohibition of discrimination will the minister make his legal advice on this available to the house this be incredibly important and it be central to the major criticism of this bill have already make clear that be satisfied with the advice have receive we will make available all the information we be require to make available but the right hon member will appreciate that be not able to give an undertaking to release all legal advice at this stage what can say to he be that be very confident that there be no breach of article in particular that have be explore at length as we have go through the process welcome the ongoing engagement with industry and key stakeholder we have make significant effort to engage all interested party and listen to their view that feedback have be important in shape our approach to the bill to date and will continue to be so as it move to the other place before finish will make some quick remark about the non government amendment on the dwp eligibility verification measure and debt recovery power amendment and from the hon member for torbay steve darling would remove the eligibility verification measure entirely must resist that we have fundamental disagreement about the proportionality of the measure and think his concern continue to be misplace we explore this at length in committee appreciate where he be come from and his perspective but disagree with he when fulfil our duty to protect public money we must also balance individual right to privacy these power will include robust safeguard report mechanism and independent oversight to give confidence that they will be use fairly and effectively the information commissioner himself have welcome the change make to previous iteration of the eligibility verification measure which address many of the concern he have have with the previous government data protection and digital information bill must also highlight the importance of the measure from fiscal perspective it alone will save million over the next five year and million annually once fully roll out similarly amendment from my hon friend the member for poole neil duncan jordan seek to restrict the eligibility verification power for use only when there be suspicion of fraud that would undermine the measure entirely as there be exist information gather power sufficient to deal with such case we require the power because it will enable well datum sharing between the private and public sector to help check that claimant be meet the criterion for their benefit and to detect incorrect payment at an early stage before any suspicion of wrongdoing have arise it be not power to be use to respond to suspect fraud information will not be share with the dwp under the assumption that claimant be guilty of any wrongdoing the dwp must look into why the account have be flag by the bank and ascertain whether an incorrect payment have be make that be why follow receipt of the information from bank the dwp will make further inquiry to determine whether benefit have be incorrectly pay and whether that be due to fraud or error it would be impossible for the dwp to suspect fraud before it have even establish that benefit have be incorrectly pay amendment and from my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker would reduce the effectiveness of the propose debt power within the bill the department can already apply to the court for third party debt order and key reason for introduce the direct deduction order be to recover more public money without unnecessarily use the court time it be also highly unlikely that debtor who have repeatedly refuse to engage with the department and repay voluntarily will suddenly agree to recovery take place directly from their bank account remind the house that obtain information from bank include relevant bank statement under this measure be vital safeguard to establish an affordable deduction rate where someone have refuse to engage it will prevent further issue for debtor than the use of court could bring about for instance county court judgment or court cost and it will enable the department to use regular as well as lump sum deduction order look forward to the debate and to respond to colleague contribution in my closing remark echo the minister comment about the work of the bill committee we have constructive few week get into the nitty gritty have no doubt that the house will agree that fraud be unacceptable whether against individual organisation or the state the money take do not belong to those responsible when it come to defraud the government money be take from every single taxpayer at the same time however error do unfortunately happen they might be make accidentally by the claimant or by the department although there be no ill intention error can still be costly to the taxpayer and that impact some of the most vulnerable people in our country the question then be how good to tackle fraud and error in the welfare state and the public sector although we welcome many of the principle behind the bill much of which build on the work of the conservatives before the general election as be sure will be mention many time this afternoon we be concerned that it have be rush through on one hand there be gap where the legislation be not tough enough it be not strong deterrent to make potential fraudster think again and it do not sufficiently safeguard public money on the other hand part of the bill have not be sufficiently prepare and be incredibly vague and unclear on their implication for those involve and on whether the benefit justify the cost this issue must be consider in the context of sickness benefit bill that be forecast to hit nearly billion by the end of the decade even after the government questionable welfare reform which be vastly more than we spend on defence and more than we spend on school and policing we have table number of amendment to address those point new clause and seek to tackle the rise in so call sickfluencer on social medium such as those on tiktok and youtube who post video show people how they might be able to make fraudulent claim for benefit include the personal independence payment which require not medical evidence but self assessment as we have hear the advice offer include specific buzzword template claim and guidance on pass question at interview stage to inflate the value of claim fraudulently we do not want to target people who provide genuine advice and guidance to people about how the welfare system and public authority work but that be very different from provide assistance and encouragement to commit fraud which be not acceptable we recognise the vital work of not for profit organisation such as citizens advice which work right across the country include in south hams and plymouth in my constituency and group such as improve live plymouth they do much to support those seek to claim what they be entitle to however online sickfluencer must be tackle in committee the minister query our new clause and ask why it provide only for seven year prison sentence when similar offence carry year sentence we have address that in new clause and which as the minister will see propose year sentence to bring they into line with similar offence in their response to my question about sickfluencer the government say that relevant legislation be already in place if that be the case how many conviction have there be under that legislation we could infer from that number whether or not the system be work and what we need to do my suspicion be that we need these measure to be able to hold people to account echo my hon friend concern that the exist power be not be use enough ask the minister to give we further information on how those power be be use and an assurance that they will be use far should our new clause be unsuccessful we believe that create specific offence to target such online fraud would send the clear message to sickfluencer that what they be do be not only morally wrong but illegal something that clear give they no alternative than to realise that they will be catch if the government continue to oppose our amendment because they believe the power already exist to tackle such crime would be grateful if the minister set out at the very least how the government will ensure that that legislation be use to the full particularly with regard to the dwp give that government amendment and refer to the pfsa specifically we be keen to see how those power can be use fully use as the deterrent we need to tackle dwp claim want to know that after today debate and vote sickfluencer will be leave in no doubt that the full weight of the law will be use against they as they actively defraud the state our new clause be on power of arrest we welcome measure in the bill first announce by the previous government to give dwp investigator great power to aid with their investigation such as search and seizure and there must be appropriate safeguard around that this will bring benefit fraud investigation into line with tax fraud investigation in his majesty revenue and customs which be very welcome but we want to go far and address other shortfall in the dwp power new clause would add the power of arrest to the power give to dwp investigator and resolve the seemingly illogical current position the government want to give dwp investigator the power to enter and search premise seize retain and dispose of material obtain sensible material and use reasonable force but not to arrest someone if the evidence show that it be necessary in committee the minister highlight that the police would be able to carry out the arrest function on behalf of the dwp should it ever be necessary but we question whether that be sustainable position and believe that our new clause would ensure we do not place an additional burden on the police this be not without precedent and would bring the dwp into line with the approach take to serious and organised crime across government such as at hmrc and the gangmasters and labour abuse authority our new clause be on liability order because we be concerned about the seizure of asset we want to ensure that the dwp do everything it can to recover fund fraudulently claim even when that money be no long sit in bank account it can not be right that someone can use that money to buy expensive car flat screen tv or other luxury asset which the state can not then recover from they our new clause would give the secretary of state power to apply to the court to seize asset where someone have be find guilty of fraud and the fund have not be recover in order to repay the state in similar vein to our sickfluencer new clause we believe these addition be need to send the strong message to those who be knowingly defraud the system that they will be catch and will have to pay new clause do not just give power to seize asset to the secretary of state it say that she must use they the dwp have say that it can already do this but we know through write parliamentary question that those power have not be use in the last five year albeit the dwp could make use of the proceeds of crime act we believe there must be an explicit expectation that asset will be seize and we need new clause to ensure this be achieve it be great to hear that the hon member party be commit to take tough action against benefit fraud after year of fail in office do she also welcome long sentence for fraud in other area of government such as covid corruption include for those tory donor who commit the crime thank the hon member for his intervention but that be not what we be debate it be certainly not part of my speech our new clause and be on the impact on bank we have concern about the lack of detail in the bill when it come to the eligibility verification mechanism and the requirement that will be put on bank and other financial institution we do not have the statutory code of conduct we do not know what it will cost bank we do not know the result of any pilot scheme and we do not know whether the amount recover will be more than what it cost to administer madam deputy speaker have you be in our committee you would know that the code of conduct be probably the thing most frequently comment on and the ministers do huge amount to reassure we that it be forthcoming and cheesecake and cheesecake as well do not want to say it from the front bench but have now madam deputy speaker you will have to look back at hansard but will never look at cheesecake in the same way the code of conduct be regularly raise in committee and we get assurance continually from the ministers but we still lack that detail we have therefore table number of amendment to get clarity include to require the government to publish their statutory code of conduct information on the testing complete to date and an impact assessment on the cost implication of the bill for bank as well as an amendment to allow bank to challenge the expansion of these power if the cost that would be incur exceed pre agree amount we know that bank and financial institution want to help tackle fraud but measure must be proportionate and not unduly burdensome or they risk divert resource from tackle other type of financial crime to meet these requirement we can not simply assume that the bank and financial institution will do what be right we need to give they an incentive to do it too our amendment and refer to the need for first tier tribunal the bill take significant power for the secretary of state give they the power to review decision that they the cabinet office or the public sector fraud authority make amendment to change the appeal body from the minister for the cabinet office to the first tier tribunal ensure that there be not just independent oversight but an effective independent channel of appeal against information notice that do not just lead back to the organisation that issue the notice new clause be on whistleblowe if we be serious about cut fraud and error we need to have confidence in our whistleblowing procedure for civil service staff experience at first hand at the very beginning of my career what it be like to see public sector fraud be commit and to feel the pressure of want to act while not know what would happen to or my career if do the right thing that be perhaps one of the big regret of my life in december the national audit office publish report investigate whistleblowing in the civil service and set out what further improvement be require the election come before the conservatives be able to act but we hope the new government will take forward new clause to review the whistleblowing process for public sector fraud elsewhere in government new protection have be propose for nhs whistleblower but that should not be the end of the government ambition they must have their own house in order when they come after fraud and error on the part of the general public and would at least like to hear commitment to address the national audit office report turn to new clause throughout all this we must not forget to consider the impact of fraud error and recovery on vulnerable people in the absence of detail be provide to bank about how their eligibility verification mechanism would work we have concern about the potential risk of debanke for vulnerable customer and those in receipt of benefit new clause would require the secretary of state to consider the impact of the bill on vulnerable customer access to banking and would ensure that their access be protect note our support for the principle behind several of the amendment table by the liberal democrats spokesperson the hon member for torbay steve darling include those that consider the impact on financial exclusion and those at risk of domestic abuse overall while the bill come with the right intention of tackle fraud and error indeed eye watering sum have be mention today we have significant concern which our amendment seek to address and we hope that the government will support they however even if this bill pass it will not on its own be enough to bring fraud and error to zero and the government must set out what further action will be take on enforcement the use of artificial intelligence and technology and social medium they must keep push and must make it clear to fraudster that they will not succeed while protect vulnerable people from error if they become complacent and fail to address these issue fear that the bill will not deliver the result that we and not least the hard work taxpayer whose money be be steal all need rise before call the next speaker may make it clear that will come to the liberal democrat spokesperson immediately afterwards welcome the return of this bill to the house be happy to speak on it on second reading when welcome the government crackdown on fraud because every pound lose to fraudulent claim be pound that could be spend on the vital public service on which my constituent in clwyd north rely it be extremely good to see the recognition of the issue and the action take in response to the million of fraud and error payment in in wales alone that figure be up by on the previous year the fine tuning of this bill be important and that fine tuning be do through the government amendment which speak to the correct application under devolution settlement policy intent the application and limitation of part and the consequential amendment propose to parent act be glad to be member of the public bill committee that consider the bill in more detail and throw my weight behind the comment make about how the bill committee progress and how helpful that be to committee member the explanation and expansion by the ministers serve we well and have bring we to where we be today speak on second read about the distinction between intentional fraud and accidental individual error and be pleased that government amendment speak to reservation relate to that and to proportionality crucial safeguard will be strengthen to ensure that no one be push into undue financial hardship because of debt recovery those safeguard include strict affordability check on recovery payment and check on vulnerability take the hon lady point about the need to strengthen safeguard but pass the bill would mean that we would be extend the power of the department for work and pensions before we have the opportunity to look at the independent review of the carer allowance overpayment scandal and see what reform of the department be necessary do she share that concern the bill will protect vulnerability where we see they and it be very much bill of last resort it be aim at people who be not engage with the dwp on fraud and error case now that carer be aware of the problem that have occur in the system we hope that they engage so do not believe that the bill will impact they in the way that the hon gentleman suggest indeed the bill will protect claimant by enable early dialogue which will stop error soon and prevent debt building up through genuine mistake initially have reservation on that point it be clear than ever that the measure be power of last resort for those who have refuse to engage and be able to pay it be important to emphasise that point the measure put dwp power in line with those that already exist for his majesty revenue and customs and the child maintenance service and put the importance of the public money spend by those body on an equal footing the behaviour change that be expect to come as wide benefit of the bill be welcome the bill encourage debtor to negotiate repayment plan ahead of use the measure of last resort importantly as have be say it deter organise fraudster and those look to become involved in fraud by ensure that it be not frame as victimless crime it be anything but because it rob we all of vital money for public service we be not willing to shrug our shoulder at that as the conservative party do at the rise tide of fraud during the covid pandemic and beyond we must all reinforce the narrative that benefit fraud be not victimless crime and our tackle it through the bill be long overdue throughout the passage of the bill in committee and now on report have be reassure that those who have genuine difficulty navigate the social security system have nothing to fear from the bill indeed it will raise awareness of the importance of early dialogue however still have concern about the complexity of the system and how it be administer as voice at second reading but that be for another day as member of the work and pensions committee will continue to focus on that as well as have regular dialogue on the subject with my constituent to conclude welcome the bill and the fine tuning that have come about through government amendment pass in committee be pleased to serve on my first public bill committee and thank the chairs ministers and all involve for its smooth running be happy to support the government amendment put to the house today call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party start by assure the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith that my office have talk out of mention the waitrose cheesecake that be hot topic throughout committee on more serious note would like to explore the challenge in the bill as we have hear fraud can only be bad thing as it rob the public purse but we need to ensure that our approach be proportionate and that be where the rub be for we as liberal democrats first want to focus on the covid crisis we all live through that and some of we be in hot seat be leader of torbay council at the time so it feel as if be in the eye of the storm for some of those challenge be afraid to say that for many of we in this chamber it feel as if the conservatives be asleep at the wheel give the level of fraud that we see take place during the pandemic the fact that billion worth of fraud occur around personal protective equipment be shocking some billion of fraud occur around support for business while it be extremely important that we support business appropriately the safeguard be extremely limited one businessman in torbay say to that it be as if the chancellor of the exchequer have get handful of note fill carrier bag across the town centre and say to the criminal element come and help yourselves the reality be that the money could and should have be put to good use in my constituency torbay hospital be cry out for investment we have sewage scandal and the environment agency could be support in tackle that issue we also have the cost of living crisis we could support people in ensure warm home all that money could help with those thing colleague and good friend have already allude to the carer allowance crisis and the real challenge that it pose more than people the population of the torbay unitary authority area be affect by it there be some million of cost on those people we liberal democrats fear that the power in the bill could make thing even tough for those who have challenge to do with the carer allowance member do not have to take it from that the benefit system be break the secretary of state for work and pensions the chancellor of the exchequer and the prime minister have say that it be if there be such agreement in government that the benefit system be break why be we add to this edifice it be build on foundation of sand yet we be look to pile more responsibility on to it without look for the true positive culture change in the dwp that we need colleague have allude to the area of debate around the bill will touch on few major concern that we liberal democrats have the opportunity that the bill present for orwellian level of mass surveillance of those who get mean test benefit cause grave concern the hon gentleman have get to point on which wholeheartedly agree with he something like million people will fall directly under the reach of this bill if we include their carer landlord and variety of other people it be more than million people would think that the number of fraudster in that number be very small but not vanishingly small so we will put probably more than million people under unnecessary surveillance he be right to call that orwellian concur strongly with the right hon gentleman also of core concern to we be the lowering of the bar for be able to take money out of people bank account and the opportunity to withdraw drive licence from offender however as colleague have say the good practice document be miss that be allude to on number of occasion it be difficult to understand the true nature of this bill if we do not know what that guidance will look like we also have real challenge around henry viii power element of the bill should be write into it but be not so there be real issue there we welcome the independent reviewer of the bill but the secretary of state will be able to appoint their own independent reviewer we do not welcome the secretary of state effectively mark their own homework by make the appointment themselves big brother watch age uk and multitude of other charity have highlight concern about the bill such as the breakdown in trust that it could cause and the risk of amplify the challenge face by people with disability it could also impact on some of the most vulnerable people in our society such as those with learn disability that cause we great concern liberal democrats would like to see real culture change in our manifesto we talk about co design which involve work with people who be benefit claimant and people with disability to make sure that the system be well fit and more fit for purpose as far as we be concerned take more relational approach rather than an adversarial one be the way forward the carer investigation be ongoing it be not set to report until later this summer yet the government be rush ahead with the proposal in the bill suggest to colleague that they do not back these proposal until we hear that investigation finding and see what lesson can be learn rise to speak in support of amendment and which stand in my name would like to start though by place on record my thank to the minister for transformation my hon friend the member for stretford and urmston andrew western include for his willingness to engage in discussion on the term of this bill it have be extremely helpful so want to place that on record also make it clear that my amendment do not in any way seek to undo or frustrate the government legitimate aim of recover public money from fraudster and criminal we absolutely need to do that to ensure that criminal behaviour do not undermine the benefit legitimacy or standing of our welfare system the bill rightly seek to tackle organise crime and online fraud but worryingly it also usher in dangerous new power compelling bank to trawl through financial information be grateful to my hon friend for give way and support his amendment the fact be that million of innocent people whose behaviour have attract no suspicion at all will be subject to intrusion into their bank account be it not odd that there be also access to bank account for the billion of tax unpaid by tax avoider but that power be rarely use in the last year for which have see figure people be suspect of tax avoidance but only have their bank investigate be it not the case that this legislation appear to treat wealthy tax avoider differently from the poor thank my hon friend for his contribution it be the very poor in our society who will be most affect by this legislation bank will be able to trawl through financial information even when there be no suspicion of wrongdoing that be the key point in this debate the very poor include disabled people on pip old people on pension credit carer and those on universal credit will effectively have few right to privacy than everyone else be also deeply concerned about the slippery slope of compelling bank to act as an arm of the state be extremely grateful to the hon member for table his amendment we have the fine legal system in the world and one of its principle be the presumption of innocence as draft the bill undermine that fundamental principle which will raise stress and anxiety and undermine vulnerable people in our society do the hon member agree that that be the current position with the bill yes and be go to address that point shortly it be not the purpose of bank to act as an arm of the state and compel they to do so set very dangerous precedent that we in this house need to be aware of we also know that organise crime group which be responsible for more than billion of large scale fraud will evade detection by spread fund across multiple account beyond the reach of the algorithmic scanning that will be use to flag overpayment it will be welfare recipient who be catch up in the net of bank surveillance regardless of whether they be suspect of fraudulent activity congratulate my hon friend on his eminently reasonable and common sense approach to this debate and on amendment do it seem to he as it seem to that this legislation take place in wide context along with the propose tightening of eligibility for personal independence payment it move we towards hostile environment for benefit claimant particularly disabled benefit claimant we will end up treat they as suspect automatically do he agree that it be right for we to oppose this measure when the conservatives want to do it table an early day motion sign by nearly mp to that effect we have to oppose this measure now the good way to resolve it be by the government accept his eminently reasonable order that be very long intervention perhaps we would be well off go back to neil duncan jordan thank my hon friend for his intervention will cover the connection between this piece of legislation and the green paper shortly will the outcome for the individual disabled people my hon friend be concern about the vast majority of whom commit no fraud be any different if these measure be implement they will not be affect because they be not commit any crime as have try to explain the bill introduce fundamental change to the nature of our welfare system and its use be signatory to amendment in answer to the point that have just be make to the hon gentleman if the bank use algorithm they will have an error rate of at least that mean or more innocent people will be drag through the system by this proposal the right hon member bring to my next point which be the risk of horizon style scandal on massive scale give the sheer volume of account that will be scan that be glaringly obvious these new power also strip those who receive state support of that fundamental principle of british law the presumption of innocence as the hon member for birmingham perry barr ayoub khan say early amendment would ensure that the government can tackle fraudster but would limit the use of an eligibility verification notice to case where welfare recipient be suspect of wrongdoing and not merely of error that proportionate and necessary safeguard would prevent the corruption of our welfare system which will turn it from safety net mean to offer dignity and support to those in need into punitive system where accessing help come at the cost of someone privacy and civil liberty the bill grant the department draconian power to apply to court to have people strip of their drive licence if they have an outstanding debt whether for overpayment fraud or error amendment and would remove that power from the bill there be fair and more effective way to enforce the law analysis of the bill have show that where assessment deem that financial deduction would cause hardship the debtor can face lose their licence that be not justice in my view but penalty for be poor have hear the claim that this measure will be last resort when the debtor have fail to engage over period but that overlook the fact that non engagement can be symptom of hardship rather than wrongdoing many welfare recipient include those with mental health condition and caring responsibility find it difficult to navigate the complex bureaucracy of our social security system and may be unfairly deem not to have engage with the dwp it be important and necessary to have well legislation to look after people doubt that anyone in the chamber have not be confront by constituent who have make an inadvertent mistake give the complexity of the paperwork and the ream of question it be beyond the ability of most people to respond do the hon gentleman share my concern and that of many other that if the system continue to be so complicated it will inadvertently drive people into position for which they be not responsible agree think that the complexity of our system lend itself to error on the part of individual who find it extremely difficult to navigate in committee several witness explain that people avoid repayment for variety of reason include not know where to get help simply be overwhelm by the whole process or face multiple debt hope that the minister will provide further reassurance on that specific point relate to amendment and all these challenge will only be make bad if the government proceed with the plan cut in disability benefit outline in the recent green paper which will affect more than million family the last government strip our welfare state to the bone during year of deep cut disabled people be already far more likely to be in destitution and to rely on food bank but spy on million of people or pile cut on to fail system will not repair our welfare model the government must pause for thought meet representative of disability organisation and build fair system with their consent and confidence our welfare state need to provide support for those who need it and the change that we promise as government must lead to more compassionate and caring society one that enable rather than penalise these be the value that make we different from the last government and we should not forget that rise order it would be helpful if member try to confine their speech to five minute or so but do not propose to introduce formal time limit yet wish to speak in support of new clause entitle publication of result of pilot scheme make no mistake this bill allow for massive expansion of state power it will permit mass financial surveillance of the public it be massive overreach by the state so of course it require close scrutiny it require the publication of those result and then they must be analyse let put this in context before the covid year fraud and error across the tax and benefit system be at an all time low then in after state impose lockdown another massive state intervention unprecedented financial support be set up for million of people in rush of panic with the full support of member on both side of the house exclude myself from that but very few member oppose the arrangement and it open up all sort of new vulnerability in the system this support be set up only because of blanket stay at home mandate from the state it be the state that open up those fraud vulnerability and it be the state that see as result of those imposition many million more people claim universal credit let give the house the figure in march million people be receive universal credit by november that year million be receive it and in january the number be million just as the heavy handed state intervention of lockdown leave the public pay very high price be concerned that the bill another heavy handed state intervention will also leave the public pay very high price as big brother watch state the bill will introduce an unprecedented system of mass financial surveillance create second tier justice system for people on the poverty line undermine the presumption of innocence result in serious mistake risk the freedom and fund of our country elderly disabled and poor and turn britain once fair welfare system into digital surveillance system have say it before and will say it again lockdown be an experiment inflict on the british people without their consent and that experiment fail the bill will be another such experiment on the british public we should not be surprised that we see such an increase in the amount of money lose to fraud in the system the truth be that when there be knee jerk reaction to moment of crisis there will be serious repercussion when the state take extra power and the power of the state go unchecked many inequity flow the bill be another example of that there seem to be an unwillingness to talk about it there be collective denial about the reality of what lockdown do to our country and the dire consequence we be all suffer we need to admit our mistake and learn from they that be the only way we will not repeat such mistake of mass state intervention again that state intervention one size fit all approach exacerbate by haste and rapid deployment lack the detail of planning it lack try and test vehicle of delivery and it lack safeguard the massive intervention propose by the bill at the very least need further testing and piloting and most importantly the publication of the result and an analysis of they be sorry to have to say it madam deputy speaker but have no faith that the government have do the homework require to implement the scheme and not without good reason this be government who do not have good track record on do impact assessment or on do their homework before major legislation be introduce such as the removal of the winter fuel payment from pensioner and the fallout from that the impact of vat on school the devastation to the farming community and to food security cause by the taxis on farm and the impact on business and employment of the increase in employer national insurance contribution we be see the failure of not do test impact assessment and thoroughly work out how thing will work much more detailed work need to go into change of this enormity this extraordinary power be ineffective and entirely disproportionate to the revenue the government expect to raise via its use the government own estimate be that it will get back less than of the estimate annual loss to fraud and error talk about hammer to crack nut this be power for power sake an absolutely unnecessary power grab from the people today see the threat unchecked untested and come forward loom on the horizon be other form of state intervention and global intervention with the world health organisation new international health regulation now be the time for member to have conversation about massive state intervention and why we do not want they in conclusion it be ironic be it not that massive state overreach and the draconian legislation use for lockdown lead to high level of fraud error and million more people on benefit it will supposedly now be solve and correct by yet another massive state overreach and draconian legislation it be wrong then and it be wrong now sometimes in these debate we be try to influence those on the front bench to be honest on this legislation have give up on that just want to get on the record for my constituent why be concerned about this piece of legislation and why support amendment we have all preface our speech by say that we all want to tackle fraud to follow on from the speech by the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey in that process during covid think be the first mp to raise the issue of the massive fraud that be go on with bank loan when write to the then chancellor and to various ministers receive response that have almost be dictate by the bank say that all the security measure have be put in place and that it be be administer effectively we then discover that it be think billion although we recover an element of that so be very wary about ensure that public expenditure avoid the level of fraud that we see during that time be concern about this bill which take huge step constitutionally legally and on civil liberty other have make similar point our tradition be that someone be innocent until prove guilty that have be the legal principle from magna carta onwards the investigation power be usually trigger by some element of suspicion this legislation rid roughshod over that long year tradition on privacy whatever assurance we be give about the bill compliance with human right legislation have my doubt it introduce for the first time that have see in this country on an issue like this mass surveillance the right hon gentleman go right to the point try to make with the minister there be ngos support amendment it be almost certain that if we go down this route it will end up in court think the government will lose on article on the question of individual privacy follow the right hon gentleman track record on issue like this he have be prove right on virtually every occasion agree in addition to the mass surveillance the extent of the information that can be seek and interpret from the bill be extremely wide range and open to challenge what have annoy be that we be now introduce legislation in advance of what we be promise by way of code of conduct and operation we have no idea how this will work out in practice without those code member may recall that the code set out detail on how the system would operate at every level with the information seek investigatory power and so on we do not have those but we be be tell not to worry because the other place will receive they well that be not our responsibility as mps our responsibility be to deal with the matter here we also do not know how the independent person as they be describe in the legislation be to be appoint or how they be go to operate the hon member for brighton pavilion siân berry raise the question of how their report and recommendation will then be implement there be also the question of whom they will be accountable to and whether there be any accountability for those independent person to this house time and again when we have introduce legislation like this in the past that have short circuit the traditional protective constitutional and legal mechanism it have lead to debacle and miscarriage warn ministers that that be exactly what we be face here reference have be make to issue with regard to the use of computer model and algorithm we seem to have learn nothing from where we have make those error as also raise on second reading what be happen here be discriminatory we be choose class of people largely work class people who be claim benefit and we be target they if there be class of people we should be target who have record of fraud and of claim thing that they should not well here we be as the expense scandal demonstrate if there be one group of people we should be examine more closely it be member of parliament want to talk very briefly about the impact of these measure from constituency point of view as an mp for year and councillor for over year in total have meet lot of people who do not claim benefit to which they be entitle they be often old people but there be other as well why do they not claim in my experience it be because of the stigma attach to claim benefit with this bill we be add bit more stigma which will act as disincentive to those who genuinely qualify for benefit and should be come forward it be that terror of make an error that fear of risk be penalise for claim benefit they may not be entitle to or of be pay too much there be real fear among my constituent about such miscarriage most of the constituent who come to our constituency surgery have try everything else by the time they get to we they be the one with the most chaotic life and they be the one who get sanction time and again not because of any deliberate act but often because they have mental health issue or because something in their life prevent they from attend that interview or from apply for enough job in time what will happen to they they will be drag into this system again at the moment they come to we this be largely the case in my constituency because most of the advice agency have be close down thank to the cut that have take place and they come to we in desperation this bill will make people even more desperate it will deter people who qualify for benefit from claim and it will cause real hardship and impose severe penalty on those who least deserve it that be why think this be poor piece of legislation and it will not be long before we be back here again to amend it to restore some element of civil liberty and protection for the poor in our society shall impose with immediate effect four minute time limit when it come to public money everyone accept the importance of prevent fraud there be no dispute about that the mere think that our benefit system could be exploit loosen the cement hold our welfare system together however if we look back in history there have be track record of fraud recovery measure not deliver what be hop this measure will also probably never save the billion that be expect of it so ask will the allege reward of this legislation ever match the scale of the imposition on our civil liberty and be we really go after the right target we all want to catch deliberate and professional fraudster but they be precisely the people who be astute enough to change tactic set up separate bank account and avoid suspicion instead it will be the innocent and the accidental claimant who fall into the trap the implicit assumption be that we should trust in the dwp as completely error free organisation across the entirety of its massive operation but the dwp do make mistake it make mistake all the time and even when it know that it have make mistake and it have be tell so it be very capable of make the same mistake all over again in my constituency of horsham anthony and his husband be accuse of provide misinformation to the dwp and be overpay as result anthony protest without success after long fight the case go to appeal the tribunal waste no time decide in his favour it be an open and shut case but then early this year anthony and his husband be migrate over to universal credit after confirm all detail be correct the dwp overpay they again and then seek to claw the money back over the following month the dwp mistake but anthony pay the penalty the dwp have its rule but real life do not run in straight line real life be messy how can we possibly rely on the dwp to mark its own homework when we know that there be just four fraud adviser per regional office to handle case flag by frontline staff yes there be some check and balance within this legislation but what be really need be profound cultural change within the dwp and that be much hard to achieve the common experience of people who have to deal with the dwp on daily basis be that they feel that it be always look to catch they out year and year of inflammatory rhetoric under succession of conservative government have convince people to regard the dwp as their enemy not their friend if anything the bill dig that hole little deep what concern most about the bill be its extreme overconfidence it assume that government agency always get thing right and that individual citizen be to be automatically treat as object of suspicion in committee the government be resistant to any amendment except their own so very much hope that they will reconsider today and accept the liberal democrat amendment rise to speak against amendment and and new clause and fraud in the benefit system affect we all it cost we as country almost million an hour it take money from the most vulnerable in society and undermine the legitimacy of and public support for our social security system however many of the amendment propose simply do not recognise the vital need for this legislation some such as amendment and would hamstring the bill by prevent we gather key information other such as amendment and would limit the effectiveness of the bill and make its power more difficult to use other such as amendment and new clause and would seek to delay its effect these amendment however differently propose all suffer from the same pathology they fail to take fraud seriously we have hear number of speech today from opponent of the bill but we be yet to hear from they any serious practical suggestion about how we might tackle fraud these opponent say that they be concerned to protect the vulnerable but say gently that they can offer no proposal on how to prevent the fraud that be steal from the needy in our society many member be come from genuine place of concern about how to strike the right balance between protect the public purse on the one hand and the privacy and right of claimant on the other think the bill get the balance right the power it provide be proportionate will the hon member give way have limit time so will make progress the power the bill provide be proportionate measure and ring with safeguard it be mark of this that as we hear from the secretary of state on second reading the information commissioner have state that the bill as currently draft have address their previously state concern as well as be proportionate the power be necessary to fight the ever more sophisticated fraud that we be face over the past decade financial institution have extensively overhaul their use of technology and datum and their approach to the evolving fraud threat yet the government have not it be illuminate but perhaps not surprising that while social security fraud have rise dramatically post covid fraud volume and loss in the financial service sector include credit card fraud have fall accord to uk finance the public sector have pay steep price for not modernise its anti fraud approach and fail to adopt industry good practice it be gap that this bill seek to address most of all the measure in the bill be crucial for protect the vulnerable and safeguard the legitimacy of the system itself our social security system rest on public consent and belief that money be fairly spend fraud and error chip away at this social contract and it take money from those who need it most the public in hendon and across the country expect we to take action there be nothing progressive whatsoever about permit fraud the only people who benefit be the criminal who exploit our system and those who wish to undermine its role as cornerstone of civilised and fair society for the sake of the most vulnerable the taxpayer fairness and the system itself hope the house will join in support the bill and vote down those amendment there continue to be many problem with the bill but recognise that the minister and his team have have extensive conversation with the scottish government and make number of amendment as result welcome the communication between the two government and urge the minister to ensure that the dwp team have extensive conversation in advance of the come welfare bill so that it will not need so many government amendment on report for how it interact with scottish legislation and scottish system turn to new clause on carer allowance it would be completely fair to wait until review have be do there need to be significant look into that as claw back money from people without see the result of that review would be incredibly problematic be therefore happy to support the new clause on sickfluencer be concerned that although the shadow minister have try to draft new clause to exclude people give advice it might unintentionally catch some of those people on that basis be not keen to support it as would be worried about people who offer genuine advice be catch up in that however understand that she attempt to draft it carefully to try to avoid that would be more than happy to support amendment the snp will support it on the suspicion of wrongdoing be think in particular about the speech make by the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell be not go to mention the propensity of former mp to claim thing fraudulently but in look at who actually cost the taxpayer significant amount of money if the government be to say we know that people who hold million of pound in offshore trust fund often dodge tax so we be go to survey all their bank account imagine that there would be some sort of uprising particularly from some wealthy people we be aware of but because the government be say it cool it just poor people who will be impact we be all expect to assume that this surveillance be fine it be not fine it be an absolute imposition on people life as many have say it be treat everybody as though they be fraudster let we look at the amount of money set to be save the government will save less money annually than the dwp make in overpayment rather than impose on so many people civil liberty surely crack down on dwp official error overpayment which would save more money would be well place to begin it be absolutely daft completely agree with new clause table by my colleague the hon member for brighton pavilion siân berry particularly in relation to the reasonable expectation that people could understand that they have be overpay constituent contact recently because they have letter tell they that they be to be migrate to universal credit they be terrified that they will be deport because the word migrate be use in that letter they do not understand the language use by the dwp give that universal credit be so complicated to calculate so many people could not reasonably have be expect to understand that they be be overpay the dwp should take that into account before look at mass surveillance the bill address the serious issue of fraud and error in our public service welcome the government continuation of the work of the previous government to protect taxpayer money and uphold the integrity of our welfare system the amendment propose by the official opposition would not undermine the bill they would enhance it our amendment would preserve the fundamental principle of fairness and proportionality while strengthen the tool at our disposal to tackle wrongdoing in that spirit rise to speak in support of new clause and new clause be measured and necessary proposal that would simply bring the department for work and pensions in line with other government body such as hmrc and the child maintenance service which already have the power to issue arrest warrant for case of serious fraud against the state why should it lack those enforcement capability when the crime that it deal with be just as serious the taxpayer enter into social contract with the state contract base on trust responsibility and accountability my constituent pay their taxis and quite rightly expect that those who cheat lie or exploit the system will face the consequence we in this house be the guardian of that social contract if the public believe that we be turn blind eye to fraud or fail to act decisively that trust begin to erode and the social contract will be put at risk illegal action must have legal consequence in support new clause the government could send clear and unequivocal message fraud and deceit have no place in our society turn to new clause it have recently be highlight that individual be use social medium to promote way of defraud the system include through the motability scheme that be deeply troubling although ministers have previously respond positively to my question on that the current version of the bill do not go far enough unless the government support our amendment they will fail to take the concrete step need to address that evolve form of deceit this house have an opportunity today to work across party line to far strengthen the bill and reaffirm our commitment to protect the social contract between the government and those govern let we act with unity and resolve to reduce fraud restore public trust and ensure that our system work for those who truly need they and not for those who seek to abuse they under the previous conservative government fraudster get away with claim billion of pound of covid support fund as an eyewatering billion go uncollected due to tax evasion and other criminal activity while vulnerable member of our society have see their benefit cut and our public service be in need of investment it be not right that public spending have be misplace into the pocket of fraudster be therefore grateful for many of the measure in the bill that will work to reduce instance of fraud however have concern about some of the broad measure regard the power the legislation would give the department for work and pensions and the potentially intrusive impact that could have on the civil liberty of citizen speak in support of new clause table by my hon friend the member for torbay steve darling which would require report to parliament within six month on the cause and cost of public sector fraud during the pandemic the report would include an account of any fraudulent payment and review of procurement practice during covid include contracting for supplier and the role of political appointment and personal connection in procurement decision as well as an assessment of the adequacy of government oversight to prevent fraud against public authority much of that work have already be undertake by the public accounts committee be member as be in the previous parliament and it would be worthwhile for the minister to take look at some of our reporting on those topic if failing be find the new clause would require an outline of corrective action include statement to this house to acknowledge the finding and to set out action plan to ensure that any failing be not repeat with public trust in politic at alarmingly low level we must take all possible step to ensure integrity and the high possible standard in governance the cronyism rule breaking and sleaze scandal of the last conservative government do huge damage to public trust in politic and politician in this country the new clause would lead to an increase of accountability and urge the minister to accept it even though be glad to see the government introduce measure that would crack down on instance of fraud have grave concern about some of the broad measure in this legislation that would lead to an unacceptable increase in intrusion on individual privacy that be why speak in favour of amendment which would revoke clause and remove the requirement for bank to look into relevant claimant bank account some measure in the bill raise significant concern regard the privacy of individual and have hear from constituent who be alarmed at some of the power that could be introduce with this legislation believe that fraud must be root out and that more should be do to prevent fraud from happen in the first place however clause be an unnecessary and invasive step that urge the government to refrain from take have hear from people who be concerned about the power grant in the bill because it enable the government to have direct access to individual bank account and even enable the dwp to withdraw fund or revoke driving licence that concern be particularly serious when it come to vulnerable group such as the elderly disabled people and those live in poverty who could face devastating consequence as result of wrongful penalty welcome the government commitment to crack down on fraud there be clear failure by the previous conservative government during the covid pandemic which we see highlight in the ppe procurement scandal and the bypassing of the usual procurement rule via the vip lane it be essential that proper rule be in place to ensure that public spending be carry out in an effective efficient and transparent way and be glad to support new clause which would strengthen transparency and accountability on this issue however grave concern about the intrusive power that this legislation could introduce have be express across the house today particularly those that allow the government to require bank and other financial institution to share client datum and as such urge the minister to accept amendment to revoke clause there be lot could say but will mainly just commend to members my new clause which would remove official error from the most punitive measure in the second part of the bill speak against the whole suite of intrusive legislation in the second part of the bill on second reading and green mps still oppose it now be pleased to serve on the public bill committee and will be support number of other amendment that also back there alongside the hon member from both side of the house who propose they on second reading and in committee describe how the bill treat already stigmatise benefit claimant as suspect not citizen through blanket intrusion and surveillance it be absolutely wrong that this legislation should go through in this form think the first part work but the second part be absolutely out of order new clause table in my name be about fair play it would bring test for the recovery of universal credit overpayment cause by official error into line with regulation of the housing benefit regulations so that they could be recover only where the claimant could have reasonably be expect to realise that there be an overpayment let we be in no doubt mistake by the dwp can have huge financial and psychological impact on people who be receive benefit and the risk of harm be particularly acute with official error overpayment which individual have no way of anticipating point out that new clause be equivalent to an amendment propose by labour front benchers during the passage of the welfare reform act back in when the government first start to recover universal credit overpayment turn to few of the other important amendment before the house today restate my support for amendment and in the name of the hon member for torbay steve darling these seek simply to remove the totally indefensible bank spy power express my support for amendment and in the name of the hon member for poole neil duncan jordan which rightly seek to do away with the drive disqualification power which have previously oppose also put on record my support for amendment also in the name of the hon member for poole which rightly limit the bank spy power to case with exist suspicion of wrongdoing be pleased that the hon member for liverpool wavertree paula barker have take forward amendment and which table in committee my green party colleague and will also be vote for new clause in the name of the hon member for torbay on carer allowance and lesson learn it matter when we treat people who need safety net as suspect it matter when government invade privacy with blanket intrusion that affect old people disabled people and other minority in disproportionate way and it matter that the power propose today extend to impoverish citizen and punish they for our own department mistake treat people with humanity and due process should be the default setting not these intrusive new blanket law and hope that parliament will ask ministers to dial up the competence dial down the stigma and think again over the past few month it have be one thing after another for the vulnerable the sick and disabled people the recently announce cut to welfare will affect of the population in wales accord to policy in practice punish the sick and disabled this bill add to that punishment by increase state financial surveillance of welfare recipient it be full of intrusive measure from grant access to three month of bank statement to allow direct deduction from bank account without court order and provide police with power under the police and criminal evidence act to enter and search property that be not just my opinion numerous charity and organisation from age uk to the child poverty action group support big brother watch recommendation to oppose eligibility verification power under clause for example similar power be propose by the previous conservative government and consider potential breach of privacy under the human rights act labour mp at that time be among critic of those power it be disappointing to see so few labour mp here today but thank those who have once again speak up be glad to see amendment include amendment and table by the hon member for liverpool wavertree paula barker and amendment table by the hon member for poole neil duncan jordan that seek to address such concern include by limit or remove power to compel bank to provide sensitive financial information even the thought of this provision be cause real anxiety and distress such as for my constituent simon mead and his family mr mead daughter who receive pip due to the long term effect of brain cancer as child and his son who suffer from psychosis and schizophrenia be extremely worried about the government access their private financial decision it be already affect their day to day life and decision when write to the government outline mr mead concern before the bill be publish be tell that the bill be not design to cause distress or to undertake covert surveillance of disabled people or any benefit claimant well that be obviously not the case be it combine with restrict winter fuel payment the refusal to abolish the two child cap and the sweeping welfare cut many vulnerable and disabled people genuinely feel that they be be disproportionately target this be reality that the labour government must accept and address the bill far stigmatise people who we be suppose to protect those who be entitle to state support who be already suffer follow recent uk government decision as members of parliament it be our job to well people life and ensure that everyone in our community feel support we be here to serve and to serve all our constituent which include the vulnerable the elderly the disabled and the infirm we be not here to cause further distress and hardship we need to ensure that constituent have access to the help and service they need sadly this bill do the opposite that be the end of the back bench contribution we come to the front benches and first the shadow minister with the leave of the house will make few additional comment this be the perfect opportunity to respond to some of the point make about conservative amendment and new clause the hon member for hendon david pinto duschinsky be on short time limit and be not able to take any intervention but want to speak to the point he make on include our new clause for example new clause he rattle off the other amendment number quickly so hope he will forgive if do not hear they all but believe that new clause and be include his implication be that the new clause we table would delay the bill be put into law that would not be the case because each of they be word for after the act come into force the new clause would be additional safeguard on the cost implication for bank annual reporting and the publication of an antifraud and error technology strategy that would make the bill even well rather than essentially be wreck amendment regardless of the other amendment include in the hon member list our be certainly not in that vein the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman say that she be slightly unhappy about new clause because those who genuinely help benefit claimant get what they be entitle to may inadvertently be catch by it that be not our intention we want only those who push people towards commit fraud to be catch citizens advice and improve live plymouth for example which help people claim what they be entitle to would not be catch by the new clause because they would be involve in error only if mistake be make rather than through fraud appreciate what she say but that be not our intention the wording of our new clause cover that concern be raise in committee about the extent of bank account search in our view other bank account use by those who commit fraud would not be check under the bill so we probably need to go far to ensure that fraud be properly tackle to be more light hearted for moment if may anybody read the report of the debate will see plenty of reference to cheesecake and think should explain why concern be raise in committee about the fact that under the bill an account individual transaction could be assess and judge so everybody would feel terrible if they buy cheesecake from waitrose other shop be available and that would be problem in future if anybody be wonder why we be talk about cheesecake it relate to concern about transaction be check at the time the minister kindly reassure we that the bill would not provide for individual transaction to be check it would deal just with benefit payment and whether someone have capital that they should not have while claim benefit hope that that be helpful with the leave of the house thank all hon member for their contribution in the time have will try to respond to some of the point raise have listen closely to the concern set out by member from across the house and will of course ensure that they be take forward as the bill progress to the other place but today will resist all non government amendment will make initial comment in response to several member before turn specifically to the nature of the amendment and new clause the opposition spokesperson the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith and the hon member for mid leicestershire mr bedford say that the bill build on the previous administration work to tackle fraud and error have to say think that be fairly generous interpretation of that work not least because as far as can see the previous government introduce absolutely no power for the public sector fraud authority to tackle fraud across the public sector and moreover nothing on debt recovery the only evidence we can find of any new power the previous government seek to introduce be in the eligibility verification space accept that they seek to do that but they do so in rather botched fashion which be subject to significant criticism and with none of the safeguard and oversight in place we have now build those into the bill absolutely agree with the opposition spokesperson that the government can not be complacent in tackle fraud and we will not be but say gently that have allow fraud and error in the welfare system to spiral to billion at the time of the last election the same can not be say of the previous government the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for torbay steve darling speak of broken welfare system do not want to be draw into debate on that but broken approach to tackle benefit fraud and error be certainly part of any problem that the department face want to address the point that my hon friend the member for poole neil duncan jordan make about the eligibility verification measure in relation to his amendment the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman and my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell speak of the impact this would have on the poor give they less right to privacy than everybody else understand their concern but that be not my interpretation because we have already establish in this place the right of government to receive information or datum from private organisation include bank and building society that point to financial standing hmrc already receive datum on every interest bear account in the country so this be not an unprecedented power hmrc send out notice to datum holder cover million account and notice to card acquire service provider it receive million line of datum on card sale understand members concern but challenge gently the extent to which the measure be unprecedented my hon friend the member for poole and my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington allude to the risk of horizon type event want to assure the house of very clear difference the horizon scandal emerge because evidence be take from single source that will not be the case here we will receive flagged information from bank of potential breach of eligibility criterion however that will not be sufficient source of evidence to prove fraud that will trigger look at the account and if there be not an obvious reason why somebody be potentially in breach of eligibility criterion human investigation will be trigger that look at range of source of evidence to establish the reason only then would there be any suggestion that fraud or error have occur there can be legitimate reason for somebody have an amount of capital above that allow by their benefit for instance if somebody on universal credit receive payment of more than which be the maximum amount of capital allow as result of the horizon scandal or the infected blood scandal they would be exempt understand the concern but think this be distinct from the horizon scandal can the minister reassure we that no action will be take to stop social security payment until the human investigation have happen be happy to provide that assurance the hon member have steal my next line can say categorically that this be data push only no decision will be take as direct result other than decision to look far into an account and potentially initiate human investigation if need want to say little more about amendment and table by my hon friend the member for poole which relate to drive licence he rightly say that welfare recipient may not be able to engage with the department for the record nobody in receipt of benefit or pay through pay as you earn employment will be in scope of the debt recovery power and therefore of the power to suspend driving licence where we do seek to suspend someone drive licence it be worth remember that this be after we have make at least four attempt to contact they through our debt management team and at least four further attempt through our debt enforcement team and we have establish their ability to repay by look at three month bank statement if when we seek to deduct from that bank account an individual have remove the fund that we know they have it be only then that we would look into the possibility of suspend their drive licence even then because this be very much last resort power we would seek to agree repayment plan with they right up until the end the court would set repayment term if drive licence be suspend it be also worth say that it be always suspend decision subject to compliance with an affordable repayment plan set by the court as say this be power of last resort hope colleague be reassure to hear of the many step before we reach that point and most importantly of all to hear that the power do not apply to current benefit recipient or anybody pay through paye employment the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey mention new clause and the publication of pilot scheme result would like to clarify for the house that we be not propose any further pilot scheme as result of introduce this legislation two pilot scheme have already take place so we know that our proposal work we will be adopt test and learn approach so that we can scale thing up the question of whether this mechanism will yield information that be helpful to we in our inquiry be settle by the previous government have all the detail and all the information from the only pilot scheme that the government be prepared to run be publish in their entirety information of that nature be publish prior to second reading and be available to members turn to the amendment and new clause that attract the most attention in today debate new clause table by the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for torbay pertain to the carer allowance pay tribute to the million of unpaid carer across the country this government value carer highly and recognise the vital and valuable contribution they make every day like other see that in my constituency work week after week and be in awe of all that carer do this government inherit system in which busy carer already struggle under huge weight of responsibility have be leave to repay large sum of overpaid carer allowance sometimes worth thousand of pound we need to understand exactly what go wrong so that we can set out our plan to put this right that be why we launch an independent review of earning relate overpayment and we be delighted that liz sayce agree to lead that review which will investigate how overpayment of carer allowance have occur what can well be do to support those who have accrue they and how to reduce the risk of these problem occur in future the independent review be under way and be anticipate to conclude this summer but we be not sit back we be take action now we continue to review and improve our communication with carer to make it as easy as possible for they to tell we when something have change in their life that could affect their carer allowance entitlement moreover this government introduce the large ever increase in the earning limit since carer allowance be introduce the weekly carer allowance earning limit increase to from april this year it be now peg permanently to hour clearly many carer have be affect by overpayment overpayment come as shock to many who be try to work in order to bridge the gap between carer allowance and their family cost and it have significant impact on their mental health do the minister share my gratitude to liz sayce for the work that she be do to hopefully provide clarity for the many carer who be try to juggle unpaid family care and work absolutely agree liz sayce be do excellent work and look forward to see the conclusion of her review in due course turn to new clause as have say the independent review that have be commission be expect to arrive at its conclusion this summer it would be irresponsible for to commit in advance to implement all recommendation as the house will understand the recommendation will need to be give careful consideration when they be provide to the department moreover do not believe that the new clause would have the effect intend will the minister give way if the hon gentleman do not mind will not as be short of time new clause would prevent recovery of carer allowance overpayment via the new recovery power in this bill but the dwp would still be able to recover carer allowance overpayment through deduction from benefit or through deduction from paye earning this would place carer in an unequal position in regard to overpayment recovery with recovery depend on whether they be in receipt of benefit or in paye employment even if believe that that be what the amendment intend suspend recovery of all carer allowance overpayment until the independent review have conclude would be disproport ionate there be safeguard and protection for those with overpayment include appeal right affordable repayment plan and in exceptional circumstance the option to waive the debt turn to new clause which the opposition spokesperson the hon member for south west devon speak to and will refer to new clause which propose to introduce new offence of fraud against public authority in my view that be already cover by exist offence make the amendment duplicative and unnecessary fraud be already an offence under the fraud act and the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud regardless of whether the fraud be against public authority or anyone else be already in existence the government amendment to clause bring together the offence in section and of the fraud act of possess make or supply article for use in fraud with the offence of assist and encouraging that be find in section to of the serious crime act that allow we to tackle the issue that committee member be concern about influencer style offence in which person provide the knowledge need to commit fraudulent act through internet video or manual on that point will the minister give way will not take an intervention from the hon gentleman on this subject early but be short of time interruption have he stay for the whole debate might have be more willing to do so but respond to his early invention in my view we simply need to enforce exist law similarly new clause seek to amend the social security administration act to introduce an offence of encourage or assist fraud again in my view this be unnecessary because that be cover by the fraud act and the serious crime act the hon member for south west devon ask for assurance that we would use the power that we already have as say in response to intervention have commission work in the department to look at how we can far use the power that we have in my view historically we have not take good advantage of they on that point will the minister give way be sorry but will not turn to new clause we want to ensure that the government have access to wide appropriate and proportionate range of debt recovery power so that we have multiple method of recover money from those who have the mean to pay but refuse to do so however new clause be not require as equivalent action be already provide for through exist legislation for the dwp and by clause of this bill for the psfa clause clarifie that the psfa be able to seek alternative civil recovery through the civil court in addition there be direct deduction order and deduction from earning order in the bill which could include liability order have largely cover amendment in closing want to make few observation about amendment and table by my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker but speak to by other member in my view those amendment would reduce the effectiveness of our debt recovery power as propose in the bill so can not agree to they recognise the importance of dialogue with customer all the way through the journey of debt recovery as set out in response to the concern about the revocation of drive licence raise by my hon friend the member for poole we will seek to engage with people at all stage of the journey if we identify any vulnerability we would cease recovery and at all stage we would look to agree an affordable repayment plan hope that have address the majority of the point raise by right hon and hon member and thank they again for their contribution thank the witness who give their time to the committee and those who provide write evidence finally extend my thank to the clerks the house staff and civil servant who have contribute to the passage of the bill for too long too little effort have be make to get grip on public sector fraud result in the totally unacceptable level that we see today with this bill we be take the power need to act and to finally take the fight to the crook and the con artist from criminal gang attack our welfare system to covid fraudster who steal from hard work people in time of national emergency this bill be critical it will save we billion of pound and it be part of broad package in the department to save billion for the dwp by hope that all member feel able to support it today question put and agree to new clause accordingly read second time and add to the bill proceeding interrupt programme order february the deputy

government be elect on mandate for change to create more good job in every corner of the country to drive up living standard for work people and to get our vital public service back on their foot deliver our plan for change mean ensure that every single pound of taxpayer money be wisely spend and go to those in genuine need that be what this legislation will help to deliver with the big ever crackdown on fraud against the public purse it be unacceptable that the conservative government allow fraud against the public sector to spiral to billion year that include staggering billion year of benefit fraud alone it be unforgiveable that they fail to ensure that the public sector fraud authority be fit for purpose or to properly update the dwp anti fraud power for long year when we think of all the new way in which fraudster and scam artist rip people off include by use datum and technology that simply beggar belief today we say no more our bill update the power of the public sector fraud authority so that it can effectively fight fraud across the public sector on behalf of government departments and public authority it also make vital upgrade to the dwp fraud power and set out new power to investigate fraud so that for the first time our serious and organised crime investigator can apply to the court for warrant to enter and search the premise of suspect fraudster and can seize evidence such as computer and phone there be update power to gather information so that we can compel third party such as airline to give we information and can require it to be deliver electronically so that we can tackle fraud as quick as possible our new eligibility verification measure will enable we to get crucial datum from bank and financial institution to check if people be get money they be not entitle to and if they have more saving than the rule allow or be fraudulently claim benefit abroad when they should be live in the uk the bill extend financial penalty to people who have fraudulently claim any type of dwp payment include grant and loan not just benefit and it give we new power to get money back from people who can pay but who have repeatedly fail to do so bring our power in line with those of other part of government such as the child maintenance service and hmrc all this be be do in fair and proportionate way the measure be tightly define in the legislation and there be strong safeguard and independent oversight include through annual report to parliament and code of practice which we will bring forward in committee in the other place thank the minister for transformation and the parliamentary secretary cabinet office for steer the bill through its committee and report stage support by excellent civil servant and house of commons staff thank all member of the public bill committee from right across the house for their detailed question and thoughtful scrutiny of the bill they have do this country good service because this bill provide we with the tool we need to tackle modern fraud in the benefit system and across the public sector help to save billion over the next five year as part of the dwp wide action to save total of billion from benefit fraud and error people who work hard and play by the rule and people who depend on our public service and vital benefit deserve to have trust and faith in the system and they be rightly angry when they see people abuse it our message be clear if you knowingly defraud the benefit system or cheat our public service whether you be large or small company criminal gang or an individual we will find you we will stop you and we will get our money back this labour government will restore trust and fairness in the system and ensure that every pound of public money deliver for the british people and our country commend this legislation to the house call the shadow minister every penny of taxpayer money lose to fraud or error be money waste so we conservative support many of the measure outline in the bill not least those that continue the hard work do by my colleague in the department for work and pensions prior to the general election the government have responsibility to ensure that every penny they raise in taxation be spend well that be fair to taxpayer who have work hard to earn that money when it come to welfare at the heart of our system must be the principle that government support should go only to those for whom it be intend every penny that do not undermine the entire system it erode public trust and support that have put support for some of the most vulnerable people in society at risk that be why in government we do the groundwork for the clause of the bill that enable bank to help crack down on fraudster recognise that while the state should never be able to see what someone spend their money on it should be able to check whether they be entitle to the money that they be claim the amendment we have table to the bill be constructive so be disappointed that the government have choose not to support they video from sickfluencer be hard to avoid when search online about benefit but rather than help people to claim something that they may need and should rightly receive the video tell people how to game the system we want taxpayer to get their money back even if it have already be spend why should we tolerate people use social medium platform to help other commit fraud and to help they cheat the test that be there to ensure that support go to those who need it why should someone who have commit fraud be able to keep their high end television or luxury car just because they spend their ill get gain before the department get to they we be clear that both those thing should be tackle but sadly labour have show itself to be on the side of the fraudster as say at the outset we back the overall purpose of the bill and much of its content but hope that the secretary of state colleague in the other place will take note of the constructive approach we have take and the argument make particularly those make so articulately by my hon friend the member for south west devon rebecca smith today and in committee look forward to

minister esher and walton be river community the thames form our boundary with london its water have bring viking to raid walton and king to live in hampton court and it be love by my constituent we have row club in molesey and walton that generate home grow olympians the ajax and viking sea scout and wild swimming group we have riverside business that contribute to our local economy and provide

length of my constituency from the ditton through molesey and down into walton on thames there be wreck vessel half sink and rusting on the bank opposite hampton court palace visible to the hundred of thousand of tourist who visit next door there be overstay boat which one constituent describe as small village it be dickensian the overstay boat be almost always unregistered they turn up moor and then stay for month sometimes year in addition to this impunity they generate litter and waste some boat apparently operate as airbnbs other have erect fence they have fence off public land on the towpath put up keep out and private sign and intimidate resident stretch of land our riverbank enjoy for century by my constituent have become no go area characterise by drug use and antisocial behaviour commend the hon lady for introduce this debate speak to she beforehand to hear her thought on what she hop to achieve represent constituency that be equally as nice as hers and can well understand the desire to stay and take advantage of the lovely location on the river thames however the people she describe be take advantage and prevent other from have enjoyment that be mean for all do she agree that we must have regulation in place that allow for reasonable enjoyment without people take advantage the hon gentleman make the main point that want to make today will speak about

fly tipping dog fouling and antisocial behaviour that be profoundly unfair on my constituent resident who pay their taxis have lose the river as they know it rowing club and boat hire and paddle board company be unable to launch resident with boat who want to take they out and moor alongside riverside restaurant and cafés be unable to do so the molesey regatta which have be fixture of my community since and in which declare an interest as an honorary president have be require to alter the course of its race in october single clean up of one stretch of riverbank populate by these boat yield more than tonne of waste the environment agency have fail to get to grip with the situation over period of year mean that the number of such boat in elmbridge have rise steadily at the last count the tally be approach in maidenhead the local authority and generous individual have take matter into their own hand and have be able to get rid of many sunken boat along our stretch of the thames the ea have regard owner of land as be responsible but lot of riverbank owner be not know we do not know who lot of the mooring owner be and that cause significant delay and cost do my hon friend agree that it be time for the environment agency to step up and take responsibly it should be support our community rather than try to pass on responsibility to unknown landowner my hon friend be absolutely right in my constituency the sense of frustration and disappointment with the environment agency be palpable when highly visible problem go unaddresse year after year as it have for decade and when situation be allow to deteriorate it create deep sense of disappointment and frustration and it undermine the faith that people have in the government to deal with the thing that affect people day to day life recognise the frustration and problem that my hon friend be have get the relevant supervisory authority to pay heed in brecon we have similar issue the canal might run dry follow welsh water decision to start charge the canal river trust for the water it extract yet none of the relevant authority have respond to our request for meeting do my hon friend agree that in instance like that it would be helpful for the minister whose department be implicate to pay attention they should come to brecon and help we to find solution thank my hon friend for his intervention but would like the minister to come to esher and walton first although appreciate his desire for she to visit his constituency as well my predecessor in esher and walton previous deputy prime minister bring the former environment secretary to see the problem for herself they commit to the permanent removal of these boat but nothing happen yet another broken conservative promise either my predecessor be uninterested or he be ineffective like many have hope that the new government would bring change write to the newly appoint secretary of state and the chief executive of the environment agency as soon as be elect ask for action at that point there be boat be pleased with the minister reply which acknowledge that the ea as the navigation authority along the non tidal thames be commit to manage the situation and to deliver detailed action plan lay out clear step for enforcement be assure that ea official wish to regain the trust of the community as result of that letter the ea tow away two of the large and long staying boat during an enforcement day hooray elmbridge borough council housing department join the operation and model join up approach with the police and the environment agency to respond to any homelessness issue my local council be ready and willing to play its part but it be frustrate that the ea be not play its part the enforcement success in the autumn should have mark the beginning of renew energy and action with long term plan to finally get to grip with the problem instead it be follow up with almost nothing and the situation have since deteriorate that be despite month and month of advocacy and regular meeting with the ea in which have hear again and again about its intention to clear the boat it have consistently overpromise and underdelivered be promise survey of abandon vessel before comprehensive removal and long term strategic enforcement plan as prelude to make progress in the spring well it be spring now but both document be endlessly delay last month the ea finally produce the survey but it be present so confusingly that the council find it almost useless and be now tell that the ea can not resource any of it when the plan come it be manifestly insufficient in today letter the minister reference that document the thames waterway compliance and enforcement plan for elmbridge which have read it run for page and make one minor mention of take action to reduce the number of unauthorised and unregistered boat which should have be the central focus as one of its tactical objective the plan promise to develop clear and tactical plan we have yet another promise but no plan all in all the document mark dramatic back of previous ambition it have an almost complete lack of measurable target metric and accountability mechanism in other word there be no way to assess the progress of the ea in deliver outcome against agree objective or on key concern such as the number of boat remove the number of registration offence or the rubbish clear in fact at our last meeting the area manager suggest that the problem have become so big that it be too expensive to fix be grateful to my constituency neighbour for give way river have two bank and we share one of they congratulate spelthorne borough council the ea and the police on do such good job on the spelthorne side offer my support to the hon member in her endeavour to make her side of the river well if we can give any assistance we will of course do so be grateful to my constituency neighbour would love to work with he the environment agency our relevant borough council and the police in order to fix this problem thank the hon lady for give way in such an important debate entirely share her frustration about progress with these boat this issue affect many of my constituent not just in weybridge but across my constituency be sure that she will come on to this point give the nature of river do she agree that positive step forward would be work with my hon friend the member for spelthorne lincoln jopp the hon member for maidenhead mr reynolds and the minister to try to get group together so that rather than push the boat on we can tackle the issue once and for all thank the hon member my constituency neighbour for that point have no intention at all of push the boat down to his constituency want they go there can be nothing more powerful for our constituent than we work across party in order to fix this problem the bbc pick up on this story this morning the ea give statement to bbc radio surrey in which it claim to be take firm lawful and proportionate action that be manifestly not the case the action be not firm or proportionate it also say that the current situation highlight the need for more sustainable systemic response and pledge long term approach this be the same hot air that we have hear for year and year waffle on about the need for long term plan while the situation deteriorate all in all this be sad indictment of the poverty of ambition application and competence in body charge by taxpayer with protect our waterway indeed it be hard to overstate the disappointment of my constituent at the seem inability of the environment agency to deliver result even against objective that it or the secretary of state have set this be the endless cycle the most basic promise make to resident the council or be jettison after month of prevarication the goal that remain be without measurement or accountability worry from the minister letter to this afternoon that regrettably nothing will change apart from her very kind ask of the environment agency to review its enforcement approach and her commitment to strengthen the ea approach be keen to hear how she intend to follow up on those point be deeply frustrated that much of the letter repeat what my resident and the council have be hear from the ea for month and year promise of new plan and more join up working and recognition of past disappointment and the need for change the environment agency say that it want to regain the trust of my constituent that trust be at rock bottom what be need now be far great oversight ministerial if necessary and accountability against specific and deliverable goal recently attend public meeting with resident of hurst park and molesey on friday night that be pack to the rafter with constituent deeply upset and justifiably angry with the situation the essence of what people call break britain be the sense that the public realm be incapable of solve problem even the most egregious and obvious one those that people and business see and feel every single day the prime minister and member of the government have speak repeatedly about the need to rebuild trust in the state rebuild its capacity and show the people that system can work and achieve thing something that my resident and have find particularly frustrating be the difficulty of attach any accountability at all to anyone at any point despite failure after failure failure to act deprive these people who be privileged to represent those who play by the rule and pay for public service of the land peace and natural beauty that they have always enjoy ask the minister to give this matter her personal attention and to work with to solve it as matter of priority would like she to work with to show the people of esher and walton that good politic make thing well boat list by the environment agency as wreck or abandon can and should be clear immediately do so quickly and forcefully rather than piecemeal remove one of the permanent risk of those boat namely that change in river condition could dislodge vessel and transform they into immediate hazard clear overstayed boat require take legal step and it be vital that this work be consistently and properly resource take start and stop approach be not an option because many enforcement mechanism unlock by serve initial notice on boat must be complete within certain period of time let opportunity disappear set everything back to square one the local police and the local council be ready and eager to help and have put resource aside to do their part as such will the minister commit personally to drive forward meaningful action on this issue through the environment agency and the department for environment food and rural affairs to provide the necessary energy and resource and to give point of contact with official in her department to co ordinate our work will she also commit to meet either in this place or in my constituency where the problem can be see and believe to discuss the progress that we can make together the problem of overstay and sunken boat should not be intractable everyone can see the problem and the solution be obvious it be time to show that collectively we can deliver it be always pleasure to serve under your chairwomanship madam deputy speaker congratulate the hon member for esher and walton monica harding on secure this important debate and welcome the contribution from the hon member for spelthorne lincoln jopp and for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer as well in an adjournment debate it be very nice to see cross party work on an issue of local importance interruption also thank the hon member for maidenhead mr reynolds the minister will have hear the point we have make about the lack of supervisory authority will she write to the welsh minister responsible and ask he to look into the case of the brecon canal order the hon gentleman be very quick on his foot call the minister obviously water be devolved matter do not want to get into an issue for which power be devolve or would be instruct welsh minister about what they should or should not be do encourage the hon member to write back to the welsh minister and maybe copy in the secretary of state for wales that might be one way forward rather than minister in this place be see to tell minister in different government what they should or should not be do that would be stretch the confine of this debate to which will now return we have hear much this evening about the benefit that our river and canal bring to so many people in our constituency benefit that have be very eloquently articulate by hon member we have hear about the vikings about olympians and about how important waterway be to everyone in our area be pleased to hear about the enforcement success in the autumn but obviously disappoint to hear that progress have not be what it should have be will come on to that issue later our inland waterway be an asset to our country they be important to our national heritage and provide many public benefit people live on they enjoy be by they and use they for leisure and recreation as well as their historical value they form an important part of our natural environment by provide green corridor along which biodiversity can flourish as well as contribute to the growth of local economy such as through domestic tourism we have hear quite lot about that this evening the hon member for esher and walton have eloquently speak of the beauty and tranquillity of the river in her constituency and it be indeed one of our most majestic river as it wind its way along our navigation authority have an important role to play into the future and pay tribute to they all as they maintain our waterway for the benefit of all user pay tribute to their staff

water transfer the hon member have speak in detail about overstayed boat in elmbridge and about boat that be illegally moor or derelict abandon or sink she have draw particular attention to the adverse impact that that be have on the use and enjoyment of the river by other waterway user include those walk along the thames path be concerned to hear account of antisocial behaviour and abuse direct at people try to enjoy the riverway she have also describe her interaction with the environment agency as the navigation authority for the non tidal river thames and with other local authority in the area in seek to find satisfactory resolution be pleased to hear the comment about the willingness of the local council and the police to work together on this issue recognise the seriousness of the issue in elmbridge and neighbouring constituency the understandable strength of feeling locally and the need for co ordinate action to address they assure the hon member that the environment agency which have speak to also understand that and be look to develop specific action towards resolution note the point she make about it have deliverable plan and be see to be take action in fairness let mention the wide context in which the environment agency be work when it come to enforcement any enforcement have to be within the law and careful and proportionate it have discretionary landowner power not statutory duty create limitation for action on private land and where enforcement would cause disproportionate harm have have countless meeting with the ea link with elmbridge and in try to deal with this problem particularly in desborough cut and weybridge do the minister think that the ea have sufficient power in statute to be able to tackle this issue she just mention discretionary power do we need to change the law so that this can be deal with once and for all thank the hon gentleman for his helpful intervention be inform by the environment agency that it do have the power but want to take that point away and question the ea about that be it question of need different power or be the power there through the council and perhaps the police work together have bring up those point with the environment agency and the council they appear to have the statutory power to act whether they have the will and resource to do it be the stick point hope to come on to address some of the thing that the ea want to do where boat be home especially in case of potential vulnerability the environment agency need to work with local housing and safeguard team to assess welfare concern that be why it be so important welcome the hon lady comment on this that the council be willing to work together the question be about whether the power be available to remove the boat but if there be risk of people become homeless the situation become more complicated thank the minister for give way again as describe when the two large overstayed boat that have occupant be remove elmbridge borough council be there provide support for those people the police be also there there be no problem with the manoeuvre that take place on that day be really pleased to hear that be also pleased when the hon lady mention that in her speech as an effective example of agency work together to achieve the same aim the environment agency must use its resource to ensure effective enforcement along the entire mile length of the river the point have be make about not want to move problem somewhere else where similar pressure exist balance cost and benefit against other priority when removal be necessary it must be carry out within the safety parameter of the river and when the river be flow fast the removal may be temporarily suspend completely accept the point make this evening that the environment agency progress in take appropriate action be not as fast as the hon lady would like it to be but it be none the less positive and look to the long term rather than series of short term measure the agency have deploy time staff resource and financial investment in elmbridge although as have say recognise that it have not do so with the speed that the hon lady would like it have use specialist officer legal team and contractor with more than spend in on enforcement operation ongoing legal action and vessel removal in the elmbridge area several derelict or sunken vessel have be remove between hampton court and shepperton and legal proceeding continue follow court ruling cover part of the elmbridge bank downstream of sunbury lock which be be appeal against trespass notice have be issue where necessary and advice have be give to boater on registration conduct and waste responsibility the hon lady give some example of awful behaviour include litter and the environment agency have also remove boater waste accumulation from agency and local authority land on april it publish strategic framework for enforcement throughout the mile stretch of the river and it tell that it have develop an elmbridge specific compliance and enforcement plan that have be share with local partner for the purpose of their input however in the light of the concern raise by the hon lady and her constituent and by the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer the agency be develop long term land management strategy to reduce reliance on enforcement and create more sustainable outcome instead it include the feasibility of additional lawful mooring agreement for register boater support local authority duty for homelessness and housing and biodiversity enhancement to deter trespass in sensitive area the agency will be strengthen collaboration with elmbridge borough council surrey police and community partner on necessary enforcement action as well as continue current enforcement deploy ment over the come month in wide context it be certainly true that the legislative landscape surround navigation management be complex and that this be largely historical legacy with the change use of waterway over time new challenge have emerge in relation to for instance residential mooring and they should be take into account in the shaping of future regulation and planning we hear helpful suggestion about the possibility of member form group to discuss this matter if such group be to be convene and if be to be invite to join it would be happy to attend meeting to discuss what more can be do in this regard hope have reassure the member who have attend this debate that we as government greatly value our inland waterway and the work that the navigation authority do to bring so many benefit to so many people hope have also reassure they that the environment agency be determined to ensure that its approach to enforcement be fair and proportionate and will deliver tangible last outcome where the impact be most acute question put and agree to house adjourn
