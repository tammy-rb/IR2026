with permission would like to make statement about the future of our high education sector and the change that we will be make for student in the upcoming academic year before go far want to make clear the approach that this labour government take to our university and above all to the student whose education be their central purpose because the conservative government do not just talk down university they talk down the aspiration of working class family across our country and they dismiss the ambition of our young people and undermine their opportunity this government take different approach we be determined to break down the barrier to opportunity and high education be central to that mission high education be part of what make our country great it enrich our culture power our economy and sustain intellectual tradition stretch back century it be beacon of opportunity to student not just from this country but from across the world and sector of which everyone in this house ought to be proud but when this government take office in july we find university sector face severe financial challenge with tuition fee freeze for the last seven year university have suffer significant real term decline in their income we also find regulator subject to political whim unable to focus on the challenge our university face succession of conservative ministers face with tough decision have for year after year duck they time and again we inherit in our university as across so much of our public sector the consequence of long year of shameful abdication of responsibility long year in which hear too often from student of the gap between the course they be promise and the experience they have about the trouble they have make end meet as they work hard not merely at their study but often at two or more job on top long year in which see the amazing research our university deliver but how infrequently those triumph drive wide success and long year in which hear from international student who make such an important contribution to our country that the previous government have make they feel neither value nor welcome that be the mess that opposition member leave behind but where the conservatives shirk the hard choice this government have not hesitate to grip the challenge we face and take the tough decision to restore stability to high education to fix the foundation and to deliver change we have accept in full the recommendation of the independent review of the office for students we have also bring new leadership to the office and refocus its work to monitor university finance and to hold leadership to account thank sir david behan for his work both lead the independent review and now as its interim chair we have pause the commencement of the last government freedom of speech legislation while we consider the impact on university student and the regulator because although university must be home to robust discussion and rigorous challenge regulation must also be workable be here today to make two set of announcement on high education reform address the challenge our student and university face and grip these issue as responsible government first we will fix the foundation we will secure the future of high education so that student can benefit from world class education for generation to come that be why be announce that in line with the forecast set out in the budget last week from april we will be increase the maximum cap for tuition fee in line with inflation to an increase of per academic report november vol correction understand that some student may worry about the impact that the increase will have on their loan debt so want to reassure student already at university that when they start repay their loan they will not see high monthly repayment as result of these change to fee and maintenance loan that be because student loan be not like consumer loan monthly repayment depend on earning not simply the amount borrow or interest rate and at the end of any loan term any outstanding loan balance include interest build up will be write off increase the fee cap have not be an easy decision but want to be crystal clear that this will not cost graduate more each month as they start to repay their loan university be responsible for manage their own finance and must act to remain sustainable but member across the house will agree that it be no use keep tuition fee down for future student if the university be not there for they to attend nor if student can not afford to support themselves while they study therefore confirm that we will boost support for student with living cost by increase maximum maintenance loan in line with inflation give they an additional year in also confirm that from the start of the academic year low fee limit of will be introduce for foundation year in classroom base subject such as business social science and humanity the government recognise the importance of foundation year for promote access to high education but they can be deliver more efficiently in classroom base subject at low cost to student the change that the government be bring about must go far so my second set of announcement signal the start of deep change for our student our university and our country today will set out the scale of our ambition to build high education system fit for the challenge not just of today but of tomorrow in the month ahead we will publish our proposal because in university as across our public service investment can come only with the promise of major reform the contribution of high education to our economy our community and our country must grow and strengthen that begin with university do more to spread opportunity to disadvantaged student in both expand access and improve outcome our most recent datum show why the gap between disadvantaged student and their peer in progression to university by age be the high on record will not tolerate that shameful divide any long university can and must do more and they must rise to the huge challenge of technological change support adult with the flexibility that they need to retrain that be why we confirm in the budget that we be press ahead with the lifelong learning entitlement while the uk be home to many world class university it be time that all student in high education in this country feel the benefit it be time to raise the bar far on teaching standard to improve our world lead reputation and drive out poor practice and it be time to ensure that all student get good value for money which if we be honest have not always be the case in the past furthermore university must do more to raise their impact beyond their gate they must do more to drive the growth that this country sorely need by attract talent from around the world join with skills england employer and partner in further education to deliver the skill that people and business need and shape world class research to create good job across the country member across the house will know how important university can be for the area that surround they not just local economy but local community want university to work hard to embed themselves in those local community as civic anchor the beat heart of local life in our town and city not ivory tower far from local concern lie beneath those challenge must be further transformation renew drive for efficiency student and taxpayer support the cost of our university they be right to expect that every penny be spend effectively we will not accept wasteful spending university must rise to the challenge which mean ensure that the pay of their top team be fair and justifiable be determined that our world class high education sector do not merely survive in the year ahead but thrive support student in every corner of our country and at every stage of their life be determined that our university become all that know they can be the scale of our ambition demand new approach root in partnership so look forward to partnering with the sector the office for students and uk research and innovation will work closely with ministers

the future be remind that more than year have pass since the robbins report on high education be present to this house with its famous principle that course of high education should be available for all those who be qualified by ability and attainment to pursue they and who wish to do so that principle drive the expansion of high education over the decade that follow under successive government of both party it be central to the thinking of this government today that be why responsible government must treat university not as political battleground but as public good it be why government member want to see the continued success of our young people and it be why we be determined to ensure the sustainability and success of our high education sector not just in the year ahead but for decade to come commend this statement to the house
