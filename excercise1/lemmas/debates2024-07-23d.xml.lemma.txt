believe it be customary in maiden speech for the member to pay tribute to their predecessor which be very happy to do giles watling be very decent nice honourable man he be former actor who wear his garrick club tie there be nothing even vaguely conservative about he but he be jolly nice chap and it be clean fought campaign early the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes make reference to clacton as be the place for traditional english seaside holiday and indeed it be with its pier mile of sandy beach and arcade perhaps it be not holiday destination that be as popular as it use to be now that people go to spain and elsewhere but it be still there other part of the constituency be genteel and quite wealthy but if we go to jaywick we find the most deprived community in the whole united kingdom those community have little faith trust or belief that government can make their life well indeed what find when knock on door be that people be say we want to work we want to get on and make money but as soon as we work hour week or more our benefit get take away so we well off stay on benefit feel immensely sorry for those people because the benefit system which be design to help they be actually keep they trap in level of relative poverty will do my good as the mp for the area to bring business investment private money into the constituency with job training and skill can not promise that will do it but will do my absolute damnedest to make it happen it be funny because spend nearly year as member of the european parliament in brussels and with its monthly journey to strasbourg have to say that this place be very different indeed it be small there be not chauffeur drive mercedes available for each member there be no large lump sum of money that member do not have to spend on anything or show receipt for wonder whether that be why so many in the british political system seem to adore the european union so much because it be rather wonderful place to work what do not expect be to come here and find that with my reform team be more outnumber here than we be in the european parliament because there be more supporter of brexit in the european parliament than sense there be in this parliament of this be very much remainer parliament suspect in many case that it be really rejoiner parliament if we look at the king speech it be interesting that the word immigration be mention only twice and asylum just once perhaps that be not surprise as when the now prime minister lay out the six big priority for the labour party before the general election he do not mention legal or illegal immigration that be the other area in which the five of we sit on the reform bench will find ourselves massively outnumber in the house because we actually want to talk about these issue believe that the population explosion be have big impact on the quality of life of ordinary folk than any other issue it all start of course when the current home secretary become member of parliament back in may it be worth remind ourselves that net migration be the same during the late the whole of the the whole of the the whole of the the whole of the and in the up until mr blair net migration run at to year for over half century then mr blair get in and decide that we be go to open the door in way that have never be do before to the delight and joy of big company especially giant multinational who have always want as much cheap labour as they can get and to hell with the consequence for working class family and people perhaps it be even more of surprise to see that massive acceleration in our population through immigration then far accelerate because despite promise in four consecutive manifesto the conservative party actually accelerate what have happen under the year of mr blair so we have see population increase of million people since the time that labour win its last landslide even the net figure be migrant minute even during the course of this debate many hundred more people will have come to our country nobody be make the argument that there be not some exceptionally wonderful people among they there be of course but the sheer level of population mean we have to build new house every two minute even if the labour government be able to fulfil the million house that they want to build during the lifetime of this parliament that will make no dent at all in the current shortage of housing rent have rise by since why population increase and pressure the list go on from access to health service to congestion and pressure on infrastructure the population crisis have the big impact on people life damage their quality of life and virtually nobody in this place even want to talk about it it be on illegal immigration that really want to make point four year ago go out into the english channel repeatedly film dinghy come across the channel with an average of people per boat be describe as be sad lonely desperate figure always seek attention and have no doubt there be some who think that be still the case today
