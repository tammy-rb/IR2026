call for more diplomatic pressure to be place on hamas by the qataris include the threat to exile the leadership of hamas from doha unless we see the immediate and unconditional release of the remain hostage that be the kind of diplomatic pressure that must be bring to bear instead the israeli government have choose path that even president trump netanyahu big cheerleader appear appal by let be clear liberal democrats support the right of the state of israel to exist and its right to defend itself like all nation but israel have obligation under international law and duty to its ally both of which it have breach can the minister confirm whether any uk entity include the joint command at the al udeid airbase be inform by israel of the attack in advance will he confirm that in addition to what he have already say the prime minister in his meeting with president herzog today will condemn yesterday attack in the strong possible term and make it clear that the uk view it as flagrant

injure child and to provide fully fund scholarship to the uk call dame emily thornberry chair of the select committee what happen overnight illustrate huge problem that the new foreign secretary will need to deal with be pleased that the minister will be ably help she the problem be this there be an emboldened far right israeli government who believe that they can do whatever they like and there will be no consequence while on the other hand the country of qatar be genuinely work towards peace know the minister have meet the qatari ministers have meet they too they could not be more sincere in the effort they be make yet they get bomb for their effort the question for the new foreign secretary be how we can make sure that we be not just bystander but play an active role in deal with this issue how will the prime minister be able to convey such message to president herzog this afternoon thank my right hon friend for the question it be vital that at such serious moment that the un

counterpart this afternoon and we will be discuss this matter as my right hon friend would expect with range of ally include the united states we come now to shadow foreign secretary this be clearly very very serious moment for the middle east no one in this house want to see spiral of escalation of hostility both israel and qatar be important and value strategic partner for the united kingdom and we value and recognise the extensive effort by the qatari government to secure the release of hostage and work towards secure ceasefire it be tragic as the minister have highlight that security guard be kill in this attack but there be some fundamental issue here and many of these point have be make from the dispatch box time and again this be moment for our country britain must contribute and provide the british expertise necessary for conflict resolution and support strong regional initiative include back qatar and the qataris on release the hostage and achieve ceasefire on top of that of course we must work with our ally in the united states and next week visit from president trump be crucial moment there can be no more equivocation as this issue continue to afflict the region day after day after day it be also true that we certainly should not be mourn the hamas leader who have be kill hamas have hold innocent hostage in terrorist captivity for over day and they be responsible for the atrocity of october which also kill british national in recent month israel have be remove terrorist actor across the middle east the leadership of the houthis hezbollah and malign individual in the iranian regime too that mean that our government must play strong role and stand firm on degrade iran nuclear capability and that malign influence in the region in recognise the sensitivity of the situation in the gulf will the minister confirm what action he and the fcdo will take to stabilise effort to secure the release of the hostage what proactive step be be take to degrade hamas and their capability and of course how we can work constructively with our partner in the region to drive the right outcome include achieve ceasefire thank the right hon lady for those important question the british government be fully commit with our gulf and partner to effort to ensure that the current negotiation come to the conclusion that we wish to see those include conclusion in the short term we have long repudiate hamas hostage taking so the hostage need to be release immediately and humanitarian aid must get into gaza as say in response to the hon member for bicester and woodstock calum miller there be also other question about governance and security and about the long term prospect for gaza for the west bank and for state of palestine and state of israel live side by side we be fully engage in that diplomacy as the right hon lady would expect on the right hon lady wide question about fragility in the region she will be familiar with the decision we have take on snapback imagine that we will return to discuss iran in great detail at some point in the future as be conscious that there be development over recess we have trigger snapback and we will continue to return to the house to discuss the threat of iran nuclear programme the long that israel be allow to act like rogue state bomb sovereign country with impunity and expand its war in the middle east the weak our word look gaza lebanon yemen iran syria tunisian soil and now qatar why be we meet israel president herzog today when his own word and those of netanyahu show complete disregard for international humanitarian law pay tribute to my hon friend for her work on whole range of question include current effort to try to ensure the successful evacuation of vulnerable people from gaza it be important that we raise our concern directly to the israeli government both to contribute to the diplomatic process and to try to secure the practical and tangible help require to get people out of gaza the british foreign office on its own can not secure the speedy departure that we wish to see do not the event of yesterday underline the critical need to secure ceasefire and above all to move into political process will the minister we be all pleased to see he continue in his role follow the reshuffle commit to building on the important work do by egypt turkey qatar and saudi arabia to effect that peace process all of they have underline the fact that there be no place for hamas in gaza or anywhere else in government follow the event that have take place be grateful for the kind word from the right hon gentleman and indeed for those hear from the labour back benches be continue in my role and look forward to appear before the house in the usual way he be right to emphasise not just the important statement from the uk and our western ally but the important commitment that have be make particularly in july but since then as well by qatar egypt turkey and range of other state which have real role to play in mediate the immediate pressure and in try to end up in as he say the more permanent ceasefire that we want to see thank the minister for outline the strong condemnation of the attack and the blatant disregard for qatar sovereignty refer the house to my register interest as visit qatar last year and speak to ministers there see how diligently they be work day in and day out to secure the ceasefire and the hostage and to get that urgent aid in do the minister share my view that qatar role in mediate this conflict will be blow into jeopardy by the recent attack and will he ensure that the prime minister continue to condemn this attack when he meet the israeli president later this week my hon friend be quite right qatar have play vital role in this conflict work closely with my qatari counterpart and not just on the urgent issue of the middle east but across whole range of difficult conflict they play vital role and be commit as the emir of qatar tell the prime minister this morning to continue to play that mediation role can not see how such strike help qataris perform that role but they be commit none the less to continue it and they have our full support the event of yesterday come as no surprise to those of we in the chamber who have raise the issue of the israeli government crime commit with an air of complete impunity it should now be crystal clear to the minister as it be to so many across the world that the israeli government be not interested in the slight in peace or indeed in the fate of their hostage in that light have two question first what military and intelligence assistance will we provide to the qataris to allow they to defend themselves against further attack secondly will the uk add its voice to the grow call across the world for the formation of an international protection force to enter gaza and enforce peace on the right hon gentleman first point we be commit to qatar security and defence we have close relationship with the qataris on both and we be of course in constant discussion with they about the importance of that collaboration on his second point about protective force and here will take advantage of the question ask by the right hon member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell who be secretary of state for international development when be post in south sudan with chapter vii un peacekeeping force which at that time have the most far reach mandate to protect civilian we in this chamber can not pretend that un peacekeeping force be able to impose peace where there be none there must be ceasefire negotiation in juba see as do the world the horrifying ethnic cleansing that follow the inability of the un mission to protect people we must have ceasefire it be easy to get distract with other alternative but the truth be that only ceasefire will protect civilian in gaza give that under article of the un charter any pre emptive strike be normally regard as justify only when threat be imminent that article state that all member shall refrain in their international relation from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state and that article state that measure take by member in the exercise of this right of self defence shall be immediately report to the security council do my hon friend agree that international law and the preservation and strengthening of the rule base system be vital to the people of the region the wide world our ally qatar and the uk will he make it clear to israel that we expect it to obey international law we expect israel alongside all of our ally and indeed every state to abide by international law my hon friend set out the relevant test of self defence and imminence as have say the uk be support motion for an urgent session of the security council this afternoon on this question member have already outline how israel have violate international law by attack qatar will the uk government lie therefore down motion at the un to condemn the action of israel as have say the uk be support motion for session of the un security council this afternoon if that motion be grant the session be expect to take place this evening our time israel be rogue state that blatantly disregard international law this bombing be blatant attempt to scupper peace negotiation plead with israel will do no good so how many more war crime or violation of international law be necessary before the government impose the tough sanction on israel that be need to force it to stop this think cover the point about sanction early be surprised and disappoint that there be no word from the secretary of state in relation to the terrorist attack in jerusalem on monday where terrorist open fire on bus kill rabbi and woman the reality be that hamas leadership not only condone the attack but praise it do the minister agree that it be essential that we get to the point of have ceasefire that allow for the release of all the hostage without condition and for hamas to surrender their weapon and agree to demilitarise gaza be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise the attack in jerusalem which condemn utterly and outright it be barbaric and as he say woman and rabbi be kill the uk have no truck with it and we condemn it outright just as we condemn all such activity by hamas include the taking of hostage the event of october and the long litany of terrorist attack that they be responsible for and glorify benjamin netanyahu extrajudicial killing against sovereign western ally expose his rejection of peace and deliberate escalation of atrocity in clear violation of international law and diplomacy he have destroy the peace talk and act with impunity the uk government have rightly condemn these action but when will they uphold international law call out the israeli prime minister as warmonger and perpetrator of genocide end arm sale to israel and impose the severe sanction that his conduct demand the prime minister set out some of what our government have do in relation to the suspension of arm sale and sanction on extremist figure in the israeli government so will not belabour those point here on peace talk the emir of qatar be clear that the qataris will continue in their mediation role we should not count out peace talk while the qataris rightly continue to try to push they forwards israel bombing of doha be the action of state that know it can act with complete impunity once again the netanyahu regime have show that international law simply do not apply to it and as long as this government ignore the overwhelming evidence of the genocide in gaza so that they can profit from the sale of weapon to israel that situation will continue will minister tell we unless this be just another example of the performative condemnation that we have see so often from this government what exactly the consequence will be for israel for this egregious attack on qatar have set out some of the step that we be take in relation to this strike include support an emergency session of the un security council and have discussion with our ally include the which the foreign secretary will undertake shortly would not wish to be draw far as we discuss this very important incident with our ally take issue with the hon gentleman characterisation the conflict in gaza be not question that relate primarily to uk arm we be tiny supplier of residual arm we have suspend the sale of all of those arm that could be use in gaza there be other state with much full arm the figure be the hon gentleman say when in fact he mean of component of the total supply the truth about the total supply to israel be that it be less than the minister be absolutely right to call for session at the united nations nobody can think that attack the people try to broker peace be go to lead to ceasefire but ahead of that this country must have make some assessment of the case for the session and the motion will the minister tell we what assessment his official have make about the civilian casualty and whether this strike be proportionate under the boundary of the law of armed conflict as set out in international law if we go to the un what case will we be make would not want to be draw on casualty tally from the uk as set out in my response qatar have be clear about its own assessment and these thing tend to develop in the immediate aftermath of strike so will not be draw on casualty or the number of people strike qatar quite rightly will release that information when it be available my hon friend ask about the international law test against which this strike must be judge those test be self defence and imminence and in any session of the un security council those be the test that we would expect israel to be able to satisfy it be not only on this issue but on many other issue that qatar saudi arabia and other middle east nation have develop real niche and leadership in mediation and conflict resolution will the minister look at our own conflict resolution unit and its resource and spend and double down on how we be work with the qataris on all their mediation effort the right hon gentleman raise an important question the strength of our relationship with qatar on conflict mediation and our own capability be an important area of work understand deeply how important that be because be negotiator in the foreign office as be our national security adviser have be due further discussion with my qatari ministerial counterpart regrettably it have be continually delay by event in the region but we hope to have it soon qatar be an ally and key negotiator and mediator in gaza ceasefire talk through commit atrocity in gaza illegal settlement in the west bank march into syria and attack lebanon iran yemen and now qatar this israeli government have prove themselves to be rogue ally to we and dangerous neighbour at what point do the uk draw line in the sand and call out this israeli government for what they be danger to peace in the middle east thank my hon friend for his long commitment to these issue he have hear my condemnation as well as that of the previous foreign secretary the current foreign secretary and the prime minister of many of the israeli government action in relation to gaza the west bank and elsewhere where we disagree with the israeli government we be clear and forceful in say so give that israel continue to act with impunity what new lever will our government use to take action that be within its power such as restriction on travel and trade air and sea delivery of aid give that land delivery be so appalling and in relation to the we be breach international humanitarian law can we please stop do so do not like to get ahead of the court on the question of the there be extensive legal argumentation in the al haq case which do not find in the way the hon gentleman suggest turn to the question of air and sea access to gaza both method have be try the uk support airdrop alongside our jordanian partner over the summer such be our desperation to get aid into the strip however we can not escape the fact that airdrop be pinprick at well give the overall scale of need there be an aid operation that work and have track record which be the united nations operation and sea sea be also try particularly during the late period of president biden but be not find to be an effective mechanism for get aid in where we can get aid in even in small amount we will do so but can not pretend from this dispatch box that any method other than the land route and un support can reach the scale that be require to meet the need be pleased to see the minister back at the dispatch box although be not sure whether he be equally pleased to come back to the chamber once again to answer question about the illegal action of the israeli government we have situation in which one of our ally have unlawfully attack another of our ally give that we be rightly stand with the qataris be it not time we recognise that because of their action in doha and their continuous starvation and murder of innocent civilian in gaza this right wing israeli government and this extreme right wing israeli prime minister be no long ally of our thank my hon friend for his kind word about my reappointment recognise the force of what he have say about israeli politic it be not appropriate for one foreign minister to comment on the internal politic of another country but from the sanction announce from this dispatch box in june the house can see the strength of this government feel about for example the rhetoric of mr smotrich and that of mr ben gvir it have be deeply dishearten to see that rhetoric repeat over the course of the summer but where we can we demonstrate in the strong possible way the strength of our feeling on these question the event that take place early this week in jerusalem and yesterday prove that the two extreme in this conflict have no interest in peace hamas benefit from the violence and the right wing of the israeli government also profit as it seek to expand israel territory and subject the palestinian people entirely agree with my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse and amplify the point that he make follow yesterday event trump and the american administration appear to be as annoyed with israel as the rest of the world be so be it now time to call israel bluff through the united nations be it not time to seek the engagement of blue helmet or some similar force to enable we to say we as an international community have people on the ground do you dare fire into that area let we now trigger peace talk without that catalyst those two extreme will just continue along with the performative merry go round of here we go again condemnation and another statement or urgent question fear that in three or four year time there will be rubble in gaza the israeli government will be even more of rogue government and we will be no far forward the right hon gentleman be absolutely right about the risk in gaza we have see that rubble grow the british government would support international force go into gaza with the agreement of the party in response to the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse speak about my own experience of the limitation on peacekeeping force where there be no peace to enforce we be depressingly clear eyed about the continue intent on both side to continue conduct violence exactly as the right hon gentleman have describe in the past month alone israel have bomb palestine lebanon syria tunisia and yemen yesterday for the first time it bomb qatar what be the government legal assessment of the strike on qatar and do they consider they to be violation of international law we utterly condemn the violation of qatar sovereignty as the house hear from the prime minister this morning as my hon friend the member for rugby john slinger set out the international legal test be to do with imminence and self defence there will be session of the un security council and it will be for israel to demonstrate how its action be consistent with those test today of all day after an illegal attack on peace broker qatar it be shocking to see the uk roll out the red carpet for president herzog who have dehumanise suffer palestinians and incite violence against civilian the minister government be be see to pander to politician who flout international law he rightly call for ceasefire when will he call what be happen in gaza genocide president herzog be in the uk on private visit so would not characterise the visit as one for which the red carpet have be roll out reiterate that so many colleague on the government benches and be sure colleague on the opposition benches as well be rightly very conscious of the urgency of help people out of gaza ensure that aid get in and ensure that there be ceasefire president herzog be the head of state he be not functional part of the government he be an important conduit for raise those concern this morning among other thing the foreign secretary seek to ensure great support from the israeli government for get child with injury and student out of gaza these be difficult practical matter on which we be focused understand that some opposition members would perhaps prefer that we do not conduct such talk but the government and be focus on the practical problem of help people in gaza and the foreign secretary have already raise they with the president this morning this morning on radio an israeli politician fleur hassan nahoum offer no apology for the israeli attack on qatar and could not explain what make israel exempt from international law and able to act with impunity how do the minister justify the genocidal comment of president herzog these individual must be hold accountable what we be see be not diplomacy it be shameful complicity do the minister agree that today meeting with herzog should never have take place set out the position in relation to president herzog visit just minute ago be not familiar with the israeli politician in question but can say that the uk consider international law to be bind on all state despite the atrocious terrorist attack in jerusalem have to agree with the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy when she say that blow up the enemy negotiator do not exactly suggest an interest in negotiate solution however would like clarification on the government position on recognition of palestinian state on september the then foreign secretary say that he propose to recognise palestinian state but that hamas would not benefit from it because they would have to be disarm do that mean that hamas must be disarm before recognition or will recognition go ahead as seem to be the case whether hamas be disarm or not the prime minister and the foreign secretary then and now have be clear that the prime minister will make determination in advance of the un general assembly high level week in accordance with the language set out in the statement of july the right hon member make important point about what the previous foreign secretary say about hamas we must remember that hamas be not in favour of two state they be in favour of one state from the river to the sea and that be not the position of the british government and nor be it should we take the decision outline in july we all want to see peace the hostage return and an end to the man make famine in gaza but this attack on sovereign nation so closely tie to the peace talk undermine all that it be as awful as it be counterproductive so what can we do to ensure that the pursuit of peace be more than just lip service for the netanyahu government my hon friend have be persistent advocate on these question and look forward to continue to answer his question from the dispatch box he should not though be more pessimistic about the prospect of continue mediation and the qataris themselves particularly give that they be very much on the close edge to this issue we will continue to support they in their effort they be vital and for all the reason we have discuss this afternoon the only way through we keep talk about ceasefire but how can one be achieve if one side be intent on kill the negotiator from the other attack peace negotiator be simply reprehensible and undermine any possibility of the only thing dialogue that have any chance of bring resolution to the horror in gaza it be not the action of state seek peace it be the action of rogue state operate with impunity completely outside international law cross red line after red line ask the minister again give that repeat crossing of new red line what action will he match his condemnation with will he stop all arm sale all military co operation all intelligence sharing and all defence deal current and future with israel will he sanction netanyahu and all official complicit in the war crime and genocide in gaza have set out already in this session our condemnation of the strike the sanction take against extremist figure in the israeli government and the other measure we have take in relation to action that follow from the strike on doha the foreign secretary will shortly be in touch with her colleague and we hope that there will be security council session this evening thank the minister for his statement do pray that one day he will come to the dispatch box with good news for we to be frank in my surgery at oxgangs library on saturday uk palestinian woman come to see she bring date cooky which have be freshly make by her mother have hop to save one for you mr speaker but it prove not to be possible she speak passionately and she be really concerned about the visit of the israeli president to the uk speak about what the government have be do and action that have support that believe have save life but with what we have see in qatar think netanyahu have make fool of we and fear that he will continue to make fool of we be it time to change direction to avoid this happen again to avoid we take stand demand ceasefire and netanyahu just laugh at we be disappointed that my hon friend constituent do not reserve cookie for but be grateful for the important question that she ask for the reason set out before it be important that we continue to engage directly with the israeli government particularly on question such as the evacuation of vulnerable people from gaza on which israel co operation be essential for any further progress several of our partner in the region in north africa and the middle east have expend great deal of political capital in try to achieve rapprochement with israel in recent year the minister will be aware for example of morocco and its work and leadership in achieve the abraham accord what do he think this attack have do to they and what confidence can they have that israel be now truly embark on quest for peace in the region even in advance of the event yesterday nation in the region that have take the step of sign the abraham accord be signal disquiet most obviously and signally the united arab emirates which release an important statement on this question will not seek to speak for our arab ally but be sure that they will be look at the event yesterday with great concern and be sure that the right hon gentleman will have see the number of statement that have issue from the region over the last hour man make famine in gaza increase settler violence in the west bank and now this attack on sovereign qatar fear that these be not the action of an israeli government commit to peace with that in mind will my hon friend urge the foreign secretary to speak to our friend and ally and find out what more we can do to pile concrete pressure on the israeli government to get round the table and seek that ceasefire that we so badly need thank my hon friend for his commitment to these issue and can confirm that the foreign secretary be practically as we speak in consultation with friend and ally about what further step we might take have say this before but so many constituent from yeovil some as young as have tell that they be so frustrated that britain be not do more will the minister reassure my constituent that the government be do all they can to make sure that these strike do not break down the peace process completely and that enough aid get into gaza now the hon gentleman young constituent be absolutely right and can reassure they that we be do everything we can to try to ensure that the mediation continue that progress towards ceasefire be make and of course that aid get into gaza blessed be the peacemaker or so we be tell so it seem particularly wicked that israel can deliberately target the country that be do more to promote peace than any other in the region be the tragedy of the middle east not that the palestinians in gaza and the israelis in israel be govern by deeply unpopular extremist who have no interest in peace on either side after this week appal murder at bus stop in jerusalem the israeli government impose collective punishment on the village where those terrorist come from remove hundred of work permit and proceed to start demolish many home do netanyahu decision to bomb qatar not prove beyond doubt that he do not care about the hostage that they be collateral damage as much as any palestinian child and that israel be now rogue state must not the uk put in place severe sanction against this rogue state to prove our word be glad to be answer question from my hon friend again as he have be persistent advocate on these matter there be deep concern about event the attack in jerusalem be horrific as say to the hon member for harrow east bob blackman the development in the west bank both over the summer and before be deeply concern and be grateful to my hon friend for raise they we will continue to keep all measure under review as he would expect we have take far reach action with three wave of sanction target in particular on violent settler we will continue to keep such option under review as development proceed let we look at the fact behind israel strike we have bunch of terrorist who have be sit in the safety of qatar for year organising and financing act of terror include the mass murder of civilian in israel this week and boast about their involvement in it be it not an advance that those people be eliminate and it be make clear to they that they will face the consequence of the terror that they organise be show they that they will be pursue and punish and that they will not win not more likely to drive they to the peace table than to continue their act of terror we have condemn the strike and do so again it violate qatar sovereignty obviously the question of the fact of the strike will now be contest and as say early the qatari government be release those fact as they conduct full investigation regardless of anybody else there be qatari official kill in the strike and it be violation of qatar sovereignty for that reason alone it be worth condemn what security information be now share with israel be the information collect by the more than royal air force flight over gaza be use to guide the israeli bombardment of building in gaza city and other place be we still continue security co operation with country that have bomb almost every neighbouring state over the past year for reason the house will understand will not give lengthy commentary on security and intelligence matter but can confirm to the right hon gentleman that we do not provide any information to aid in target strike in gaza in the way that he describe as seasoned diplomat do the minister recognise that there be danger that we be hold israel to different standard when the americans reach out into pakistan to snuff out osama bin laden the architect of we be take they to the bar when israel reach out with precision decapitation strike on the leadership of hamas we want to take it to the bar of the international court the hon gentleman do make feel rather seasoned as be in pakistan at that time as say early the test in international law be self defence and imminence not every state agree on the threshold for those test but it be the expectation of the british government with all our partner and ally indeed with every state that they demonstrate how they be comply with international law regardless of who they be be pleased to have the minister confirmation that despite yesterday egregious action by israel qatar will continue its commitment to pursue the peace that we all long for in the middle east to that end the government have say that they would commit to recognise state of palestine before the united nations general assembly if israel fail to meet certain condition have israel fail to meet those condition and will the government recognise palestine as matter of urgency the prime minister will make determination on the question in advance of the high level week of the general assembly that be not long now the whole house can see the development of event in the region and indeed the language we set out in july do not wish to get ahead of the prime minister before he make that determination my lib dem colleague and have repeatedly call on the government to introduce further sanction on israel we call for sanction on ministers smotrich and ben gvir and now we call for sanction on prime minister netanyahu and his cabinet do the minister agree that those be the people who be responsible for create famine in gaza and continue the killing of innocent civilian as we discuss last week the circumstance of the famine in gaza be horrify and it be absolutely obvious that the restriction on aid into gaza for which the israeli government be responsible be contribute very significantly indeed to those circumstance the israeli government have raise methodological concern with the ipc judgment those concern arise from the fact that there be not free access into gaza we stand by the ipc and the judgment it have make it be clear that the restriction of the israeli government on which have be clear at the dispatch box innumerable time and have see for myself at the border be responsible for those circumstance we have have number of ceasefire historically each one be violate by the israeli government the recent attack in qatar be clear example that the israeli government be not interested in ceasefire they be interested in genocide take over the whole of the gaza strip and west bank we see that in their reaction and in what they say in the public arena none of the lever that we have speak about in this house seem to have have any impact it be like toothless tiger we say we be go to apply this pressure and that pressure and nothing seem to be do this blatant unlawful attack on qatar require punishment do the minister not think that the immediate unconditional recognition of state of palestine be form of punishment and would go far to ceasefire than what we be talk about set out in response to the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine the process by which we will make the determination on the recognition point that we set out in july that point be very soon the high level week of the un general assembly be just week away the hon gentleman will have an opportunity be sure to question and other member of the government after the prime minister have make his determination do not think it be right that we should think of recognition as punishment if that be indeed the determination that we make it will be reflection of our long stand commitment to two state solution it be unlikely in and of itself to ameliorate the horrifying famine and the many other source of agony that flow to the palestinian people at the moment that do not mean that if the prime minister make that determination it may not be the right thing to do but the house should not think that it will necessarily bring any immediate improvement in the humanitarian situation in gaza qatar have use its good office for diplomatic negotiation for many year taliban representative secretly arrive in qatar year ago and subsequently attend peace conference in japan germany and france if the uk and our ally let these strike by the netanyahu lead government go they could be precedent for strike on other intermediary how be the government encourage our ally to introduce sanction on member of the far right israeli government have set out the consultation with our partner that will be happen today and be sure over come day the hon gentleman be right about the role of qatar over the year include in the taliban talk that take place there for some time and we have discuss already the question under international law about state strike other state in respect of sanction the minister will be aware that ask the then foreign secretary last week whether he would make sure that the uk have no involvement in the propose elbit contract either commercial or governmental that there be absolutely no use of the akrotiri air base in cyprus to the advantage of the israeli military and that there be absolutely no trade with the illegal settlement in the west bank can the minister confirm that the position remain the same follow the change of guard and that he will make sure it be follow through can confirm that the british government position remain as set out by the then foreign secretary last week join the house in its condemnation of the attack against civilian in jerusalem this week the impunity and military support afford to the state of israel over the past year and as it carry out the ongoing genocide in gaza and wide palestine have embolden its leader to launch assault in lebanon syria iran tunisia and now qatar kill thousand and force million to flee their home across the region be the minister not concerned that the british government continue support for rogue state perpetrate repeat violation of international law will lead to israel invade other country and undermine the uk security and credibility on the world stage do he agree that qatar have right to defend itself against this unprovoked illegal attack have set out our position in relation to whole range of israeli government action with which we disagree so be not sure would characterise our position in the way that the hon gentleman do have already set out our position on the relevant question of international law as far as be able can the minister confirm whether the attorney general will publish any advice that he or the government have receive on whether there have be breach of international law during the conflict in gaza that be more properly question for the attorney general think there have be some correspondence between he and his shadow but will revert to the attorney general late position on that question we have witness the israeli army massacre over people in gaza of whom be child the blood soak tentacle of the israeli army be now reach close to home especially in my case yesterday afternoon in doha my niece and her daughter be have lovely time together in library when the israeli army which this government fail to condemn for commit genocide drop bomb two or three street away from where they be the building shake and there be smoke everywhere my niece baby be still ask will it happen again so ask the minister will it happen again and what will this government do beyond say empty word when will we completely stop every single arm sale to israel impose economic political and social sanction and use all our power to get desperately need aid into gaza think have answer question on arm and sanction already in this session want to be clear we have condemn these strike and we do not want to see they again we be discuss these matter with our ally include we hope at the un security council this evening we will no doubt keep the house update on how those discussion go thank the minister for his very confident reply to the question and wish he well in his role these thing be never easy but the minister have do quite well the loss of life be of course regrettable in all situation this house must also condemn the callous murder of six innocent israelis include two rabbi and woman on the day before the attack in doha do the minister acknowledge that the uk must share pertinent intelligence with israel to ensure that target attack take place so that israel can cut the head off the hamas snake then and only then can there be peace for israel and gaza the hamas threat have be target and eradicate effectively thank the hon member for his kind word have set out clearly our absolute opposition to hamas on whole range of question but have also set out our understanding of international law why we condemn these strike and why we do not want to see they repeat russian drones violation of polish airspace urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make statement on the violation of poland airspace by russian drone welcome to your new job minister this be my first uq in the house and this be very serious topic to be discuss last night as we know poland shoot down multiple russian drone that have enter its airspace poland state that the drone be part of co ordinate russian attack on target across the border in ukraine the ukrainians be subject to barbaric attack every evening but this be an unprecedented violation of polish airspace indeed it go deep enough for warsaw airport to be close thank the polish and nato air defence force for respond rapidly and effectively to protect the alliance the area affect be region on the border of belarus and ukraine poland temporarily close its airspace and some airport and emergency alarm be issue for the region affect but airspace and most airport have now reopen russia action be absolutely and utterly reckless unprecedented and dangerous this serve to remind we of president putin blatant disregard for peace and of the constant bombardment that innocent ukrainians face every day in response poland prime minister donald tusk have announce that poland will invoke nato article which allow any ally to consult other when it believe that its territorial integrity political independence or security be threaten the prime minister have be in contact with prime minister tusk to make absolutely crystal clear the uk support for poland and that we will stand firm in our support for ukraine the defence secretary be meet counterpart today and will discuss what additional support we can provide include to reinforce ukraine and strengthen nato we stand in full solidarity with our ally poland we condemn this action we say to russia your aggression only strengthen the unity of nato nation it only strengthen our solidarity in stand with and beside ukraine it remind we that secure europe need strong ukraine with our ally and partner and through uk leadership of the coalition of the willing we will continue to ramp up the pressure on putin until there be just and last peace thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question may begin by express our total solidarity with the people of poland the opposition stand shoulder to shoulder with the government in support of our strong nato ally poland be great nation and great friend of britain our thought be with its people and we fully support all effort to rally our nato ally and ensure that poland invocation of article be respond to as swiftly as possible this be an unprecedented violation of polish and nato airspace that must be meet with total condemnation and robust response so must the late bombing of ukraine as russia continue to target civilian and conduct an unprovoked war of aggression without any regard for human life what if any judgment have the government be able to form of the precise motivation for this drone incursion if this be design to test nato resolve will putin not have already see how strong the resolve be to stand united against this aggression we understand that dutch be directly involve in support the polish military response and that fighter from other nato nation may have be scramble be it not sober that the from the netherlands follow we in rotate air support for poland so if this incursion have occur just week ago raf typhoons could have be directly involve on the specific of our joint nato response can the minister say more about what invoke article mean in practical term for the uk and our ally and what the next step be importantly what discussion have the uk government have with our us counterpart on these development above all give that this incident involve the use of lethal russian drone against fellow nato member what further step be the government now consider in order to constrain russia ability to threaten our close ally and to provide further support to poland finally in the light of the norway deal the minister will be aware that one of the large ever defence export deal conclude under the previous government be the sale of ground base air defence to poland in the week of dsei do that not show why such industrial collaboration with our ally be important not just economically but when it come to defend our close ally there be those who may question the nature of the russian threat or the need to significantly increase defence spending but these event should leave nobody in any doubt that the threat extend beyond ukraine and that we must therefore continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with ukraine poland and all our nato ally thank the hon member for his response and his bipartisan support on this really serious issue what be nato article for clarity article be consultation mechanism if an ally perceive that its territorial integrity political independence or security be threaten it can invoke article that be what poland have do discussion will then take place in the north atlantic council nato senior political body in which the uk will of course be involve mention the status of the attack poland state that the drone be part of co ordinate russian attack on target across the border in ukraine but that do not in any way shape or form excuse those attack they be an unprecedented violation of polish airspace on an unprecedented scale agree that our industrial collaboration with our ally and partner be essential as we and nato move forward and as our partner and ally relationship move forward to make sure that we be prepare in every way for an escalation or an existential crisis should it come in our response to ukraine we be do huge amount to lead our ally and partner as we speak the secretary of state for defence be with the talk about the coalition of the willing and he have talk to polish representative already we be lead the way in that coalition on its formation structure and how it will deploy should it need to if peace ever come to ukraine welcome the minister statement be this not another example that what russia really believe in be the complete annihilation of ukraine it do not care what collateral damage it do elsewhere believe that send drone across into poland be deliberate move by the russians welcome the response from poland and nato but do we not need to talk about ramp up industrial co operation for ukraine so that it get more and well munition and equipment more quickly and ramp up sanction with the budget come up we need to consider how we ramp up defence expenditure and far increase it beyond the recent target set thank my hon friend for his question and for his support for defence completely agree that the ukrainians be undergo serious violation of international law by barbaric and reckless leader in russia they be experience bombing drone attack ballistic missile attack which can not be hear subterfuge sabotage hostage taking and the huge large scale kidnapping of child air raid go off every night in ukraine in way that be reminiscent of world war two the wail of those siren alone will have psychological impact that will last long after any war finish why be this happen today it be because of putin barbaric unprovoked and illegal invasion of sovereign state we must continue to do the maximum to support ukraine and encourage its ally and partner we have do significant amount the house may recall that at the last ukraine defence contact group meeting we launch day drive to deliver more for ukraine fifty day on we have million round of munition artillery shell rocket and missile uncrewed system vehicle and electronic warfare and defence system on top of that we have million plan to provide air defence missile and finally million to provide air defence and artillery we be at the leading edge and have be for long time in support ukraine and we will continue to be long into the future call the liberal democrat spokesperson overnight poland face down an unprecedented violation of nato and polish airspace the late act of belligerence by russian dictator hell bent on recreate the russian empire this be stark reminder that history can not repeat itself the drone be part of russia late large scale assault on ukraine an assault in which drone be launch we thank the polish air force for protect the nato alliance and we stand with our ally no matter what president trump believe it be clear that putin be not stop he be not consider peace he be test nato limit line have be cross and we must collectively stand up to this aggression the government must take tangible action will the minister take forward the liberal democrat proposal to end the import of product use russian oil that have be process in third country stop uk company ship or insure russian liquefy natural gas and push for further cut to the oil price cap as tusk say this morning action speak louder than word the strong action we could take would be to seize the frozen russian asset across the uk will the minister commit to do that today thank the hon member for her contribution and for her support for defence she bring up really valuable point those who do not read history be doom to repeat it this be an unprecedented attack and an unprecedented violation of polish airspace we be work exceptionally hard with the polish to ensure that they and indeed our broad nato alliance have everything they need we already have significant sanction on russia there be work go on between the ministry of defence and the foreign commonwealth and development office look at how we can move those forward we will update the house in due course the appalling attack on ukraine and the violation of polish airspace yesterday simply highlight the increase and devastating use of drone in modern warfare have be contact by hartlepool constituent today express their anxiety and fear about what this might mean for our shore will the minister share the government plan to ensure that the uk drone and air defence capability meet the challenge of the change we be see in modern warfare thank my hon friend for his contribution he will know that be passionate about the need for we to increase our uncrewed system portfolio we have already commit in the defence industrial strategy and the strategic defence review to create an uncrewed centre of excellence that will help we to rewrite our doctrine and concept but also to integrate drone back into the military and ensure we have high low mix of fifth and sixth generation capability mass with low end uncrewed system every night night on night we have see an increase in drone attack on kyiv and other city from dnipro to zaporizhzhia and kherson and back again they be increase on an unprecedented scale some could argue that putin have be embolden recently but we be see an increase and we must do everything we possibly can to support the ukrainians commend the hon gentleman statement on our support for poland of course we have to support poland it be quite right that we should do so may return the hon gentleman to the main issue here which be russia intense bombing attack on ukraine recently come back from ukraine every night in kyiv lviv and other town people be be kill by this brute this be just an example of what be go on across the border on great scale this question remain for we have the government really make overture to the us president to say that the time be over for constant statement that say that we may do something we will do something and we will have sanction surely we now have to get the us to massively up the level of sanction that be what russia fear also european nation must be tell that they can not buy any more oil or gas that have be run through india or wherever that have to stop we have to make that work and we have to make sure that at the end of it all russia pay penalty right now and understand that will the british government please take the opportunity when the us president come over to say enough be enough please act and get this thing do thank the right hon member for his contribution and for his stalwart support on both defence and foreign affair our sanction programme have be pretty impressive to date can almost guarantee that when the us president come over there will be discussion on whole range of topic and that ukraine will probably be central alongside other issue within the uk impose penalty on russia be exactly what we have do in bipartisan way when the previous government be in office we lead the way on equipment go into ukraine we be continue to do that we have see huge uplift in the amount of resource go to ukraine financially and in term of weapon but also importantly in industrial build across europe that be not just in the uk but across all our european nation industry be require to maintain the pace and scale of the conflict which think have catch people out in the past follow on from the question by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith the reality be that putin have become emboldened since he meet president trump no long be there pressure for an immediate ceasefire only that we get to long term distant peace arrangement that as we all know will never happen the threat of further sanction from the us which putin be really frightened about have now apparently be take off the table when president trump come over here will my hon friend engage with our colleague in the foreign commonwealth and development office to try to put pressure on president trump to say we should recognise that the one thing that can be do to get president putin to back off and properly look at ceasefire be further sanction from the us to marry those put on by ourselves and our european colleague thank my hon friend for his contribution he be the third person to speak about sanction it absolutely have sink in and we will discuss it with our cross government colleague in due course would not underestimate the ability of the americans to act it be down to the american people and the american government to decide but would not underestimate that ability over the short medium or long term one of the key point of have us visit of such level be that it will give we the opportunity to discuss these issue in person and to really highlight what be important to we it speak to the importance of be in the tent to have those discussion for we as government and for everybody and every party in this wonderful place let we be clear this be no accidental violation of poland or nato airspace as nato member one could argue that it be actually violation of our own airspace be it not clear that russia be test nato resolve and that putin will ruthlessly exploit any real or perceive diplomatic military or political weakness get the minister point on calibration and proportionality but what do robust response mean follow on from an early question from the labour benches give that there be many russian ship in the english channel and around these isle from which drone could easily be deploy what about uk air defence the intelligence agency will be able to provide the good analysis of this attack so will not jump to conclusion on the intention behind it it have however be clear for several year now that there have be consistent testing of nato as whole whether that be cyber attack from hostile state in the past two year or the use of chemical or radiological weapon on uk soil to name just two of the litany of incident fully support the ukrainian strategy of fight and talk to keep the pressure on the russians to ensure that they come to the table fully support us lead peace process but the ukrainians view must be central and they must lead it from their perspective be glad to hear the minister resolve and indeed the whole house united condemnation and shock at these outrageous attack the uk must stand firm with nato with poland and with europe and we must increase our support for ukraine and its neighbour include estonia latvia finland lithuania and elsewhere follow on from the previous question what step have the minister take to review our defence in the light of recent event first we be fully in support of our nato ally and of course our baltic ally the last time article be invoke be when it be invoke by many of our baltic ally on the invasion of ukraine it have be invoke eight time with the most recent instance obviously be this morning be not go to give the detail of our air defence operational capability here but we do have suite of capability if member read the strategic defence review and the defence industrial strategy they will see that there be large proportion on industrial rebuild here in the uk and support our ally with joint venture and partnership to re establish the military industrial base of europe in these unprecedented time and central to that will be air defence understand that ukraine hold approximately billion in frozen russian asset press report today suggest that there be level of flexibility in the stance on release they as long as there be some legal guarantee from the european union around the risk that may be face be the government support the european union to unlock this opportunity which could help to support effort in ukraine we support the ability to get resource into ukraine in any way shape or form will raise that specific matter with the home office and our cross government colleague and get back to the hon gentleman on the answer our constituent with link to poland will understandably be terrify by last night development but they will also be reassure that the polish people like the ukrainian people do not stand alone nato supreme headquarters confirm that last night mission involve not just polish air defence but dutch german patriot battery and italian early warning aircraft the eu high representative have talk about increase its involvement in the east shield project which we be already part of will the minister update this house on his conversation with our european counterpart about last night and on what more we will do to stand with the polish and ukrainian people first would like to thank both polish and nato air defence force for disrupt the attack that take place yesterday as member will know the defence secretary be with the at the moment and they have discuss this specific issue look forward we be work towards bilateral defence and security treaty with the polish recently visit the royal air force in poland during its recent deployment in nato enhance air policing mission during op chessman where see at first hand raf typhoons scramble to intercept russian signal intelligence coot poland feel the threat from russia much more keenly than think we appreciate in this house in the drone debate last week raise with the minister that we have paucity of counter uas capability while we obviously do not face the risk that poland do or have plan such as the east shield what step be the government take to ensure that our own territory critical infrastructure and military basis both here and overseas possess an organic capability that can be bring to bear we absolutely need to have an integrate air defence system with our european and nato ally and we must look after our critical national infrastructure that be why the sdr and the defence industrial strategy really have focus on industrial rebuild part of which be air defence we be also work with our ukrainian ally to learn good practice from they and pull that back to the uk meur ra madam deputy speaker not only be the shocking escalation of hostility by russia deliberately provocative act but it threaten all nato state and an iron clothe response be now require will the ministry with our nato partner be unequivocal in remind russian and belarusian counterpart of nato article and that an attack on poland be an attack on all nato partner include the united kingdom we will absolutely do that it be worth note that article and be not link nevertheless we will be go all out to remind all our ally and partner of the severity of the situation and of course the continue barbaric nature of putin invasion of ukraine will the minister outline what the government be do to highlight and explain to the citizen of our country what our obligation be to poland lithuania latvia estonia and all our nato ally under article and the role play by the joint expeditionary force with the baltic three the nordic five the netherlands and the uk the hon member raise really important point one of the big impact on the cost of live across this country be the war between ukraine and russia it be have second and third order effect that be affect everyone in the country it be really worthwhile remind our citizen of that and that if article be invoke we will have an obligation to defend that be so important when we look at our foreign policy and where we need to prioritise our resource the uk and poland have very close defence and security relationship poland be of course one of our most important european ally what plan do the minister have to strengthen this relationship and those with our other ally do he agree that we need to do all we can to calmly make clear to our population that the defence of the free world be be test and that we need collectively to be resolute in our response in year in the military have never see it as fractious or fragile as it be particularly today it be on all of we to make sure that the population understand the risk to the geopolitical environment that surround we and give we the standard of living we have in the uk we be work towards bilateral defence and security treaty with poland which will deepen tie and an industrial partnership believe that this be deliberate attack by putin to test the resolve and resource of nato and that we will see more in the come week month and year russia be very quick to put out disinformation by pump the airwave in the cyber space can we ensure that we be provide all resource to counter disinformation which be battlespace on its own and that we be ramp up against the current threat that russia be push out across nato country thank the hon and gallant member for his contribution and support for defence affair some can be quite disparage about it but it be worth remind ourselves that nato be the most effective military alliance ever see in history its number and capacity far outweigh some of our adversary one area it have fantastic command capability in be information operation and as member of parliament we can all play our part in that by take away the message we have hear today and make sure that our nation and constituent understand the second and third order effect of potential escalation for many year banbury have be home to thousand of polish citizen who will understandably be very concerned at event over the past hour can the minister reassure they not only that our relationship with poland be steadfast but that this government be take step to strengthen it in spite of putin putin action pull nato together and forge alliance and partnership and they focus we in on the barbaric nature of russia aggression have work with the polish in the past and we have great relationship with they they be increase defence spending and there be industrial opportunity there we also have great cultural tie with poland the polish serve in the air force in the second world war and all the way through to the latter year we be fully behind poland our ally and partner congratulate and salute the brave aircrew who intercept this flagrant breach not just of poland airspace but of the international rule base order do not believe for one second that this be some inadvertent mistake this be classic russian playbook russia be probe nato in that attack and will continue to probe until it come up against the resistance that it deem worthy of change in policy russia respond in two way one be strength and the other be weakness and if it see weakness it will continue can the minister help the house understand what the robust response to this flagrant attack will look like as mention early when these incident take place it forge and focus the alliance and take away any friction because we create unity of effort so it be mismove by putin to think that it do not make nato strong if we be look at deterrence whether by punishment or denial we see that ukraine be hold back one of the big military in the world and that there have be million casualty and that the denial be great nato unity and focus on the aggressor that be putin this attack by vladimir putin on nato member that have be leader in resist russian aggression and supply ukraine be clear escalation and an attempt as other have say to probe nato defence and intimidate the alliance can the minister assure that the uk and nato will not be intimidate and that the government be consider robust military option to stand up to this bully in moscow close to home can he assure that the attack will confirm the urgency to escalate and accelerate our development of the type destroyer and the future air defence system so that our country be fully protect in the future thank my hon friend for his contribution to defence he be stalwart champion of ukraine and defence as whole have never be intimidate in my life we as country will not be intimidate and neither will nato reiterate that our defence industrial strategy be absolutely critical give weapon to ukraine be one thing but build industrial capacity to generate mass be how country win war should they be catch up in one that be why the strategic defence review first page be all about industry in the minister excellent response he talk about the geopolitical situation during my time in office see more and more co operation between russia china north korea and iran he talk about the emboldening of putin do he share my concern that the recent show of unity at the shanghai co operation organisation summit in china may well have embolden putin that should be wake up call for all western democracy to stand together in defence of their mutual value absolutely agree that we must stand together for those mutual value whether that be the right to independence to self determination to collective security and so on yes putin may feel emboldened but would argue that his action today have strengthen and galvanise the alliance can guarantee that the discussion with the and nato that take place will be absolutely focused on russia and that drive economic growth and spending on defence so would argue that it be not just shot across the border but shot in the foot from putin rise mr naish you seem to have bounce around every seat on the back bench be you finally comfortable and ready to ask question yes madam deputy speaker apologise for move around poland be one of our close european ally with long share history in my region of the east midland that be embody in our large british polish community whose root go back over year in the light of last night attack what be the government plan to strengthen our deterrence on nato north eastern flank poland be one of our strong ally and interestingly be build one of the big land force in europe its recapitalisation programme be of significant scale because it have large land border from my perspective work with poland towards bilateral defence and security treaty be absolutely essential due to the industrial and bilateral benefit it will bring we stand side by side with the polish no question no doubt and we stand absolutely at the centre of nato defence policy my constituency also have large polish community who have be alarm to see russian drone violate polish airspace we all know that if ukraine be to fall to putin aggression poland would be next in his sight how be the government intend to support poland in defend its sovereignty and what step be the government take to strengthen our own security thank the hon member for her contribution and thank the polish member of her constituency for support poland during these time we have multitude of different capability in poland that have rotate through for example as mention by the opposition our nato enhance joint air policing stop just couple of month ago and be rotate we also have light cavalry squadron there work with the polish and the us poland be also central pillar of the coalition of the willing as we move forward everything be do by with and alongside our polish ally join the minister in his condemnation of this clear escalation against our polish ally he will know that my constituency have large polish diaspora who be extremely concerned about their country and fearful of further russian attack what assurance can he give the polish community in my constituency and across the country and what work will he do across government to support the polish community at this difficult time the assurance we can give be that nato be the most effective military alliance of all time and poland the uk and our ally sit central to that the centrality of the alliance be the good form of deterrence and therefore the good form of assurance to both my hon friend constituent and people across the whole nato alliance and it be central to our defence policy as we move forward president zelensky have be consistent in his argument that the invasion of his country be just the beginning and that we be all in the crosshair he make that argument forcefully and famously in the oval office do the minister not agree that what have happen with this violation of polish and nato airspace completely vindicate president zelensky have meet president zelensky several time and be keen observer of the conflict as it have move forward million russian casualty and km dead zone on the frontline that would reflect any battlefront or frontline from the first world war to the second world war what be happen there be absolutely atrocious be always really clear deterrence yes and peace yes but appeasement no like the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty be part of the excellent armed force parliamentary scheme visit to operation chessman in poland early this year also see the scrambling of our raf typhoon jet and it go up in the sky to check out suspicious russian air activity that be surprise to but from speak to our raf personnel find that it be quite common at the time from speak later on to our polish counterpart know that that be what they be face in poland the public there be well aware of the russian threat here in this country be not so sure that the british public get quite how serious the threat be in poland they be on the physical frontline and people in ukraine be pay the horrible price of putin aggression will the minister reassure the house and the public that the government be do all they can to deal with the russian threat of cyber attack and grey warfare on europe and indeed this country my hon friend bring we to really important point we must not alarm the nation and we must not scare the nation but we must be honest with the nation as to the risk and threat pose towards our defence and indeed the citizen of this country we need to be clear about that that be why in the strategic defence review we see talk of military intelligence and the review that be go on because if we be to explain to the population why we be spend more on defence we must ensure that it be relate to those threat we will explain it clearly the sdr have state it and then we will double down on investment in the defence industry to ensure that we can provide the assurance that we can contribute to nato in an absolutely above and beyond meaningful way in november the hon member for widnes and halewood derek twigg and for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan and be in ukraine with the defence committee when there be an onslaught of rocket fire into that country one of which errantly fall into poland and kill two polish national on that day poland consider trigger article and today it have clearly do so in the intervene period of almost three year there have be grow reluctance to equip ukraine to defend its sky and importantly to do so from the sky so while this article meeting of member state will consider how we protect the sky of nato will the minister confirm that he be willing to extend that conversation to how we appropriately and effectively defend the sky of ukraine that be great question from the right hon member who know be stalwart supporter of defence as we move forward with the strategic defence review and defence industrial strategy we must ensure that we revitalise our defence industry so that we produce that important mix of high end system high end air defence and low end system that can be use in an economic mismatch between cheap and high end system get that mix right be complicated but in the defence industrial strategy and the sdr we be intent on ensure that our british military be equip with that high and low end mix of fifth and sixth generation and mass produce hardware in due course entirely agree with the minister when he say that nato be the most successful defensive alliance in history but the reason for that be that until recently the commitment of the united states to nato be never in question it be in question now because of the nature of the incumbent of the white house president putin either have some sort of hold over donald trump about which we do not know or he successfully flatter he when president trump be in the country can we point out to he in the strong possible term that this response by russia couple of week after roll out the red carpet for the killer in the kremlin show nothing but disrespect to the white house and its occupant thank the right hon member for his continued support for defence the united states have be really clear that it would like european nation to spend more on defence it obviously have multitude of different threat that it have to deal with when the us president come to the uk we be in the tent we be go to sit down with he and discuss these issue in detail put on record my respect for the bravery of the ukrainian child vladyslav valeriia and roman who come to parliament last night to share their story as survivor of putin war of aggression putin action over polish airspace last night be deliberate move to test nato reaction and the response must match the moment will the minister please push for cohesive plan to seize frozen russian asset and funnel they to the humanitarian mission to support ukraine incredible and inspiring future generation my heart go out to those child and to everyone in ukraine who be go through this they have be go through this for several year guarantee the hon member that discussion be ongoing now about how we can push the system more to pressure russia into come towards the peace table the minister agree with my hon friend the member for south suffolk james cartlidge that industrial collaboration between the uk and poland be an important part of our relationship key part of that be primarily focus on ground base air defence and these event surely underline why that be critical to we and our ally will he tell we what progress there have be on the joint uk poland future common missile programme to create long range ground base air defence for both nation do not have the detail on that industrial partnership can write back to the hon member in due course air defence be critical as be make sure that we can secure our ocean subsurface and of course land it be good that there be universal recognition across the house that last night be an attack not just on polish airspace but on nato airspace in term of the response may bring the minister back to sanction we have sanction on russian crude oil although sadly there be at least one nato country that do not implement they with regard to refined oil be we in this country not import considerable quantity of russian crude oil that have be refine down in the recent trade deal with india be there any attempt to put any restraint on that on the latter point will engage with my colleague across government and look into the detail put pressure on russia be absolutely our priority to bring it to the peace table in due course and we be work exceptionally hard to deliver that the minister be quite right to describe this violation of polish airspace as unprecedented but be sure he would agree that it be not isolate in fact it represent the late escalation in russia campaign of attack on central and eastern european nato ally just last year shopping centre in vilnius and warsaw be set on fire and the leader of those country point the finger firmly at russian military intelligence just last week jet carry the president of the european commission suffer cyber attack that be initiate by russia russia be clearly not deter by the current measure in place will the minister outline what we can do as lead military power in europe and in nato to enhance and reinforce the capability of our nato ally who be on the frontline of the confrontation with russia we be do that right now the defence industrial strategy the strategic defence review and the industrial rebuild will ensure that we have the right arm and enough of they to reinforce the deterrence and if call to to fight and win russian drone over poland suggest that putin be test nato resolve to support its member will the minister push the prime minister to urge president trump and the member of the to produce cohesive plan to seize the billion in frozen russian asset hold in their country and funnel that money to the frontline in ukraine that money would transform zelensky effort to repel putin illegal war machine will the government commit to do that the united states be one of our most critical ally and when the president of the united states visit the uk there will be multitude of discussion particularly focus on ukraine european security and of course nato do the minister agree that we need to take strong step to deter putin that start with seize billion in frozen russian asset across the uk and use they to support ukraine in its fight against russia because putin have show that if we give he an inch he will take mile as mention previously we have to continue to push and pressure putin to bring he to the peace table through whole suite of different capability from provide arm to ukraine all the way through to sanction we will continue to do that the russian drone over poland be track by polish aircraft but also by dutch aircraft station in poland that remind we that four year ago putin seek roll back in nato deployment from central and eastern europe in russia outrageously demand that nato ally deploy no force in country that join the alliance after do the minister agree that have the us accede to those demand we might be see devastating consequence in poland today it be so interesting when we talk about deterrence there be huge multinational nato exercise that take place every year be the chief of staff of the carrier strike group in on the date the hon gentleman mention that be call cold response which be the big naval exercise to the high north in several year we demonstrate to russia on multiple different occasion how effective the nato alliance be and if call to how it will fight and win may give my thank to the polish and dutch air crew who be involve in the defence of poland airspace last night the seat in their jet may have be manufacture and test in my constituency at chalgrove airfield but that airfield could be demolish thank to proposal by homes england to build new town there will the minister meet to urgently address that threat to uk national security yes congratulate the hon and gallant minister on his elevation which be well deserve an on the comment he make about not be intimidate he speak for we all in that regard indeed almost feel poster campaign come about stand firm the incursion of russian drone into nato member nation be slap in the face for the very idea of nato and must be deal with effectively and immediately what collective discussion will be hold within nato to determine robust response to the testing of our border and the resolution to stand fast against russia thank the hon member for his question and his support for defence discussion in the be ongoing as we speak and the nac have sit and will continue

attention deficit hyperactivity disorder mean that concentrating be nightmare with the slight thing pull my attention away believe that school be not for fall behind be bully and certainly act out be not alone in that since start campaign have hear from so many people who struggle from constituent to celebrity such as jamie oliver who be great advocate in this area wish could share they all today but we would be here for many day around one in seven people in the uk have what we might call neurodivergence it be non medical umbrella term describe the way people brain may develop or work differently from the norm in some way we be all neurodivergent to great or less extent neurodivergence be not weakness condition or flaw want to make that crystal clear in other way it be superpower and you can do anything you want with the right support definitely have with what have do today we be problem solver critical thinker and fantastic creator but with those strength come challenge such as reading writing social skill or math that do not mean there be anything wrong with we it just mean that we learn and understand thing differently and we might need to be support in different way from other be lucky at school because be identify and get the support need that be why be stand here today that support give the confidence to fight for what believe in get into politic and into this place be certainly not on my agenda at school but feel that have to do all can to make sure that everyone in community such as yeovil and beyond get the help that have in school or well despite all the progress that our country have make in recognise and empower neurodiverse people and despite our amazing educator work their sock off believe they do thing seem to have get bad in place such as somerset since be at school our school be under resource under support and local authority be totally underfunded we have the phonic screener but this test do not cover all the area that neurodiverse people may struggle and need support with such as attention control or working memory evidence also suggest that neurodiverse child can just memorise the word for the test mean that their actual need may be overlook that be one of their superpower even when child need be identify there be no proper dedicated special educational need and disability training in initial teacher training or continuous professional development programme nor be it there for teach assistant our overworked teaching staff be pretty much just leave to get on with it themselves and that be not good enough some school manage fantastically particularly when they be properly fund but other be struggle in some way this be another of those postcode lottery we hear so much about our child their family and our teacher deserve well that be why be introduce this bill today member will be pleased to know that it be not complicated in fact the idea behind it be fairly simple it be about get the government to use their resource and knowledge to bring everyone together to act so that we can create system to well identify neurodivergence and support child early on what be propose can be break down into three part first we need to define what we be introduce universal screening and teach training on this before the legislation can come into effect the secretary of state must lay report before the house that define neurodivergence secondly we need programme of universal screening for neurodivergence in primary school age child this would preferably be light touch teacher lead process as have say we all sit on the spectrum of neurodivergence in some way no matter what other say so the screening should not be about label but about create profile of strength and weakness this will help teacher to identify where all their pupil sit on the spectrum of neurodivergence and the level of support they need from in classroom adjustment to more formal referral finally we need proper teacher training the secretary of state must produce statutory guidance on training for teacher on neurodivergence in initial teacher training and in continuous professional development this should be for all teaching staff this training should provide teaching staff with clear understanding of neurodivergence knowledge of how it present differently in different people and the tool and resource to support their pupil do not want this bill to be about force label on young people that will not help again it be about help teacher to identify all their pupil strength and weakness the government will be pleased to know that it be not about force costly screener on school either while have not set out preference the universal classroom have work with teacher to create universal screener that will be free so this will not break the bank most importantly this be not about put more burden on to our fantastic teacher personally believe that teacher do far too much for far too little pay support or thank urge the government to look at the national education union list of admin task that teacher should not be do this bill be about empower teacher to do what they sign up for and care deeply about namely educate and support all their pupil to go back to the universal classroom screener it only take five to minute per pupil with the profile from screener like that and with well training all our teacher will have the confidence to make the right adjustment for each child in their class even small thing such as different paper extra time or time out card can make life change difference know this only too well what be propose today be no silver bullet it must go alongside other change in education if the government would rather take on these measure in their upcoming white paper or in some other legislation fine do not really care all that matter be that we get on with it we have have enough debating and enough promising let bring everyone together roll up our sleeve and take the next step to make education inclusive and accessible for every child question put and agree to order that adam dance tessa munt ed davey munira wilson james maccleary freddie van mierlo ian roome ann davy clive

quite right of course be not suggest that bus service should be only for profit he will know that essex county council have an enhance partnership agreement it have relationship with for profit provider but have negotiate that it will pay extra for social journey he will also note that essex have have more growth in its passenger number than any of the franchise operation in particular it have have more passenger growth than the bee network in greater manchester the organisation that the bill largely seek to replicate the bill have deep suspicion of the profit motive and focus on process ignore what the real purpose of the legislation should be the house of lords identify this lacuna in the drafting and rectify it with purpose clause which be clause when the bill be consider in committee it say that the act should improve the performance accessibility and quality of bus passenger service in great britain that be not particularly high bar or particularly onerous because the secretary of state merely have to have regard to those objective would not have think that be particularly challenge for the government however it be too much for they and they remove that purpose clause in committee new clause which be in my name and that of the shadow secretary of state my right hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr holden seek to reinstate that very reasonable clause it would ensure that when we discuss the improvement of bus service at the front and centre of our mind be the performance accessibility and quality of bus service so that we put the passenger first this bill despite the explanation give by the minister moment ago remain weak on protection for the disabled the partially sight and the blind that be huge concern in committee there have be lot of concern about this in the disabled community concern particularly focus on float bus stop and bus stop with share use border note that the minister say that he be look at have guidance note on design and that there should be campaign to remind cyclist in particular of the highway code do not think that be good enough do not think design tweak could be make to float bus stop that would provide partially sight and blind user with the security that they richly deserve when use bus service an educational campaign to remind cyclist of their duty under the highway code would not do any harm and suggest that the government do it but it would not be the solution in its own right we have have warm word from the minister both in committee and today but we need action new clause would give the government six month to prepare proposal to prohibit the creation of new float bus stop the government appear to be deaf to the blind and not prepared to take effective action on this point the government be also be weak on protection for bus passenger more generally we want legislation that put bus user first both as regard accessibility which have mention and protection against antisocial behaviour we be not ask much we be just ask that the legislation afford bus user the same protection that rail passenger benefit from the government have an opportunity to support those objective and hope that the minister will acknowledge that that be the direction that they should take thank the hon gentleman for draw attention to the need to provide for disabled bus user my amendment would require local authority seek franchise to take people with special educational need into account and to consult they and the group that represent they do he agree with that proposal the hon lady will know from read the hansard of committee proceeding what time and effort the official opposition put into support the aspiration to have increase accessibility across disability and special educational need so be very supportive in principle of her amendment aim have address accessibility but what about price and increase bus usage we know from our experience of operate bus service over the past decade that price be one of the big factor affect patronage in the previous administration the conservatives put forward bus fare cap and it be enormously successful apart from anything else it be hugely popular but it also aid the recovery from covid and in get people back out and about it be particularly useful for young passenger it help to build their confidence and get they back on the road to recovery in the run up to the last election the continuation of the bus fare cap for the duration of this parliament be conservative manifesto commitment what be labour response to that its first act on come into power be to put the price up by from to to accompany that there be perverse claim that that be actually price cut one do not need to be an economist at the bank of england or even from the account department to work that one out experience of customer complaint would be enough to enable person to see that price rise from to be exactly that rise not cut tell you what kind of cut be unacceptable order in my constituency order please be seat should have to say order only once you just say the word you so let restart that intervention which should be short my apology madam deputy speaker do the hon gentleman agree that the only unacceptable cut be those make to bus by the conservative government in my constituency of bus be cut that do not take away from the overarching point that labour have increase bus fare by and describe it as price cut which be disingenuous in the extreme we need to understand the impact of labour price rise on ridership and in particular on social accessibility that understanding will inform behaviour and should inform good policy for the future but the government have their head in the sand amendment also in my name would require the secretary of state to conduct an assessment of the impact of end the bus fare cap on passenger ability to access socially necessary local service that proposal be initially insert in the other place with wide support from number of party but again the government decide to remove it in committee they need to own the consequence of their decision last year transport ministers need to find money for an unfunded pay rise of for aslef train driver where do they get the money their first choice be to go after bus passenger and their second be to go after pensioner the shadow minister talk lot about price but he be defend system in which my constituent must get three bus or more to get to their destination and pay individual fare on those bus under the integrated system propose in the bill we could have price cap like the one here in london why do he not support that principle be perfectly happy with that principle in fact it be conservative principle first introduce in we do not have to choose between one thing and another that be false analysis the pricing be political decision by this ministerial team who choose to increase price from to and that be vote for by all government members they make that political choice the choice between franchise scheme an enhanced partnership scheme or any other form of scheme have nothing to do with the primary political choice make by labour members to raise price for bus passenger to pay for unfunded union pay rise that be simply the fact political choice be make locally and nationally labour member talk about the past year but we conservative win control of lancashire county council in and increase the bus budget by we put on bus route that the labour party in lancashire have make the political decision to cut just as it choose to put up the price cap from to these be political choice my hon friend be entirely right refer the house to norfolk county council another conservative council and the one in which my constituency be base which have an enhance partnership with bus company that partnership have be more effective in drive bus ridership than the franchised process have be in manchester at least as enact by the mayor of manchester andy burnham will now deal with franchise more fully this bizarre draft legislation appear to have take good idea in principle and make it bad in practice the hon member for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier be quite right that the conservative government recognise in the potential for region base transport integration in principle mayoral combine authority have the scale resource and financial sophistication to take on the responsibility of create franchised scheme and would thereby have more control over the design of public transport in their area that be conservative innovation and support it under the legislation other local transport authority also have the ability to apply for franchise status if may loosely call it that however there be concern that small local authority would not have as many resource be they financial or top tier management resource to deal with and design such operation so critical safeguard be insert in that legislation require such authority should they wish to go down the franchise route to obtain the approval of the secretary of state for their plan it be sense check need safeguard because franchising expose local transport authority to huge commercial risk they be not just let contract and as with an enhanced partnership add bit extra on after negotiation with commercial operator they also become responsible for the design of the full bus map and timetable and have the result commercial liability of provide all the bus and driver authority can either pay bus company to operate for fee and so take no commercial risk the company just turn up and do what it be tell or expose themselves far by create municipal bus company and do everything themselves if that go wrong it can bankrupt local authority on the point about financial risk for local authority do my hon friend agree there be absolutely nothing in the bill that local authority such as mine the isle of wight council would possibly want to touch when it come to franchise for bus across my constituency the risk for small unitary authority be just far too great if there be any opportunity at all in this bill be not sure that there be it will apply only to large city council and metropolitan area my hon friend be quite right there be some good in the amendment come to amendment which would reinsert the secretary of state safeguard that would not prohibit small unitarie from apply or develop franchise model it be about the secretary of state have the ability to sense check the commercial ability of an organisation to take the very significant commercial risk that franchising bring with it there be another massive lacuna in the current drafting of the bill have expand franchising to any local authority no matter how small and whether district county or unitary the secretary of state would withdraw from any power to intervene if thing go wrong we recognise that there be increase commercial risk and that we will ask potentially small local authority to undertake wholly novel activity of which they have no experience at all but the secretary of state be say we wash our hand of this we do not want to have any power to intervene even when there be prolong failure of service to the public the hon gentleman suggest that the conservative position be to support combined authority be able to take on franchising yet the conservative tees valley mayor have flat out reject franchising power be proud that this government be bring forward this bill to make it easy for combined authority and other authority to bring in franchising in committee raise the example of my constituent norma templeman who have have to fight tooth and nail against the mayor and the bus company to get bus into her village of north skelton how can that be right think the hon member be in favour of devolution not all mayoral combine authority be the same if we have mayoral combine authority we want to have the right system for the area that the mayor represent if the mayor in teesside think that it be not the right thing for he back his decision let move on to new clause which would give the secretary of state the power to step in where there have be persistent failure to deliver service specify by contract it seem genuinely extraordinary that the government be say no to that add safeguard no cost be associate with it the new clause just say that where there be prolonged failure on the ground to deliver the service for whatever reason the secretary of state would have the power to step in and take on the management why would the government say that they do not need that backstop power they vote it down in committee and do not see they accept it today either all the amendment from the loyal opposition have common theme they put passenger first this bill be not really about passenger it be for big state more union and more union involvement and it be primarily against private business involvement understand that that be the ideology of labour members but the problem be that their ideology be demonstrably wrong in this instance and we see that in the bill without amendment it will damage our bus service and almost certainly damage our local transport authority particularly the small one if they be misguide enough to follow the encouragement of the government and go down this route above all be sorry to say that the bill will damage the chance of our passenger rise order will member please be seat before go to speech from back benchers want to be clear about where we be and what we be debate because there seem to be some confusion among colleague we be debate the remain stage of the bus services no bill and we be on report speech should relate to the amendment list on the amendment paper not the bill as whole so please check the amendment paper say that for back benchers who hope to contribute know that the next member know exactly what they be do call the chair of the transport committee you be absolutely right madam deputy speaker will not repeat what say on second reading except to say it be no surprise that our first stand alone inquiry in the transport committee be on bus in england outside of london that issue affect members in england from across the house and from all sort of constituency speak in support of two amendment that stand in the name of my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer myself and other amendment and new clause since second reading of the bus services no bill the transport committee have publish its bus connect community report which focus on potential solution to the long term decline in bus ridership in england outside london if the government seek the reversal of bus decline in england hope the minister will support our two amendment they add to the bill because they specifically seek to improve bus service in way that rely on future guidance may not they provide the context in which local transport authority can determine their specific bus provision merely devolve great control to local authority without any kind of overarch value base vision will not help in area that have no interest whatsoever in enhance and extend their service and could risk simply entrench inequality and decline new clause seek to ensure that local transport authority have duty to consider funding for service enhancement it be about whether when and how to use appropriate public funding to improve exist local bus service the local transport authority must have regard to six principle these be the potential for increase ridership the overall sustainability of the network the service improvement particularly the frequency of exist service extend operating hour improve the reliability of service or their integration with other mode of transport and extend the route of local service we know that progressive local authority be commit to enhance and expand the public transport in their area and they do that we have great example under labour mayor in greater manchester south yorkshire and the west midland have more people on more bus address the policy objective that they and we in labour seek to achieve such as address congestion air pollution carbon emission social and economic isolation and growth however fear that there be and that there could be more local authority that care little for those important objective which be central to this government value new clause would therefore bake in duty on local transport authority to consider use appropriate fund to improve bus service where it would grow ridership or improve the sustainability of the overall network it set out specific factor to be take into account when make such decision it would also enable bus user group and other to measure the intention of their local transport authority against those basic objective new clause come from the transport committee recommendation which say that the department should require local transport authority to consider use grant or fare box funding to enhance exist local bus service the need to improve local bus service while grow ridership be focal point of the evidence receive by our committee on that point do the hon lady accept that increase the fare cap from to be likely to reduce ridership whatever be contain in the new clause speak in the context of devolution within an overarching set of value will not go into the specific of what level bus fare should be but the overall ridership and the sustainability of the bus system be key objective know the minister will say that with devolution how that happen be up to the local transport authority return to the evidence we hear in committee as everybody here know bus remain the most used form of public transport yet the number of bus journey in england outside london have drop from billion in to billion in alongside the decline number of journey the need to improve service and increase ridership speak to the evidence receive by the committee about the impact on social isolation of lack of access to bus transport for the north tell the committee that in some million people across england face transport relate social exclusion and there be evidence that the problem be bad in town than in city the minister tell we that the government intend the bill to deliver service that be more affordable and reliable fast and well integrate however when press on whether people in england would see more bus to more place by the end of this parliament he say that that be certainly their intention and they be do everything possible to make it happen my contention be that without that be bake into the body of the bill there be risk that in many place there could be continued decline in bus service over time amendment to clause relate to socially necessary service it seek to insert in line of page after the word service along with description of the criterion or methodology use to determine which service be consider socially necessary it would be for the local transport authority to define that but in publicly visible way the amendment ask that local authority be require to produce transparent methodology for how they determine these socially necessary service the north west surrey bus users group make the argument to the committee that clear and consistently apply definition be essential for hold local authority accountable for maintain basic service level on loss make route it warn that in the absence of sufficient guidance to date some authority have to great or less extent abdicate their responsibility as result of such evidence the committee report recommend that the department should mandate local transport authority to publish their own transparent methodology for how they determine which bus service qualify as socially necessary to ensure public accountability hence the reason for this amendment north east surrey college of technology in my constituency be not accessible by bus leave student have to travel even far for their education because local bus service be simply not serve young people do the hon member agree that the bill must expand the definition of socially necessary local service to explicitly include school and college thank the hon member for her intervention which go to the heart of what be say it be not for this bill and this government to define whether or not college school and so forth should be include one would hope they would be but it be for the local authority to define their socially necessary service accord to the need in their area they should publish it and requirement to do so should be in the bill be pretty sure that the minister will say do worry chair of the select committee it be in the guidance my concern be that guidance be to some extent discretionary and can be change over time alex mayer and other would like to see the need to have definition and methodology for socially necessary service state in the bill order talk so highly of the select committee chair and say that she do everything right but think she mention colleague by their name not by their constituency can we try and stick to the etiquette have only be here and bit year will get use to it be refer to my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard apologise to the house and to you madam deputy speaker the bill as currently draft suggest that local transport authority merely define their socially necessary service that could mean service as they be now it do not take into account change in need new housing development might mean that loss make route become commercially viable the closure of major employer might mean that nearby housing lose viable bus service the bill allow for change but it should require local authority to have publicly available methodology on which user group community and resident can hold their local transport authority to account in addition to the point about socially necessary route company such as stagecoach cut the frequency of essential bus such as the no from exeter through to dawlish in my constituency and on down towards paignton that drive people away from the bus when the frequency go down from every minute to every minute it make the service unusable and take away the social value of the route the hon member be entirely correct our amendment would support local transport authority to grow their local bus network actively in response to demographic and economic change not just to manage the decline without the amendment particularly amendment the only requirement be for authority to list their current service while acknowledge the government rightful drive on devolution our committee would not want any local transport authority to walk away from the bill important objective to promote growth particularly in town across england to promote reliability and integration and to address social isolation inequality traffic congestion and pollution call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister and commend he for his constructive engagement throughout the passage of this bill on the floor of the house in committee and via the usual channel let make it clear from the outset that my party support the basic tenet of this bill the tories ideologically drive decision to deregulate the bus network in the and allow private operator to cream off the profitable route pay scant regard for many unprofitable mainly rural route serve small community which unless subsidise by an increasingly hard press local government be simply abandon since as direct consequence of their meddling the number of bus journey take in this country have fall by over billion decline of almost more than service have be cut or withdraw entirely in county such as shropshire and devon and across the country from cornwall to caithness entire village lose daily service and some area be reduce to one bus per week or none the bill represent bold attempt to reverse that decline if implement properly which will require more funding than currently on offer it could be transformational return control over local bus network to local community it would remove bureaucratic barrier to franchising enable local authority to design route timetable fare and brand that meet the need of community while allow profitable route to cross subsidise the unprofitable one rather than line the pocket of big business open up the possibility of more reliable integrated and affordable network which be so crucial for rural and deprived area that be currently face steep service decline liberal democrats want to ensure that this legislation fulfil its potential by empower local community protect vital route and drive the shift to greener fair transport we know how important bus be to people daily life if this bill be to succeed it must put passenger first that be why my hon friend and have table so many amendment acknowledge that many of they will not be select for vote but even at this late hour ask the minister please to cast his eye over they to see which one he might still accept it be worth highlight that no few than amendment be accept on report in the lords of they from the government and further six from lord blunkett which the government choose to support after some intensive behind the scene lobby by my lib dem colleague thank they for amendment that we re table in this place to address bus fare affordability disabled passenger access decarbonisation of the bus fleet and the protection of socially necessary route the bus service for langley vale in my constituency have woefully inadequate timetable and route that do not stop at the local hospital local bus route be simply not service my resident do my hon friend agree that the bill must tackle poor service and restore the fare cap reverse the devastating effect of route cut administer under the conservatives those be exactly the issue that the bill should and could address if the minister take the bold step we be ask of he today in its passage through the other place the bill be clearly strengthen through constructive engagement across the political divide the government have be willing to accept sensible proposal from their lordship so surely there can be no good reason why equally sensible amendment table here in the commons could not be adopt one such sensible proposal concern float bus stop badly design float bus stop be menace to the disabled old and infirm and in particular to the visually impaired which be why my party table new clause require the secretary of state not only to conduct review but to retrofit all exist float bus stop where necessary we support amendment to table by the hon member for battersea marsha de cordova and welcome the minister concession on the issue will address the three amendment that we continue to press with most conviction before turn to new clause table by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon our amendment address the scourge of headphone dodger which be not trivial matter many passenger feel unsafe or uncomfortable when other play loud content on their device without headphone oblivious of those around they that be not simply an irritation it cause genuine distress to many try to travel in relative peace and quiet more than of those who use public transport state that it disturb they accord to recent savanta poll more than of people in separate yougov poll agree that it be unacceptable do the hon gentleman agree that it be odd that the provision apply to people who travel on train but not on bus do he understand why the government make that distinction agree entirely we need simple rule across all public transport also think it be odd that the hon gentleman make that point after his colleague jeered when first raise the issue at prime minister question few month ago but thank he for his support now our amendment would allow local transport authority to introduce byelaw to prohibit such disruptive antisocial noise it would be simple practical measure that would make bus travel well for everyone some have argue that such measure be illiberal but liberalism unlike libertarianism be as concerned with responsibility as with right my right to play loud content on my phone do not preclude my responsibility not to cause someone else unnecessary disturbance by fail to plug in my headphone after all that be why they be invent when first raise this issue at pmq as mention the conservatives and reform who be not here of course jeer at the suggestion can not say whether the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden or other member of the shadow transport front bench team join in that chorus although the prime minister in his extremely constructive answer agree that it be serious issue his labour colleague in committee vote down the amendment which the tories also refuse to support consistent with their previous hostility in bizarre volte face the conservatives have now table an amendment that mirror our own and the shadow transport secretary the right hon member for basildon and billericay have take to the airwave in recent week to demand action on headphone dodger have miraculously see the light or at least hear the noise whether that be because of headphone dodger or conservative headquarters focus group will leave other to judge people say that imitation be the sincere form of flattery and despite the conservatives previous mocking and blocking be delighted to welcome our conservative friend to the cause ask the minister to listen again which would be damned sight easy to do be amendment accept and the headphone dodger be consign to history without doubt the minister will say as he do in committee that the bill already give local transport authority the ability to address antisocial behaviour however it do not explicitly reference the scourge of auditory disturbance which be so serious problem as surely to merit the individual attention that our amendment would provide empower local transport authority to create bus environment that be safe civil and comfortable for everyone if the government be serious about improve the passenger experience they like the late arrive conservative must surely come around to support this sensible liberal democratic policy which accord to savanta be support by vast majority of the public only be opposed new clause would reinstate the bus cap the government recent decision to hike the cap to represent increase that will drive people off bus and hit the most vulnerable in our society absolutely support the reduction of the price cap to however in my constituency where the conservatives cut bus route by more than over the past decade people often have to get several bus so for couple of constituent have go to the jobcentre cost they even though price cap be in place do we not need simple structure and proper investment so that bus do not cost so much those be indeed the issue that we need to address and that be not address at the moment my hon friend be absolutely right the poor who use bus the most be already struggle with the cost of living crisis no amount of spin can hide the fact that the government decision represent huge fare increase despite the prime minister take to social medium last month to proclaim that he be put work people first and that this fare rise would cut cost for work family no it will not in torbay which be sadly one of the most deprive constituency in the south west of england bus travel be the primary form of public transport the price cap be value by young people and by those of work age in navigate torbay do my hon friend agree that its reinstatement would help oil the wheel of our community such as torbay that be hugely important if we want to get people back on the bus and help the most deprived in our society we need to reinstate the bus cap fare have rise to the point where many household simply can not afford to use the bus regularly fare cap would make tangible difference to low income family student and modest earner while also help to reduce congestion and cut emission by get more people out of their car sadly new clause have not be schedule for vote so we will support the conservatives more modest proposal amendment require the secretary of state to conduct an impact assessment of the ending of the bus cap another clause that will not be press to vote be our new clause which would have provide free travel for uniformed police officer in order to provide great reassurance to the travel public antisocial behaviour and not just headphone dodge be on the increase across the bus network and the sight of more police officer on bus would only help to reduce that menace currently there be patchwork of different scheme cover some but not all bus operator and require officer to produce variety documentation to access free travel which be not infrequently deny our new clause would have provide simple baseline require no bureaucracy allow every officer in uniform to travel freely on any bus again ask the minister to consider accept that costless improvement to the safety of the bus network now turn to hugely consequential cross party amendment table by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon whose work on the bill have be thoughtful and persistent his new clause would require the secretary of state to remove time restriction on the use of disabled concessionary travel pass it be support not just by liberal democrats but by member across the house include on the government benches disabled passenger force to travel at restrict time under current rule face unnecessary barrier to job appointment and social inclusion remove time restriction would allow they to use the bus network when they need it it be right that the house should support this new clause and warmly congratulate my hon friend on bring it forward rigid time slot reflect outdate thinking disabled people deserve travel choice that reflect real life need if as they claim during their ill fat attempt to reduce personal independence payment before the recess the government really want to help more disabled people back into work remove such restriction would be wonderful place to start be delighted that mr speaker have select new clause for vote and ask members across the house to bear witness to the cross party support that it have already receive by vote together in support of it in conclusion my party welcome the bill which will make real difference to our bus network but call on the government and the minister to not allow petty party rivalry and tribalism to stand in the way of make this legislation even more effective by vote against the sensible amendment and new clause that we have propose declare an interest as member of the rmt and unite parliamentary group and refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests thank the rmt for its support in scrutinise the bill with thousand of member work in the bus sector across england it be uniquely place to contribute its expertise the context be stark in there be million few bus journey in the north east compare with fall of more than third that decline be not just statistic it represent miss shift social isolation and community cut off from opportunity place on record that support the bill but will speak to the four amendment that stand in my name new clause and and voice my support for new clause new clause would create national bus forum with representative from the government local transport authority operator and trade union deregulation have leave the sector fragment make it hard to tackle challenge such as recruitment retention skill and safety in coherent way the transport committee inquiry into the health of the bus market undertake when be member of the committee recommend that the government strategy be underpin by national forum to share information on service improvement workforce issue and safety the national audit office echo that urge the department for transport to use the bus centre of excellence to collate and share good practice national forum would provide that structure and oversight however national oversight alone be not enough new clause would require all local transport authority introduce franchising to establish joint forum with union and operator the government say that they expect lta to engage with union although expectation be not guarantee however leave this as an expectation will not guarantee meaningful engagement everywhere as we hear from my hon friend the member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury there be inconsistency include in the tees valley some lta be experience in work constructively with union but other be not statutory requirement would ensure consistent and meaningful engagement everywhere new clause and address enhance partnership many local transport authority will opt for enhanced partnership instead of franchising and that be matter for they at present stakeholder forum must include passenger business and neighbouring authority but union be not list respectfully say to the minister that if the aim of stakeholder forum be to involve those most directly affect then surely the workforce can not be exclude new clause and would remedy that by require trade union participation in every enhance partnership forum support new clause table by my hon friend the member for heywood and middleton north mrs blundell which would establish legal duty on council to provide minimum level of night time bus service to local employment centre ensure that worker such as nurse hospitality staff and factory employee can get home safely this be particularly important for woman give that more than one in four will experience some sort of sexual assault in their lifetime night time bus be matter not just of convenience but of safety take together new clause and form coherent package national oversight and good practice match by consistent workforce engagement at local level alongside new clause these new clause demonstrate what this bill should achieve bus system that be accountable safe and responsive to the need of both passenger and staff if the government can not accept they urge the minister to commit instead to address these matter through guidance or code of practice and to meet the trade union and stakeholder to decide how that might be achieve the bill represent an opportunity to reshape bus service for the well but that opportunity will be waste if we repeat the mistake of deregulation fragmentation inconsistency and sideline the workforce these new clause be about make sure that this time we get it right rise to support new clause which stand in my name and that of the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon will also make pass reference to his excellent new clause which wholeheartedly support and which as we have hear be design to remove the time restriction on when disabled person concessionary bus pass can be use new clause be very simple and would like to think very logical it simply require that the secretary of state should within month of this act receive royal assent bring forward proposal to extend the english national concessionary travel scheme to include companion passes for disabled person who require the assistance of designate companion in order to use the bus network be first alert to this problem by some very effective lobbying do in parliament few month ago which other right hon and hon member may well remember be lobby by number of my constituent who say to that there be not much point in have concessionary pass to use bus free of charge if they be unable to do so except when help by companion it rather make mockery of the concession follow this up with visit to the new forest branch of mencap and the implication of the scheme be impressed on as be so obvious as to require little support argument what be the point of give somebody something for free if they can not use it without the assistance of someone else unless designate companion be able to travel with they for free on the same bus pass number of county council for example allow this but it be discretionary power that seem rather strange because number of aspect of the scheme be statutory requirement believe this should be one of they if it be not to make nonsense as have already explain of the statutory requirement that disabled person should have free bus pass have table couple of write question on this topic one in particular number table on april ask the government whether their review of the english national concessionary travel scheme have make recommendation on the question of companion pass for the disabled the answer read in part the department for transport conduct review of the encts and be currently consider next step the review do not consider add companion pass to the statutory criterion for the scheme the answer then add standard formulation that have receive in response to other question on this topic currently local authority in england have the power to go beyond their statutory obligation under the enct and offer additional discretionary concession such as extend the travel time criterion for the enct simply put it to the house that if pass issue authority have statutory duty to provide disabled people with free bus pass there ought to be statutory duty to require designate companion to be include on that same pass for those who can not use it without companion that be probably not something that will be decide today but hope the impeccable logic of my argument will appeal to the minister and that within month he will take the action request it be an absolute pleasure to follow the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis rise to speak to the amendment stand in my name and to new clause and begin by commend the minister for his engagement with on this bill we have have some robust and good dialogue and conversation on float bus stop and be sure he would agree with on that nobody in this place should be surprised to hear speak about float bus stop as we know for more than decade float bus stop have create huge challenge for pedestrian active travel england have rightly say bus stop should be easily accessible the route to the bus stop should be safe direct convenient and accessible for people of all ability be there anybody in this house who do not agree with that my hon friend know that one of the busy float bus stop in my constituency be right outside st thomas hospital which will confess have have few bump on she and do oppose its introduction do she agree that all float bus stop should be review so that when patient be go to important site such as hospital they be not be knock from their bike or buggy my hon friend will not be surprised to hear that agree with her assessment she be right all those year ago do not want to say how long because we will be show our age we oppose that float bus stop outside st thomas hospital because we know the challenge it would present for pedestrian pedestrian continue to be injure at float bus stop with cyclist too often fail to give way even though some float bus stop have small zebra crossing it be rare to see cyclist stop we know that blind and partially sight people be have to walk into cycle lane and into the way of cyclist and they can not see that will be terrifying and dangerous experience for they the risk of injury can undermine their ability to travel independently and safely and not be able to travel independently be life limiting it affect everything from as my hon friend have just say access vital health service to hold down job or just be able to go out and socialise with friend anecdotally we know that people be experience injury and collision at float bus stop for that reason strongly believe that we need to have hard datum if we be to address the problem properly that be why my amendment would ensure that datum be gather on float bus stop and share bus boarder as we know they vary in their design and some pose more danger than other thank my hon friend for her campaigning on this issue she know that as chair of the all party parliamentary group for wheelchair user share similar concern for they we often see that bus ramp be design to fit in with the bus boarder but it be then very difficult for the wheelchair user to pivot from the exit of the bus ramp back on to the pavement will she join in continue to impress upon the government that we have get to get the design right in order to assist all disabled people and that disabled people whether blind or partially sight or wheelchair user must continue to be engage in this dialogue absolutely thank my hon friend for make that point so well be fairly certain that the minister will have hear he loud and clear and will agree it be so important that we get the design right if we be seek to do what be good we need to know what need to be change and we need to collect datum on the design and location of all float bus stop so that we can compare it with the number of collision and injury very much welcome the fact that active travel england will undertake further research include national audit and safety review of all float bus stop to gain an accurate picture of where such bus stop be in use what type they be and so on that could really help to shape future guidance hope that the minister will say little more about when the research will commence because be sure that many people will welcome it although appreciate that there will be an equality impact assessment of the bill as whole and that impact assessment have already be produce it be clear to that there need to be particular focus on the concern of blind and partially sight people when it come to share use bus boarder and float bus stop so my new clause would require an equality impact assessment on their provision if we be to have the truly accessible transport system that we be all strive for we need to pay attention to the impact of our transport decision on disabled people float bus stop be introduce in london in and they have cause havoc my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi mention the one just over the bridge outside st thomas hospital but even in my own battersea constituency they just appear and they really do create challenge for many and not just for disabled people or blind and partially sight people but for the elderly and for family with young child and buggy would go so far as to say that in many respect the safety interest of some group of road user have sometimes be treat more favourably to the detriment of other do my hon friend agree that by get this right and ensure that we have bus stop that be accessible for everybody include partially sight people and disabled people we will encourage more people to use public transport because they will feel that it be safe and accessible for they my hon friend be absolutely right we be encourage people to do more active travel and to use public transport so we need to ensure that the transport network be fully accessible and inclusive the minister have confirm that an equality impact assessment will be publish upon royal assent and press he again to clarify that for right now we have system that blind and partially sight people say put they at risk it be not just with my own live experience say that many blind and partially sight people say it and the many organisation that support they have say the same that tell that we perhaps need to rethink float bus stop indeed if have my way do not unfortunately would ban they all because they have create challenge none the less we be where we be and be really pleased that the government want to work to improve the situation welcome the fact that clause seek to address some of the challenge my new clause would place duty on the government to carry out an independent assessment welcome the government commitment on produce guidance for local service around the country in order to promote active travel but also to ensure that disabled people can travel independently safely and in reasonable comfort in my view that must be mandatory it can not be optional know the minister have hear my concern and he have confirm that that will be the case also welcome the partial pause on some type of float bus stop as member have say it be so important that we address some of the safety concern before move to full scale roll out of float bus stop thank organisation such as the guide dogs for the blind association the national federation of the blind the royal national institute of blind people and transport for all and the many blind partially sight and disabled people for campaign on this issue relentlessly to ensure that we really have public realm that be fully accessible and fully inclusive so that we can all benefit will not push my new clause and amendment to vote fully support the government in their endeavour and support this bill north shropshire be very rural constituency and it be nestle in against the welsh border which be wiggly think that be the good way to describe it that mean that my constituent experience of use bus can be problematic and have table some new clause that hope the minister will reflect on shropshire be one of the worst serve county for bus have lose of its bus mile since it have lose more bus mile by percentage than any other county in england the average loss of bus mile be about so it have be severe experience for my constituent town such as market drayton have almost become isolated because their bus service be so poor be sure the house have hear say before that there be only one bus run in shropshire on sundays be lucky enough to be able to report that it run from town in my constituency but it be hardly an acceptable situation for my constituent new clause be sponsor by colleague from across the house reveal that my constituent experience be share by people in many part of rural britain it try to address the problem of poor bus service in market town by require the secretary of state to ensure that service must be available seven day week and that she consult the relevant body to ensure that constituent use the bus service can access essential service my bus services bill which aim to get people to hospital and other health service when they need to do so have that requirement but it could equally be apply to school college and other important destination for people who find themselves isolate in bournemouth east be campaign to get well bus route to bournemouth airport to improve the no and to reinstate service in throop where the community feel very disconnected do the hon lady agree that one benefit of this bill be that it empower local authority to run their own bus company so that they can reinstate those route be broadly supportive of the bill because think it will do that my point be that the power to franchise bus service be all very well but the funding need to follow the power otherwise constituency such as mine will not see the improvement for which they be desperate colleague have talk about the bus fare cap be supportive of measure to keep it at but must point out that in constituency such as mine which have little in the way of bus service cap have not make huge difference some of the operator have not opt into that cap so it have have limit impact for my constituent important as it be the billion fund announce by the department for transport last november promise to give rural and coastal area real sea change in their bus service but in shropshire as mention it have have the bad drop off in its service in the whole country only million be allocate that be the critical point and why be fully supportive of the bill measure that will allow local authority to decide where bus service be essential the funding need to follow they regardless of whether area be in combine authority or have mayor and it should follow need not just structure urge the minister to take that on board although we be not vote on new clause across the house include on the government benches member have sponsor it many similar amendment have be table that likewise seek to improve bus service for people live in rural area and ensure they be adequate to access essential service urge the minister to consider the intention of my new clause and those of similar amendment table by colleague and commit to some kind of improvement for rural area when he make his closing remark mention that north shropshire be press up against the border with wales and that the border with wales be very wiggly that give my constituent specific challenge with their bus pass if they want to catch bus between two destination in england but it stop in wales or they need to change in wales their bus pass be not valid think that be bit crazy for example if they want to go from oswestry to chester and they need to change at wrexham their bus pass will not be valid that be the one service that run on sunday we need to ensure that people can use their bus pass when they be cross the border that be very low cost thing which ought to be very easy for government to sort out my new clause would require the secretary of state to liaise with the welsh government and come up with workable solution for what be probably an unintended consequence of devolution between england and wales hope the minister will take that on board and consider workable solution for people use their bus pass across the border also table new clause which replicate that requirement for scotland appreciate that that do not impact my constituent in north shropshire but table it in the name of be inclusive be proud to have be one of the first signatory to new clause table by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon will not take any of the credit for the new clause because he have do all the hard work but will urge the minister to consider accept new clause because it be so important disability do not stop at speak in support of the bill and in favour of new clause in my name we can now say in complete confidence that the privatisation and deregulation of our bus service have be catastrophic failure for rural town and village such as those across north east hertfordshire decade of dogmatic adherence to flawed ideology have create vast public transport desert where resident have no meaningful alternative to drive car the consequent social cost of this failure have be profound more and more traffic that stifle our community and choke our river and air with life limit pollution young people cut off from education and employment force to leave their home to get on in life and our elderly trap in loneliness and isolation which should be source of shame for our entire nation the privatisation disaster mean for those unable to drive or afford car connected life in rural england be practically impossible welcome many of the clause in the bill that together offer chance to reverse the hollowing out of our village which threaten to end century of cultural and economic vibrancy we need bus network that comprehensively meet the need of every community especially for rural area that lose their train station in the beeching cut include buntingford westmill braughing and standon in my constituency that be why have table new clause which would empower ministers to conduct review into the delivery of guarantee minimum bus service standard for every community with more than resident across england during the progress of the bill run survey on the experience of my constituent of their local bus service hundred of resident respond and massive if unsurprising of they feel that the bus service available do not offer viable alternative to own and drive car as be sure you can imagine madam deputy speaker whether via the survey or in community meeting my constituent have be none too shy in share their thought about the quality reliability and general usefulness of local bus service consequently it be completely clear to that voter in north east hertfordshire be utterly feed up with bus network base on profitability for shareholder rather than public need the measure in the bill to address that with long overdue strengthening of socially necessary bus service be very welcome however to succeed in meet the hope of community such as those that represent we should go far and move towards universal basic right to public transport with enshrined service standard across the country replace the threadbare patchwork and inadequate network leave by deregulation although it may be difficult to imagine give the current state of public transport in our nation that is in fact something that other country be quite happily do already in switzerland the region of zurich guarantee village of people or more at least an hourly bus service run seven day week from am to midnight link rural resident to regional facility for employment education training shopping and leisure while north hesse in germany have target of bus service reach every village across the region every hour now be the time to show that we be no less ambitious for our community and to set out on path towards internationally lead bus service in england to achieve that new clause would trigger review into set minimum bus service standard for community in england consider their vary requirement base on population size and rurality alongside the regulatory power and funding arrangement necessary for local transport authority to implement comprehensive network of this nature look forward to hear the response from the front bench to this new clause which hope they will consider in the positive light in which it be intend note that the minister argue against new clause in committee on the basis that he believe that the legislation to guarantee minimum level of service for community already exist in the transport act gently say to he that have review that legislation with little support from the superb staff at the commons library have not be able to identify any such power be more than happy to accept that may well be wrong on that point madam deputy speaker but suffice it to say that transport act or no the community represent in north east hertfordshire be not yet enjoy bus service remotely comparable to those deliver to guarantee standard in switzerland germany and elsewhere of course comprehensive bus network with guarantee minimum service standard will require adequate public funding and it be important to be up front about that however year on year under successive government we have spend billion of pound on wasteful counterproductive and environmentally damaging road building scheme analysis suggest that redirect that funding to the bus service our constituent need for their day to day life would fully fund guarantee minimum service standard across the country comprehensive bus network base on guarantee minimum service standard would transform public transport across the country especially for rural area it would demonstrate the profound change the labour government be elect to deliver above all it would inject new optimism and opportunity into our community as people would find themselves able to make entirely different life choice young adult could choose to stay live close to friend and family as commute from the village they grow up in would become genuine possibility key worker struggle with the cost of living could avoid debt and hardship without the need to buy and maintain second car and high street business would flourish with great footfall and an expand pool of employee talent and energy it be time for public transport that put people before profit new clause would do just that my constituent want the performance accessibility and quality of bus service to be improve and that be why support new clause thank my hon friend the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew for re table it when the secretary of state speak to the bill on second reading she say that improve bus service underpin the government plan for change if that be the case it strike as odd that the government would strip out new clause make in the other place that specifically state that that be the purpose of the bill also support new clause which call for review of the provision of bus service to village in england there be many village in my constituency with poor or non existent bus route with particular problem in spaxton enmore combwich fiddington and stockland bristol these village find themselves just off the main route with the resident leave all but stranded unable even to get to and from bridgwater unless they have car even in the village that do have service far too often the bus service stop in the early evening for example the last no bus to langport which serve westonzoyland middlezoy and othery leave bridgwater at pm that mean not only that the service fail to cater for those who want to travel for leisure but that many constituent be unable to use bus for commute because they can not get home after work the review should also consider integration between different mode of transport which be an important issue for those live in rural area who need to travel far afield there have be no usable bus stop at bridgwater railway station for several year because of road layout problem it be relatively small fix but despite run somerset council for the last three year the lib dem administration seem unable to fix the problem we must ensure that the bill oblige local authority to act in circumstance such as these and hope the review will assist in that another problem my constituent would wish the review to consider be seasonal timetable be fortunate to represent beautiful part of somerset that attract large number of visitor to both the coast and the quantock hill during the summer demand for bus be understandably high what the bus operator seem to forget however be that the local resident population rely on bus service continue all year round seasonal bus help those in the north of my constituency commute to work or college in weston super mare the reduced frequency of the no bus service and the lack of sunday service in the winter month mean that few people can rely on it hope that the government accept the need for this review and that its result well inform policy when the new franchising be roll out support amendment which call for an assessment of the ending of the bus cap the cap be great achievement of the last conservative government and be disappoint when the labour government decide to scrap it they increase the amount that all our constituent have to pay by and then proclaim it triumph it sound like something from soviet propaganda we be suppose to welcome this glorious new bus fare as some sort of victory of the proletariat over the force of capitalism conveniently forget what precede it want to see the cap reinstate and hope that the assessment will be the first step toward that want to see bus service improve for my constituent believe that amendment and new clause and would improve the bill and urge the minister to accept they refer hon member to my entry in the register of members financial interests and declare an interest as co chair of the all party parliamentary group for british bus within my constituency and the neighbour constituency of the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman be two site of the uk large bus manufacturer alexander dennis which employ around people in falkirk with thousand more job dependent on the bus create at falkirk manufacturer will welcome new clause and the certainty that it give by consolidate the provision of the bill in scotland bus manufacturing in britain have be in difficulty in the past year partly due to the failure of the previous government to deliver on their pledge of british build zero emission bus by in the end they support just over half that number with just under half be buy from abroad the tories fund too few bus and get far too many of they from elsewhere in the world then there be second policy failure this time by the scottish government recent scotzeb programme which see less than one fifth of its bus come from scotland only bus manufacturer and more than three time more come from china stand up for scotland aye right both the conservatives and the scottish national party do not take the protection of the domestic bus manufacturing sector seriously and their failure have jeopardise hundred of job in my constituency and potentially thousand in the supply chain across the country all this be to say that the future of domestic industry that we will need if we want to see green clean safe and effective bus network be contingent on legislation that support the effective domestic procurement of bus and enable local authority to make decision that be right for their area and put the passenger first the bill do an excellent job of deliver on those priority with streamlined and more flexible franchising process strong power for grant funding from local authority and local authority able to order in bulk as in the case of the bee network in manchester the bee network be bolster by bus order from and build in falkirk will never miss an opportunity to remind the house that the bee network bus be reliant on the skill and craftmanship of bus manufacturing worker in falkirk more than they be reliant on any other place that be thank in no small part to the instinct and political foresight of the mayor of manchester to work in the national interest instinct that will be empower across the country by the provision in the bill if only we have the same foresight from the scottish government who must now deliver on their commitment to prospective rescue deal for alexander dennis worker follow the excellent engagement and flexibility of our transport cabinet office and scotland office colleague it be welcome that follow consultation the ban on register non zero emission bus for local service will start no early than as move too fast on the necessary transition to zero emission vehicle would create degree of risk for domestic manufacturer in the current market this year the industry report that of zev bus purchase in the country by local authority and operator will come from china compare with only two year ago that be an alarming share to have be take out of our domestic manufacture we must address that before we throw ourselves head first or too fast into build an exclusively clean green and foreign fleet across the country while be sympathetic to the well intentione environmentalist call in amendment and from the green party to accelerate the non zero emission bus ban that approach would risk create situation in which authority and operator would likely be compel to buy from abroad far undermine the competitiveness of our domestic industry on which my community rely would more than welcome green members engagement with the all party group to discuss how the house can align british industry with the laudable intention of those amendment the uk timeline will align with the transition in scotland as mention as be address in the secretary of state new clause and amendment to accelerate our ambition beyond what domestic capacity allow would create risk that local authority and operator would be compel in the long term to buy an unsustainably high proportion of their fleet from abroad from manufacturer who have receive decade of state subsidy elsewhere repeat the ask of my all party parliamentary group for ministers to use the work of the bus manufacturing expert panel to map out fully fund and coherent pipeline of zero emission bus order that can be meet by our world lead domestic manufacturer and provide the certainty that the sector especially worker in falkirk this week need before the ban come in in as mention falkirk have already see the benefit of local authority control bus network with labour control liverpool and manchester combined authority make clear strategic commitment to partner with uk manufacturer and order significant number of bus from alexander dennis consider strategic and small political local leadership can often make more effective policy decision than the private sector or acknowledge lazy franchiser who all too often simply look to the cheap price rather than consider our national industrial and economic interest more authority operate like that in tandem with the upcoming change to the local authority procurement framework could see we not just protect job in falkirk in the short term but materially enable an expansion of the industry that be essential to deliver the socially positive outcome clearly articulate by hon member in new clause and amendment and to mention just few we can not forget the social benefit of an industry that provide an additional job per job hire in manufacturing the benefit be see in quieter and smoother journey but also in job create and protect taxis pay and community strengthen the bill seem on the whole to be about build up the power of our local authority but it also give we an opportunity to build up the bus manufacturing industry while we set our mind to the task of improve local transport the bill on the whole be well for passenger well for local authority and hopefully well for british worker with the bill we can deliver transport system that be clean affordable and reliable and bus manufacturing industry that thrive for decade to come first stop falkirk with an immediate five minute time limit call tom gordon will start by speak to new clause which stand in my name and be support by over colleague from across the house it call for the removal of time restriction impose on disabled bus pass under the english national concessionary travel scheme eligible disabled people be entitle to free local bus travel the policy rightly recognise that for variety of reason disabled people rely on public transport to access healthcare work and education as well as for family and community purpose the policy also recognise that disabled people be more likely to require financial support as they face disproportionately high cost of living yet from pm to be on weekday that entitlement become void dependent instead on whether travel authority choose or even can afford to extend the benefit disability action yorkshire charity in my constituency first highlight the absurdity of the restriction to last year since that meeting have be campaign to have the time restriction remove have meet and receive support from number of charity that work with disabled people include transport for all whizz kidz bus users uk and the rnib the consensus be clear the current restriction have huge impact on the everyday life of disabled people the amendment would require the secretary of state to remove the time restriction impose by the enct allow disabled passenger to travel for free hour day seven day week regardless of their postcode the fact be simple disability do not disappear at peak time why then be our policy base on arbitrary timeframe to design scheme intend to promote accessibility only to limit it when most people need it undermine the very purpose of the policy the issue come to light when my mum put in touch with her friend amy who get in taxi with her son to drop he off at school she then have to spend minute wait before she can use her disabled bus pass to get home in south yorkshire disabled bus pass holder get in touch with about how their travel journey include one stop in different local authority kurt who be register blind end up be throw off the bus at am liberal democrat councillor have long campaign on this issue include john lawson in kirklees who raise the case of cleckheaton resident with epilepsy who suffer from the restriction too there be around disabled bus pass holder in england make up about of all concessionary user although the dft point out that most local authority offer some form of free travel before am only third provide unrestricted access for many that mean that commute to work attend education or make early medical appointment be either unaffordable or impossible the dft have responsibility to improve accessibility it can not keep kick the can to local or transport authority claim it be up to they to make discretionary change just as the department can enforce the restriction so it can remove it it be time to stop pass the buck provision remain patchy insecure and vulnerable to cut my hon friend may be aware that in east sussex where be lucky enough to be an mp the county council have already remove the restriction on timing indeed he have meet my former liberal democrat council colleague sean macleod to discuss that do my hon friend agree that that create postcode lottery across the country where some people be fortunate to live in place that have remove the restriction and other be not so lucky my hon friend make an excellent point and highlight the work that liberal democrat councillor include he have do over the year to ensure that such provision be make that postcode lottery be completely unfair economically the argument be equally strong we know that disabled people already face high living cost remove the am restriction would open up work and training opportunity that begin before that cut off and crucially the cost of do so be modest research by whizz kidz show that it would cost about of the current annual spend on concessionary travel and we know that for each pound spend on concessionary bus pass it be think that over be bring back in economic benefit end the restriction would deliver more than just transport access it would promote independence reduce isolation improve health outcome and encourage great use of sustainable public transport charity such as whizz kidz have show that young disabled people overwhelmingly support access with many say it would help they build confidence friendship and skill the amendment have support from lead disability charity such as the rnib as well as cross party support in this house now be the time for this labour government to show their commitment to improve access and tear down barrier to inequality by support the amendment the minister and have have many interaction on this subject and be sure he be not surprised to see push for it again today urge he to consider it whether through the bill or far down the line in different possible measure and arrangement it be high time that disabled people have the same freedom to travel the same independence and the same opportunity as everyone else that be what the amendment would deliver and urge all member across this house to support it disability do not start at am so disabled bus pass should not either draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on british bus today debate be so important to the people of shrewsbury as we have lose over two third of our bus route in the past year we be one of the large town in the uk with over resident yet we have not see sunday bus for over decade we also have very few evening bus service which be hold back our nighttime economy despite be glorious tourist destination the new bus power for franchising will be game changer for local council such as our in shropshire they will give we the opportunity to introduce new bus route if they be consider to be socially necessary such as that all important sunday service or some additional stop to widen access to our current hospital bus route and the new health clinic facility come down the track it be our belief that these social route could eventually build up their passenger number and ultimately become economically viable in their own right to that end wish to speak in support of the bill and new clause which seek to bring forward requirement on transport authority to deliver the minimum level of off peak and nighttime bus service that could transform access to employment for many of the resident in my constituency we have only handful of bus service after and only one single bus at yet we be the county town and host to the county health governance economic and education service as well as be major employer for county of resident shift worker nhs staff and those work in hospitality as well as those of we who enjoy hospitality need those bus to run beyond the shropshire bus service user group have consistently campaign on the need for evening and the all important sunday bus service until now no commercial company would take the risk but within the last year bus route add by my local authority use government bus service improvement plan money have lead to increase passenger number and become embed in our network to overcome the reticence of private company to widen their route at economic risk the local authority be ready to do that where legislation allow and where passenger datum indicate that all important demand and socially necessary route the new clause would support shropshire council by underpin the need to re establish evening and sunday bus service give the impetus to widen those route to conclude wish to remind the minister as do in every speech that my beautiful town of shrewsbury lose its sunday service decade ago under the last government and that it be in both our hand to ensure that we reinstate it under this labour government rise to speak in support of new clause which be table by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon and have cros party support really hope that that cross party support hold up in the vote as we have hear disability do not stop at peak time represent rural constituency and our bus be very infrequent so have time restriction on bus pass be even more serious as member of the all party parliamentary group on classic enjoy good tale about mythological creature such as centaur and the minotaur but unfortunately for some of my constituent see bus be almost as likely as see one of they remarkably there be no sunday bus service at all in most of my constituency we have one of the great cathedral in the world but many of my resident can not get to it for sunday worship some of my village have no bus at all and the like of coveney and wardy hill have one bus per week other have bus service every two hour those service be probably some of the good if we restrict disabled people to use their pass after they can not catch the bus and have to wait for the so effectively they can not do anything anywhere else in the morning that can not be right we have to remove that restriction the current situation be not sustainable or acceptable for rural community the situation be so dire that the recent risk of the bus route between littleport and cambridge be halt mean that community face be unable to get to work or college constituent refer to this service as lifeline for they and they be right to have situation in where the ending of single bus route make entire community transport black hole be dreadful it be just not acceptable have resident be properly consult be certain the proposal would have be comprehensively reject which be why support new clause table by my hon friend the member for horsham john milne to require consultation before any discussion on the alteration or withdrawal of local bus service know the new clause have not be select but hope the minister will consider it the government decision to increase the bus fare cap hit my constituent hard because many of they have to get more than one bus to complete their journey ask both for the cap to be bring back to and for it to be cap on the journey not the fare for each bus someone catch it should not be too much to ask for basic functional and affordable transport service for rural community pensioner should not have to miss medical appointment because there be only one bus per hour student should not have to worry about miss class disabled people should not have to miss anything in the morning and people should not have to move from their home village for the sake of get to work on time this bill be positive but the government need to do lot more to improve transport service in rural community such as mine it would be start if we allow the disabled member of those community to catch bus at any time be grateful for the opportunity to speak in support of the bill and new clause and table by my hon friend the member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer the bill represent step towards give community great control over their local transport network colleague across the house recognise how vital bus service be for connect people to opportunity to each other and to the service they rely on sadly bus be too frequently undervalue because they do not have the visible impact of train it be perhaps fitting that the bill come at time when we be experience tube strike in london and our colleague base in london can understand what those of we outside london feel have an entirely dysfunctional public transport network want to raise two point that hope the minister and colleague will take on board as we move towards implementation in my calder valley constituency which the minister know well we have see number of service withdraw or reduce in frequency particularly in the upper calder valley those change have leave many resident feel cut off especially in area where alternative transport be simply not available welcome the extension of franchise power to all local authority that be long overdue and it be step that give community such as mine the chance to shape bus network to make those network work for they urge the government to consider how these power can be support with the necessary funding and guidance so that council can act decisively to protect route that be essential to community life the second point want to raise be about franchising support west yorkshire combine authority plan to bring service under public control and to build network that put passenger at its heart cross boundary route those that run into lancashire or greater manchester will not automatically be part of the franchise while the bill allow for some alternative arrangement there be real risk that those route could be overlook we be border county and border country and be keen to ensure that the need of my resident in todmorden who go to work or school in burnley be not overlook know wyca be committed to work with neighbouring authority and hope the government will support that collaboration passenger in calder valley and across the country do not plan their journey around administrative boundary or transport operation and we need to be mindful of that be confident that the bill will provide well fair bus network and be proud that it be another example of this government make people day to day live well but we must ensure that isolated community across boundary route such as those in calder valley be not leave behind look forward to work with front bench colleague to ensure that those voice be hear will speak to new clause bring forward by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon which would extend the eligibility of disabled bus pass the current restriction which mean disabled bus pass can only be use after be have real and disproportionate consequence for disabled constituent particularly those who rely on public transport as their only mean of get around for many disabled people bus be lifeline they be the gateway to essential medical appointment employment opportunity education and social connection and they mean the difference between isolation and independence in rural area such as frome and east somerset where bus service be already limited there be particular challenge as have be point out by my colleague if someone miss the morning bus because their pass be not valid until be that can mean wait several hour more and be late for work furthermore some of we in this place represent constituency that straddle more than one local authority in those area postcode lottery have emerge disabled resident live just few mile apart be subject to different rule one person bus pass might allow travel before be while their neighbour who live just across an invisible council border be force to wait have see that issue arise at first hand in my constituency have be campaign with hettie diamond bus pass user who live in radstock in my constituency and commute to bath for work radstock fall under the west of england combine authority when hettie raise the unfairness of the be restriction on disabled bus pass write to weca and be pleased to say that it respond positively and extend the validity of the pass to hour day that be significant and meaningful win for people in one half of my constituency however the other half who live under somerset council remain restricted and be still unable to use their pass before am how can that possibly be fair when all that separate they be an invisible line we can not talk about level up or dignity in public life while ignore the daily barrier face by disabled people nor can we claim to support rural community while expect vulnerable resident to navigate postcode lottery of restriction that limit their independence and opportunity urge the minister to look closely at the benefit of remove those time restriction altogether let we give disabled people one less barrier to face in their everyday life and move toward system that treat all with fairness dignity and respect rise to speak in favour of new clause which stand in my name many member may be unaware that the fare cap that apply to single bus journey do not apply to service that be provide exclusively to take child to and from school that be why my new clause call for the national bus fare cap to be extend to all school route and for any future change to the cap to be apply to school only transport too be grateful to the members from across the house who have add their name in support of my new clause in poole and across england the exclusion of school route from the fare cap have leave family pay more simply to get their child to school that can not be right local parent especially those who might have two or more child attend different school in the area have complain to about the unfairness and additional financial pressure that they face as result have raise that with the local bus provider morebus and although it be sympathetic to the argument it will not act unless instruct to do so in legislation have also raise the matter with the department and with the minister but as he will recall be tell that my proposal be too difficult to achieve through the bill therefore urge he to reconsider that approach when he respond to the debate be sure that member will recognise the very obvious unfairness the cap apply for child who get on an ordinary bus that take they past their school but for child on school only bus the fare be high as well as that unjustifiable situation parent be concerned that they can not buy their school ticket in instalment and often have to fund the entire cost of their child bus journey on termly basis that can be expensive and discourage many family from use the bus as their preferred mean of school transport see bus service in the way see most policy through the lens of make life easy for family in poole work hard to get by the bill offer significant step towards build transport network that be genuinely accessible affordable and reliable the government must also be guide by their mission of ensure that every child have the good start in life that mission can not be confine to single department or handful of policy it must run like thread through government departments and be hardwire into how we set priority and deliver change labour value must underpin everything we do extend the bus fare cap to school route be one practical way that the government can ease the everyday struggle that parent face and make family life that little bit easy this simple but impactful measure would reduce the cost of get child to school particularly for family with multiple child and free up parent who would otherwise drive as part of the school run it would mean low cost for working family and less pressure on parent juggle daily mountain of responsibility that also line up closely with the minister ambition to get more people out of pollute car and into public transport which be keen to support recognise that put more money in the pocket of work people require broad change but measure such as extend the bus fare cap to school route could make tangible difference to day to day life while build fair and more accessible transport system for everyone therefore urge the minister to consider new clause seriously and to see how the government can address the unfair anomaly on school only bus travel day in day out hear from people across my constituency from polegate to plumpton who want to use the bus but simply can not do so people must be at the heart of transport policy so let begin with one example from my constituency recently hear from woman in wilmington village who want to get to her job in lewes by bus but can not do so at present to do so she must travel in the wrong direction to polegate wait then take slow service through multiple village what would be minute drive become an hour or more on the bus so she drive that be not lifestyle choice it be failure of network design this bill could give we the tool to put that right if we use they properly the in my constituency desperately need direct service between eastbourne and lewes and we must make that happen the stop be on the road there be just no bus to serve they that be exactly why support amendment on socially necessary route so that journey to work school and health service be guarantee even when the market will not deliver franchising power in the bill mean that our local transport authority could finally design service around what people need not what happen to be commercially convenient the new duty to provide socially necessary route must make that real our amendment would ensure that if the market will not deliver the authority must step in and be properly fund to do so the express should be at the top of that list recently hear from young lady in stone cross in my constituency who try to get to college bus fail to appear one recently sail by she when she be wait and that mean lose education time the power in the bill on performance datum and enforcement must bite we must publish stop level reliability and give local transport authority the lever to withhold payment for no show and require operator recovery plan we must also back our headphone dodger amendment so that authority can make byelaw against sustained antisocial noise safe civil journey retain passenger much like the case in stone cross see the same story repeat in the village of ringmer an year old constituent depend on the bus to reach the tesco in lewes yet sometimes it never arrive and at other time the driver simply drive on by that be not public service it be gamble if people be to use these service they must be able to rely on they that be why back amendment on accessible stop place and reliability we must ensure that information be clear that driver be train and that passenger be not leave strand rural village across my constituency send the same message they have gap long wait and first and last bus that do not work for people real life community transport service be lifeline in rural area where commercial route do not run in my constituency volunteer lead cuckmere buses and ctla keep people connect the sussex art shuttle run by cuckmere buses show how small community drive transport project can open up access and enrich local life these scheme run on tight budget and good will yet they deliver where the market will not amendment would recognise their value and ensure that funding stream work for they not against they there be also the flexibus scheme forward think initiative from east sussex county council show how local authority can take control and fill the gap leave by traditional service with book available by app or phone it be practical people centre service that make rural transport work for many new clause on vat rule for demand responsive service would make it easy for such scheme allow council to innovate locally and deliver real solution for community sadly in lewes we have lose our bus station year of campaigning could not save it the result be an interchange tack on to the phoenix causeway bridge busy expose and in the wrong place it be not possible to grow ridership while dismantle the place where people change bus we should give local transport authority explicit power duty and funding to safeguard and replace our interchange as part of franchising scheme that be why new clause on accessibility report so that bus station and interchange be explicitly safeguard and properly plan be so important the upcoming budget must unlock much need funding for major road that be congest and therefore delay bus service have raise the in my constituency directly with the prime minister in this place it be vicious cycle congestion hold back bus people turn back to car and traffic get bad well bus mean few car and transition to zero emission fleet must be central to how we plan for the future affordability underpin all of this the liberal democrats new clause would restore the fare cap which work well it put money back in pocket and passenger back on seat lift it be bus tax on work study and care our new clause would restore the cap and require formal assessment of the impact of hike we go far new clause would provide free travel for those on carer allowance and new clause table by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon would remove time restriction for disabled concessionary pass this bill will be judge not by what it promise on paper but whether it deliver for people who wait at the bus stop and hope this government will deliver that rise to speak to new clause which cover issue of accessibility my old young and disabled constituent often tell that they be leave strand endure painfully long waiting time due to unreliable bus service and face distressing situation such as toilete issue miss nhs appointment or arrive late at school this be the reality of fail bus service face by many constituent across my penistone and stocksbridge constituency as result of the conservative legacy this be unacceptable as mention on second reading when reform mps could not even be bother to show up where be they today when be grow up our south yorkshire transport system be the envy of the world but year of the conservatives north south transport divide and their broken promise of london style transport system for south yorkshire in reality mean that my constituency lose of its bus service with paltry spend per head on our doorstep compare with london and the tram link bus be scrap leave many of my constituent unable to continue to work or to go to college in sheffield our local community have help build the prosperity of this great nation from the speciality steelwork in stocksbridge and the farmer across penistone to the advanced manufacturing site across chapeltown my constituent be among the hard work people we could ever meet the hon lady and share huge concern for ensure access to all type of transport include bus for the disabled of every kind do she agree that the strike in london which be cripple transport service be cause great harm to the disabled community here than in any other part of the country the accessibility plan that this bill will now put in place will dramatically improve the accessibility of bus network up and down this country my constituent have the potential to be the beat heart of british growth with good well connect public transport that unleash their potential our labour government have already begin to power this change for transport south yorkshire be already set to benefit from billion of extra transport funding under this government add billion to our regional economy be proud to support the bill which will finally end the tories postcode lottery of bus service and will save and create vital bus route by support every community to take back control of our bus network through new power to set route fare and service community will finally have proper say in the essential service that they rely on instead of route and fare be leave to the whim of unaccountable private operator transport inequality lead to health inequality too which be why it be fantastic that as result of the work do in the lords the bill will also require local transport authority as say to the hon member for bognor regis and littlehampton alison griffiths to produce bus network accessibility plan furthermore driver disability awareness training will become mandatory for the first time as result of the measure in the bill our labour south yorkshire mayor oliver coppard will be far empower to take back control of our bus with franchising secure the reintroduction of the tram link bus in my constituency be my top priority as part of that scheme so too be vital improvement to the no bus serve penistone dodworth and surround rural village which be some of the bad serve by poor bus route in the country after decade and half of tory transport inequality in my constituency have already be crack on to deliver well bus help my old and disabled constituent last month launch the beautiful new no hopper bus the little don circular around stocksbridge and deepcar the vital no extension bus connect the village of bolsterstone for the first time in decade my constituent have describe the new service as thrilling improvement to their quality of life and lifeline that have enable they to cope with life necessity not strand and dependent on other but do not want to stop there want to work with the government my constituent and our labour mayor to look at additional hopper route around wharncliffe side oughtibridge and grenoside to connect to reinstated tram link bus my constituency be the gateway to the peak district and will continue to work with the national park team well to connect local beauty spot such as langsett with new bus route my constituent be already see the benefit of this government choice on transport the bill will bring well bus transport close to home equitable access to transport connectivity be the golden thread that weave our urban and rural community together that keep our family and friendship close and that ensure that people grow up and grow old in my constituency can fulfil their potential will speak mainly to new clause and in my name there be lot to like in the bill but it be at its weak where it touch on rural area that be great shame because if we could solve transport we could also solve the rural productivity problem economic inactivity be nearly two and half time high in rural area than it be in urban area and that be directly relate to transport issue if we could boost rural productivity to urban level it would fix the chancellor budget deficit in one go the key freedom that the bill bring be to support local authority that want to establish bus franchise or to set up their own municipal service if we stand back to look at the scale of the challenge however do we really think that that will be enough to reverse the long term decline in rural area the answer must be no give how cash strapped and under resource most local authority be it be clear that most will be unable to take advantage of that freedom without additional support in my previous life as west sussex county councillor serve on committee consider bus improvement plan but the measure we be give to look at be all small and tactical no one on that committee believe that the plan would change the curve too many local authority long ago surrender to tacit acceptance of manage decline that have to change hence my new clause which would set out new duty actively to promote and increase bus usage the key paradox that must be solve be why if public demand for bus service be so high usage be always drop clearly price be one issue but the service have also become increasingly mismatch with local need in west sussex survey find that of resident have stop use bus because of lack of suitable route or infrequency of service that be huge percentage of the potential market to give away the problem especially in rural area be that what we have leave today be legacy service the ghostly outline of route and frequency that exist year ago we have fight long defensive war of attrition and we have be lose individual route have be salami slice to destruction that be why have table new clause to require local authority to consult in advance on significant service change in my constituency of horsham resident of partridge green discover they be lose their direct no service to town only when they see the new timetable in slinfold the no be remove altogether also without any warning the county council say that the change be nothing to do with they and they be the responsibility of the commercial operator but the operator say that they be up to the council there be simply no one leave at the wheel of our local bus service when look at the huge public reaction as villager fight to save their service after the axe have already fall could not help but wonder what might have be what might have happen if we could have harness that enthusiasm to create service that meet people transport need we have be beat down over many year into accept that it be impossible to fix the problem yet switzerland austria and germany in area with far low population density than many area of the uk be provide all day every hour service seven day week we can do that too if we have the will it be good to see bus service get legislative attention and appreciate that but hope that the government do not think that this bill will be nearly enough by itself urge the government to make special study of the need of rural area which have be recur theme during the debate and work out what it would take to genuinely reverse decline it be pleasure to speak in the debate support new clause introduce by my hon friend the member for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff who be temporarily not in his place it would require the secretary of state to conduct review into the minimum bus service standard require for community in england what member notice when they come to london from rural constituency such as my constituency in suffolk be all the red bus all over the place route run from early in the morning until late into the evening in no small part because of the year of excellent labour administration that londoners have enjoy out in suffolk we certainly do not have fully integrate bus service for start there be simply not enough bus from decade of decline public funding leave the interwoven jumble of local bus map look decisively threadbare from to of bus service in my county council area simply vanish in bury st edmunds and stowmarket have be support resident fight to save local bus route and be sure that many hon member will have be do exactly the same in their area in bury st edmunds we manage to get the and bus route retain which be essential for get child to school at the thurston community college at marham park where resident be in danger of be fully cut off we do the same thank to million of funding from the government in the year to come we will far undo the loss of bus service some new or improved bus route be roll out just this month across suffolk if people be lucky enough to live on route that survive the last year the problem be that they will be hard pressed to find bus that go anywhere after in the afternoon imagine lady from the village of honington in my constituency who have to attend pm appointment at the west suffolk hospital about her dodgy knee the bus run from honington to bury st edmunds four time day so she catch the pm bus and arrive in bury st edmunds with an hour to spare she have her appointment and she get out of the hospital after an hour so at pm she be stand outside the hospital and she can not get home she have miss the last bus and she be stick in bury st edmunds she can not march mile home because she have dodgy knee and she have no friend so she get taxi taxi be but our imaginary lady have no choice she have to pay that we cap the cost of bus fare at but we all know that for lot of real people in rural area inadequate bus service mean that transport cost easily spiral out of control that be why we need to critically examine the minimum bus service standard require across community in england many member have speak about cpre which have mention that some country such as switzerland legally mandate public transport frequency for community of different size the amendment table by the hon member for north east hertfordshire who still have not return to the chamber will ensure that progress be make towards undo some of the inequality that have build up in transport and will move we much close to the unified transport model that we all know we need rise to support amendment that will serve to ensure the most vulnerable and isolated people in our community be not cut off from employment health service education and leisure will start with new clause table by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon who have just return to the chamber that new clause would remove the start time from the use of disabled bus pass must declare an interest as my own son george have one of those pass it be crucial element of help young people with disability to gain their independence and for teenager and young adult with additional need it be far more cost effective option for access college and school than provide costly and isolate taxi the bus pass that george and many of his classmate hold can not be use on the way to school in our case that be two bus and two fare but can be use on the return journey while that cause frustration to parent such as for other it be completely unaffordable it force many of they to use the offer council taxi which be crippling council for those who be able to drive blue badge be not time restrict why should those on bus pass be discriminate against we know that people with disability be less likely to be in employment so anything that reduce barrier to work should be grasp by this government when this issue be raise in an adjournment debate by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough the minister point to the cost but as the proposal would affect only disabled bus pass and not the whole concessionary bus pass scheme it would apply to only of pass so the cost be fairly low turn to liberal democrat new clause and as well as new clause table by my hon friend the member for west dorset edward morello which relate to young people the very first motion put to my party conference back in propose extend discount bus fare for young people that policy make it into the follow lib dem manifesto and have remain in some form ever since cite case then that apply now that of young person from bere regis who secure an apprenticeship in bournemouth they be no long eligible for free bus pass to access the college course because for some reason when the age of participation be increase the age of bus travel be not they have to take several bus each day to access their job the cost of do so take up such large proportion of their income and the service to their village be so poor that they have to give up their apprenticeship if we be to make bus service sustainable into the future they need to be genuine choice for young people an alternative to buy car or motorbike if we be to deal with congestion and air quality and reach our net zero target we need public transport to be real option for everyone achieve long term change typically start with young people it make sense young people be familiar with use bus for school so extend discount so that they have they available as they start in the world of work or high education be most likely to deliver the long term change that we need student from the purbeck school and magna academy have all write to confused about why they be not eligible for discount bus fare even though they be now expect to stay at school this policy feel like clear oversight from previous government and one that could be easily fix by this government also support my neighbouring mp the hon member for poole neil duncan jordan who have propose cap extension for school service not extend the cap to those service be incredibly unfair have also be lobby on the issue particularly by family live in merley who be just about within the three mile window during my village tour in the summer whether be in bere regis gaunt common shapwick or hinton martell the no issue that come up be bus community that be cut off from bus service can not thrive so welcome amendment and and new clause and which would ensure that such community be consider and whether it be via commercial service or community minibus that small village be not cut off it seem ironic that british people always use the phrase you wait for bus and then two come along at once for thousand of my constituent in mid dorset and north poole village just one every so often would be nice my amendment and new clause be not intend to change government policy nor to bind the hand of locally elect mayor or transport authority quite the opposite amendment which my hon friend the member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury the chair of the transport committee talk about some considerable time ago would require local transport authority to set out clear transparent formula for calculate whether service be socially necessary and then to use that formula in decide how funding be allocate that reflect recommendation in the transport committee bus connect community report amendment would purposefully give local leader flexibility to create their own formula because the minister be right that priority will differ from place to place the amendment would not be diktat from whitehall but window into decision making for the first time allow resident to see what be be prioritise and why the amendment would make it clear where the cut off point for taxpayer support lie when resource be scarce it could also empower local community for example if one criterion in the formula be usage passenger or would be passenger could rally together use bus and protect it by use it more more importantly the amendment would stop support service list from stagnate as new development spring up its need might then be include the amendment would curb the risk that the loud voice secure the good bus we would have service design and funding guide not by noise but by number very much welcome the minister assurance that socially necessary local service guidance will ask local authority to publish description of the methodology use but give that he now accept the principle see no reason why we should not put it in the bill to future proof this concept new clause which also table relate to growth duty want to give local leader the tool they need to do the job as have say before in this place it be wrong to pigeonhole local transport authority as the place of stick plaster solution success lie in active local leader embrace network wide approach that will inevitably mean tough decision and trade off it will sometimes mean the choice to enhance one route over support another such as by increase the frequency of well use exist service extend the operate hour of commercially viable bus or add some extra stop at either end of route give that we be about to have in primary legislation more obligation on socially necessary service we should balance that with duty in legislation for the lta to consider use some public money to grow and improve its exist local bus service because in the round that be the way we get well bus the minister have suggest that new bsip guidance will address those point but gently say that bsip guidance can change the original bus service improvement plan mechanism be specifically not about support exist route and then there be an about turn in with legislation not guidance should support local leader to make the call on service enhancement and provide the ability to try new and innovative approach when the goal be to grow passenger number after all grow passenger number be ingrain in the national bus strategy and be pleased that the minister mention it in the first part of his opening remark welcome the minister constructive engagement as we have discuss set standard to increase ridership through statutory guidance on stop place we have also discuss franchise guidance and be clear that it be not enough just to consult current passenger we need would be passenger too after all we need more people on bus and everything we do have to be about encourage more passenger more farebox mean well service overall on that note thank grant palmer for what it do in dunstable recently and also thank the dawsongroup for bring bus to parliament as part of catch the bus month this september wish all member and you madam deputy speaker very happy catch the bus month two week ago the no bus make its final journey yet another bus service my constituent rely on have be lose with no apparent thought give to how people be suppose to get to work school college or hospital appointment or simply from to the withdrawal of the which take resident directly to winchester hospital will make life significantly hard for many of my constituent that be why support new clause which would guarantee every town regular bus service to hospital and gp surgery and amendment which would ensure that socially necessary route include those serve hospital school and college as well as the we have see the withdrawal of the the major route that serve peter symonds college and the which be an important service for the resident of valley park they be cut because they be not consider commercially viable but healthcare and education be essential service no one should be leave isolated from school college or hospital simply because bus company can not turn profit in addition to cut to bus service conservative control hampshire county council decision to withdraw discretionary top up enhancement to the english national concessionary travel scheme have increase challenge for my disabled constituent support new clause table by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon because disabled people must not be unfairly restrict in when they can travel the removal of the companion bus pass and the restriction of free travel to between am and pm create fresh barrier for many disabled people include the visually impair resident in hampshire last month visit the guide dogs community team centre in chandler ford where speak to constituent who be deeply worried about the cut one tell she now struggle to reach medical appointment while another due to her disability prefer early morning bus to avoid bright sunlight which cause her severe eye pain have be support guide dogs campaign to make sure that people with visual impairment can travel independently and with confidence many visually impair constituent understandably require assistance to travel safely often rely on friend and family to accompany they to work school and medical appointment have hear from constituent that lose access to the companion pass have mean that they be travel less and resort to costly method of travel include taxi to get around the saving to the council be minimal compare with the cost to my constituent quality of life that be why new clause which would remove time restriction on disabled concessionary pass and new clause which would extend free travel to carer be so important they would help restore independence and dignity to those who need public transport the most hope the government will accept the amendment that have address and ensure that socially necessary route be protect because my constituent need affordable reliable bus now have the pleasure of serve on the bill committee and be pleased to see the bill back before the house although it do good work it simply do not go far enough in its ambition or its delivery of the change we need that be apparent from the number of amendment table on report one of the really important amendment for be new clause table by my hon friend the member for wimbledon mr kohler spend the final week in august visit dozen of north norfolk village as part of my summer tour hear about huge range of issue but consistent theme across my area be frustration with our bus shirley and david in hindringham tell that two bus day just be not enough to get they to the place they need to go at the time they want to get there they be right that be indicative of system that serve nobody in rural area like mine it be not just anecdote that back up that feeling the number do too those of we in the east of england get less than half the spend per head on transport as those in london we accept that the transport system in our capital be different and that overall more money end up be need to accommodate the million who need it but to spend on each individual londoner more than double the amount that be spend on my resident be patently unfair and that be before we consider the advantage that urban area have they be set up for carry out public transport run bus network through busy well populate area will always be easy and cheap per head than have to dart around country lane pick up at small village handful of time day be excited about the prospect of franchising which could bring real benefit to norfolk bus service however rural area like mine be embark on the unknown franchising have track record in big city such as manchester and london but how we make it work in other area with different characteristic remain unknown that be why new clause be so important we should not be prescriptive and nobody want to force area into pre design template but we have to offer they suitable support and off the shelf model so that they do not go through it totally alone as the transport committee of which be member find in its bus connect community inquiry there be lot to learn from elsewhere when it come to run successful bus network especially in rural area without provide some of that knowledge in the form of clearly research and define transport model option worry that we be set up another postcode lottery whereby the quality of how these new power be use depend on whether transport authority get lucky in try to make new scheme work speak in committee about how one such model should be rural bus hub and speak network which would give the most coverage possible to as many area as possible try to reach every single village all the time just be not feasible and we have to accept that what be feasible be make sure that every village be near to rural bus hub that be accessible through walk cycling or short drive these hub if connect to one another will finally create rural network we have to start challenge old idea about how rural public transport work and to be bold in the solution we take forward be very supportive of new clause table by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon to its credit norfolk county council have voluntarily expand the time when people can use disability bus pass and have hear positive testimony of how this have help many people in my area people across the country should be able to benefit from that equally so hope the government will support new clause tonight make no apology for constantly bang on about bus it can not be beyond we to build rural bus network that take people where they want to go when they want to go there welcome the step that the government be take but urge they to seize the opportunity before they they should not let this bill go through as an unfunded damp squib that create some new power with no help in their delivery hope they will take the suggestion of member on board tonight and make this the well possible bill to drive forward the much need rural bus revolution will speak to new clause and and amendment this government be give more power to local authority such as the franchising of local bus service they expect council to fund more bus service while they undermine and reduce council core funding at the same time our amendment would require the secretary of state to assess the adequacy of central government funding to support franchise scheme that be essential because due to the pandemic bus service usage massively decline in my constituency of wokingham since then the lib dem run council have act to improve local bus service increase the frequency of service on key route it be now predict that bus service in wokingham will recover to pre pandemic rate the lib dem run council have do that despite be one of the lowest fund unitary authority in the country but labour new council funding formula will take million away from wokingham over the next three year how can the labour government expect council such as wokingham to improve service and take on the responsibility create by this bill without proper support from government as be call for in amendment wholeheartedly support new clause table by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon which propose that time restriction be remove from disabled people concessionary pass that would be widely welcome by many of my constituent also support new clause table by the liberal democrats which would restore the fare cap that would help young and old constituent in my wokingham constituency there be lot to welcome in the bill and support the overarching aim however there be several important detail that very much concern small operator and community transport provider in my witney constituency and shall speak on their behalf they include west oxfordshire community transport include andrew coles andrew lyon and their team and david miles and amanda who have do so much to get the first last mile move my fear be that the franchising framework and new training requirement stipulate in the bill will squeeze out community operator and that the social and economic cost will be severe particularly in rural area where mainstream operator have withdraw section community bus permit holder who provide transport on not for profit basis without the need for full public service vehicle operator licence ensure service in community that would otherwise be completely unserve the bill currently do not recognise this category at all that raise couple of worry one particular worry be that the new driver safeguarding and training requirement could become unworkable for small fleet the bill provision do not clearly differentiate between private hire vehicle dedicated school bus and public service bus which may sometimes carry schoolchildren as part of the general route in practice that mean that every driver would need full safeguarding training regardless of the service they normally operate for large company that would be manageable but for small operator with mixed or volunteer driver such as west oxfordshire community transport and first last the infrastructure to train and certify every single driver at short notice simply do not exist community bus service already provide some training for their driver volunteer and employee but we be seek proportionate requirement for driver and transitional support to help small operator to meet new reporting and training burden another real threat for community operator be around franchising and tender small and community operator risk be lock out of very complex bidding process and lack of guarantee inclusion in they compete for franchise contract demand administrative and legal capacity well beyond what volunteer lead organisation can manage what be need to address that be explicit protection for community operator within franchising model there be much to welcome in the bill but say again that there be risk of some unintended consequence ask the minister to look into they over the summer recess hold surgery in town and village across my constituency and an issue that come up again and again and again be bus or rather the lack of they many community in my rural constituency be now effectively cut off some have just one or two bus day but other such as bigbury st ann chapel and ringmore have no service at all since bus journey in devon have fall by under the previous conservative government service be cut scale back or make so unreliable that they be no long usable do not think it be coincidence that not single conservative back bencher be in the house to talk about the state of our bus service since the election last year the cut have continue the gold bus which go from plymouth and torbay and be vital connection for lot of rural community between large economic centre have be downgrade this month this be not just about inconvenience it be about opportunity or the lack of it bus connect people to job education healthcare and each other without convenient frequent and affordable service people of all age be be leave behind in some area the last bus leave before the work day end strand carer hospitality worker and student and stifle our visitor economy that be why support amendment and which require local transport authority to identify socially necessary route and ensure service provision where commercial service be unable to meet demand transport planning must reflect the reality of people daily life and access to healthcare and education should not be dictate by commercial viability devon have the large county road network in the country but only seven commercially viable route we need more bus not few to encourage more regular usage it become virtuous circle public transport play crucial role in iron out inequality in session on child poverty this morning in this place transport come up several time as an element that be contribute to child poverty level when visit school and college regularly hear about the prohibitive cost of public transport even just few pound for journey be significant amount for student and hit disadvantaged student the hard this be why support new clause and to offer discount for and those in education to ensure that transport be not barrier to education or employment another issue affect resident in my constituency be the postcode lottery on concessionary bus pass in devon and torbay as many other have say usage be restrict to after be on weekday which mean that resident may not be able to attend early medical appointment or get to work on time as this government be keen to encourage disabled people back into the workplace that must be look at devon county council tell that the revenue support grant mechanism provide by central government have fall substantially since it be introduce to the point that the scheme be now primarily financially support through council own revenue budget concessionary travel in the devon county council area be expect to cost nearly million this financial year while the cost of offer be travel to all passholder be estimate to be million per annum be really proud to support new clause put forward by my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon which would remove time restriction on the use of concessionary travel pass but local authority must be properly fund for it in the face of all the challenge local people be step up and would like to highlight the incredible community run service we have in south devon include bob the bus the west dart bus and the coleridge bus group help to fight rural isolation reduce loneliness and provide vital lifeline to those who would otherwise be cut off these service be under grow pressure small transport operator should be prioritise for grant from local transport authority ensure that they can continue to support those who rely on their service therefore support amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for wimbledon mr kohler whose work on the bill commend public transport in rural community be basic service but right now in far too many part of south devon it simply do not exist while support the many positive measure in the bill we must go far to fully address the need of rural area and ensure that no community be cut off decent public transport alleviate poverty reduce the number of car on the road and enable the young the elderly and those who can not drive or afford car to participate fully in the economic and social life of their community it do require serious investment but the gain to be have from this financial commitment be exponential the previous government waste billion on the cancel leg of high speed which be almost enough to fund service to every village every hour of every day across england imagine the transformational power of that if the right choice be make thank my fellow member and the chair of the public bill committee for the work they do feel work on the committee be very constructive from the different opposition members it follow some very constructive amendment that be make and agree in the other place too include on village and vision zero for road danger be sad to see so many good idea defeat and remove in committee think this issue cross party boundary it should be about practicality not party politic on road danger be pleased to have table new clause and with support from member of the rmt which seek to improve safety through driver support and wellbeing these measure be all necessary to achieve vision zero for road danger for our bus be full of support for new clause and other measure that seek to remove time restriction on concessionary bus pass have these time restriction be major disincentive to work the government can not keep dodge this contradiction in their stated policy and must act to enable disabled people mobility and enact real equality young people too have receive attention with the new clause table by the hon member for poole neil duncan jordan and in liberal democrat measure myself have table new clause which seek simply to enact policy that be already in place in scotland in order to give free bus travel to anyone under the age of today however want to advocate mainly for clean air as the promoter of the clean air human rights bill ella law and for toilet access to be take seriously by government in relation to bus my amendment and would help to fix those policy gap the clause in the bill on zero emission bus seem to block the high ambition by not set the early date for mandate on new procurement of zero emission bus until that be really long time still to be buy dirty diesel power bus it be extremely poor when dirty air be killer and when in certain street and hotspot often where the least advantaged live clean bus can make real difference and it be in the gift of public authority to deal with it believe that the mayor of london and transport for london begin procure zero emission bus only as long ago as give that some london route be very long indeed such bus could be introduce in other area much soon with the right help and investment the infrastructure could be build and good green job could be fill as imply by the hon member for falkirk euan stainbank have yet to hear good reason from ministers why the clause be so tragically unenterprising another vital issue of equality be ensure that access to toilet feature in local transport plan for bus infrastructure and facility this be the ideal time for to be talk about this topic apologise to member who have also be in the debate for while as age uk say in january in its delightfully name lift the lid report for old people those with health condition and many other the availability of public toilet can determine whether they feel able to leave their home it be basic equality of mobility my green colleague on the london assembly be famously very persuasive work with group include age uk they have gain consensus and win investment and target have be set for toilet access on the tube network toilet should be no more than minute of travel time away the minister talk about create more accessible stop place that kind of standard access to essential toilet facility on bus route would enable mobility and it be so achievable hope that ministers will listen and take these proposal forward in their work call the shadow minister we have have an interesting debate with around to speaker and some theme have develop from it number of speaker mention disability access particularly issue with float and share border bus stop for those who be visually impaired or blind other speech focus on concessionary travel during rush hour and concessionary companion pass we also hear number of description of local bus need in right hon and hon member constituency particularly focus on rural need want to pick out two or three speech for commendation start with that of my hon friend the member for bridgwater sir ashley fox who speak in support of amendment and new clause and he highlight concern failure by his liberal democrat county council so if we want to improve bus service we know where the liberal democrats can start commend the contribution from my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis who put his name to and champion new clause which aim for companion pass to form part of the concessionary travel scheme would like to mention the contribution from the liberal democrat spokesman the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler because he have tiny pop at the conservatives particularly about new clause relate to antisocial behaviour think this require bit of explanation it be right of he to highlight that the position of his majesty opposition have change on this measure and will explain why when we discuss new clause in committee the hon member will recall if he do not he can always refer to hansard that be very sympathetic to the objective of his new clause but as now accept take rather narrow objection to its drafting the new clause add description to non exhaustive list and be therefore technically not require because the definition be already employ the definition be one of nuisance and audible antisocial behaviour be by definition nuisance it be the lawyer in come out and be be slightly otiose do the shadow minister accept that make the point to he in committee that he be be too narrowly lawyerly do he also accept that when raise the issue at prime minister question the conservative benches jeered almost unanimously on this point stand correct in the sense that have listen to the hon member and on reflection accept that be make perhaps too legalistic point if by add sustained antisocial auditory disturbance to the definition of nuisance we can make what be an imply power an express one be happy to support that as for the jeering perhaps my hon friend be cheer who know rise on that point will give way the shadow minister mention how the conservative party come to change its view on my hon friend amendment on audible noise one thing that have not come up during the debate be his party position on new clause which would extend concessionary bus pass give that the argument be an economic one and his party want to see disabled people get to work will he support that tonight be grateful although be not sure whether that be an intervention on jeer or cheering and the difference between they will go so far as to say that be not in position to make economic spending commitment at the dispatch box although we be supportive of the principle that be why we will not vote for something that write blank cheque for the future because at least the conservatives be try to be economically responsible without amendment the bill be miss opportunity in relation to bus stop design and disability access it be miss opportunity in relation to antisocial behaviour on bus and bring that in line with the protection already enjoy by rail passenger it be also miss opportunity not to focus on passenger as the primary object of all action undertake as result of the bill particularly in relation to rural area the bill be not just miss opportunity it be also in its current drafting damage for the future prospect of the provision of bus service because it risk expose local transport authority to potential bankruptcy without support from the secretary of state that is in the first instance in term of oversight of plan for franchising particularly for small local transport authority and give they the all clear secondly if franchise system be set up and then they fail to provide over prolonged period the secretary of state must surely be able to step in and provide those service if we be interested in the experience of passenger as oppose to the organisation have raise those two issue consistently throughout committee and early on today they be significant genuine concern that prevent the opposition from support the bill in its current form thank the shadow minister for the way in which he be approach the debate local authority all over england be let contract every single day and all manner of contract could go wrong what be peculiar about this power that mean there be risk of bankruptcy be sorry that the hon member be not in his place throughout the course of the debate as he would have hear that franchise be not normal contract under an enhanced partnership or standard operating contract that be exactly so contract be let and the commercial risk lie with the provider the challenge with franchising be that the commercial risk be transfer to the taxpayer because the local transport authority be no long let commercial contract it be buy in service for price with the commercial risk lie with the taxpayer that be the crucial difference be glad that the hon member put his finger on that because be as worried as he be about it finally will mention the comment of the hon member for brighton pavilion siân berry we do not agree on many issue but do agree with she on this she say that lot of good amendment be table by opposition party certainly three party there be sadly none from reform which would not know transport policy if one get up and slap it in the face the hon lady come up with some good idea and even the liberal democrats come up with something or other as for the conservatives we come up with good idea after good idea yet until now they have all be reject by the government look forward to the minister response and to his concession on all those good idea with the leave of the house thank those who have contribute to today debate have carefully listen to the point raise the breadth of interest show that although we may not agree on the approach we share an ambition to improve bus for all passenger as have mention throughout the passage of the bill this government strongly believe that local leader be well place to make decision for their local community they know and understand their area specific need and have direct relationship with their community we do not want to increase the number of burden on they we must trust the local area that we be empower to take the right decision for local people even though recognise the importance of ensure that there be full accountability there be large number of amendment that do not align with that core principle and that would actually increase the burden on local transport authority amendment have also be propose today that would take away key funding decision from local area require they to fund specific part of the bus service in their area without consider the possible negative consequence that will undoubtedly arise for other as have mention this government seek to provide great flexibility in how local area use its bus grant local leader be well place to make decision for their community and we must trust they to do that will respond to several point raise by the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew on the bee network in greater manchester despite what the conservative party claim franchising be deliver on time and on budget there and that be despite the overly complex process that they have to go through because of the previous government bus services act we be correct the mistake of that legislation cut red tape and make the process more efficient hope that the minister be not mislead the house inadvertently although he be right that it be deliver on time and on budget it be about million it be argue that the subsequent year of operation have deficit of about million even though it may have be deliver on time and on budget it have be in terrible deficit ever since and be on strike now be afraid that we have be around this roundabout quite few time neither recognise nor agree with those figure we would have think that the conservatives as the party that give greater manchester the power to franchise bus would be more supportive of one of the few positive thing that they do in government if the conservative party think it be so important why do it not do something about it while in office also remind the shadow transport secretary the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden that he be literally the bus minister let we not forget that it be conservative government of the who deregulate bus outside london which lead to service be cut fare go up and patronage go down this labour government be reverse decade of decline in bus service the minister should see how committed we be in office because give more than billion pound to manchester for that scheme and for set it up indeed the national audit office recently praise our bus fare scheme say it achieve its aim to make bus journey more affordable for low income household and to increase bus usage would not stand there so proud of oversee mile few travel by bus under the conservative party move to the matter of concessionary travel let begin by recognise the strength of support for new clause in the party of the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon although the intention of that amendment and other on concessionary travel be understandable the encts cost around million annually so any extension of statutory entitlement must be carefully consider to ensure financial sustainability have receive good outcome from the bus funding in this spending round we will shortly make multi year allocation to local authority to support bus service locally the multi year nature of these allocation will enable local authority to plan their bus service with great certainty and negotiate the good value provision from bus operator local authority already have the power to offer additional concession beyond the statutory scheme fund locally for example in the year end march of travel concession authority offer concessionary travel to companion of disabled people would also note that review of the enct be conduct under the previous government in include consideration of travel time and we be currently review this for next step on the matter of travel for police officer many operator already offer free travel to police officer we be discuss with the industry how we can build on that offer and increase awareness give the importance of safety on bus this work be be lead by the confederation of passenger transport and would be more than happy to meet the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler to discuss that far it be good news that of local authority recognise the importance of companion bus pass for those disabled people who can not otherwise use bus but give the lack of logic of give somebody pass that they can not use be this not one of those case that ought to be take away from discretion and simply add to statute as matter of common sense we believe in pass the power and the funding down to local area to make these decision multi year funding settlement have be reach and detail of that will be provide to local authority in due course they already have the power and they will have the funding and the ability to do just that thank the right hon member for basildon and billericay and the hon member for broadland and fakenham for table amendment the bill seek to remove the exist requirement for local transport authority that be not mayoral combined authority or mayoral combine county authority to gain the secretary of state consent to start the franchising process this be purely administrative step and have no effect it occur before franchising assessment have be produce so the secretary of state have no evidence at all on whether to support or block move towards franchising the bill purpose be to help streamline and simplify bus franchising and in turn open up the option of bus franchising to all local transport authority clause be consistent with that aim it put all local transport authority on level playing field and will speed up the process for those authority pursue bus franchising for this reason would ask that the amendment be withdraw will now address amendment table by the hon member for wimbledon and for brighton pavilion siân berry and amendment from the right hon member for basildon and billericay and the hon member for broadland and fakenham together be aware of the recent campaign by the hon member for wimbledon regard noise nuisance on the bus network and can confirm that the government be commit to tackle antisocial behaviour on bus include headphone dodge in committee outline the exist regulation in place which set out the behaviour expect of driver and passenger travel on bus so will not repeat they here far to those exist power clause of the bill provide scope to tackle broad range of antisocial behaviour and that could include make byelaw to tackle disruptive form of behaviour of course conservatives members would know this if they have bother to read the bill but they obviously have not notice this when they be talk to the press about headphone dodge as such these amendment be not necessary and would ask right hon and hon member not to press they move next to the issue of fare cap the previous government leave no funding to maintain any form of cap beyond we step in with cap to avoid cliff edge and to ensure that fare remain affordable the fare cap capture around one fifth of bus fare this reflect passenger use of other form of ticketing such as weekly season ticket as result of the recent spending review funding have be secure so that authority can provide target intervention if they so choose school only service be fully consider when design the fare cap scheme and it be determined that they should not be include on amendment the bill introduce socially necessary local service as measure the fare cap end in december prior to this measure come into force the expectation be that it will take some time for local transport authority to identify socially necessary local service in their area an evaluation of the fare cap have already be publish by the department for transport it look at the first month of the previous fare cap evidence suggest that the scheme deliver low value for money the minister make an interesting point early about allow local transport authority and mayor to make decision when it come to bus why do he think that national mandatory bus fare cap should apply but not national mandate allow access for disability pass why be it that some decision should be take locally and other nationally and how do he reconcile those difference thank the hon gentleman for his intervention the national fare cap have be successful we continue to expand it to ensure that it be affordable across the board hear what he say but go back to my point we be give local area the power to do exactly what he be talk about we be undertake an evaluation of the bus fare cap the outcome will be know in the come year hope hon member will withdraw the amendment do the minister agree that the fare cap be an essential lifeline for people take the bus from burnley to blackburn hospital which be service that manage to secure through work with local transit company and lancashire county council completely agree and unlike the conservatives we actually get it fund thank hon member for the new clause and amendment on the provision of socially necessary service clause require area with enhance partnership scheme to specify process that will apply when local transport authority want to change or cancel socially necessary local service in franchising area exist legislation and measure contain in the bill set out detailed procedure govern change to franchising scheme that include change to service specify in scheme careful consideration have be give to the bill measure ensure that there be an appropriate balance between consultation and burden be place on local transport authority the consultation requirement propose by new clause would be duplicative on amendment when the bill be debate in the other place my noble friend the minister for rail make statement to the house to officially confirm that medical and educational establishment come within the definition of essential good and service my department be also produce bespoke guidance for lta which will emphasise that point the desire effect of amendment be already sufficiently cover by the transport act on amendment follow the spending review settlement lta will be allocate significant amount of support through the bus fund to decide where they can invest in their service my department have commit to ensure that funding be fairly allocate the amendment run contrary to the government aim amendment be contrary to the government view that local leader be well place to make decision on how they spend their funding restrict the range of choice for how local authority do that would therefore go against the spirit of the bill on amendment the department already publish bus datum through the bus open datum service that provide timetable bus location and fare datum for local bus service across england the department also publish bus statistic through the majority of the statistic be update annually with information on bus fare make available quarterly provide further information directly to parliament be therefore not necessary amendment would create practical challenge and may not provide the benefit the hon member for brighton pavilion siân berry be seek the need of community evolve over time service that previously run may have be integrate into other bus network through change intend to make the bus route well reflect current need also note that the amendment do not work because an operator can not amend or cancel an already cancel service for the reason have outline ask hon member to withdraw those amendment amendment table by the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler with the support of the hon member for brighton pavilion and for south devon caroline voaden would include training on domestic abuse as define in the domestic abuse act in the mandatory training for bus staff on crime and antisocial behaviour the hon member for wimbledon table the same amendment in committee in committee say that clause capture domestic abuse because it be already criminal offence however must clarify that there be no specific criminal offence of domestic abuse under exist legislation if someone commit criminal offence and that behaviour also satisfy the definition of domestic abuse under section of the act it be treat as an aggravating factor in the commission of the underlie offence and that can also be consider during sentencing the definition of abusive behaviour in the act include physical or sexual abuse violent or threaten behaviour control or coercive behaviour economic abuse and psychological emotional and other abuse the measure in the bill already account for abusive behaviour that be also criminal offence however that be unlikely to be the case for part of the definition from the act namely economic abuse or psychological and emotional abuse which may not be criminal offence those abusive behaviour be less likely to be apparent and do not consider it reasonable to expect bus staff to be able to identify instance of such behaviour in the course of their duty should an incident escalate to criminal offence that would cause victim or potential victim to fear for their personal safety it would be cover under the bill for those reason ask the hon member for wimbledon to withdraw amendment on minimum service level thank the hon member for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff and my hon friend the member for heywood and middleton north mrs blundell for table new clause and respectively and those who sponsor the new clause also thank my hon friend the member for shrewsbury julia buckley always look forward to her reminder about sunday service in shrewsbury and hope that those day be number give the bill progress the bill will empower local area across the country include by give they the tool to decide where to run service and their frequency the government expect local transport authority to consider the transport need of everyone in their area include those in more rural part as set out in the transport act clarify for the hon member for north east hertfordshire that section of that act require an lta to develop policy that meet the transport need of person live work visit or travel in the authority area if an area choose to franchise its bus service it must consider lot of factor to determine the right level of service need to support its community that level be likely to be different in different area similarly when an lta consider an enhanced partnership lot of work be undertake to understand the service level that the local area require and it will then work with operator to investigate how good to proceed interruption believe that be be hasten on hon member more have never be so popular finally let address the amendment on zero emission bus in develop the bill we have take into account the need to provide the industry with sufficient notice before the measure come into effect and with reassurance that it will not happen suddenly we have also consider the impact on bus manufacturer significantly early date could impact on bus operator and passenger the cost of decarbonise soon could lead to reduce service increase fare and an increase in car use with that bring my remark to an end thank member for their contribution question put and agree to new clause accordingly read second time and add to the bill new clause extend eligibility for disabled bus pass the secretary of state must remove the time restriction on the use of concessionary travel pass for disabled people within the english national concessionary travel scheme tom gordon this new clause would require the secretary of state to remove time restriction on the use of disabled concessionary travel pass bring up and read the first time question put that the clause be read second time the result of the division be as

and for correct the record hereby direct the clerks to correct the number and confirm that the ayes be and the noes be third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time this government believe that reliable affordable and accessible transport be not simply luxury to be enjoy by some but that it should be everyone right to access essential service travel to work or school fulfil aspiration and expand horizon today we take step close to that vision because after year of fail deregulation see service cut route ax and fare rise we be finally take our lifeline bus service off of life support this vital legislation usher in the big change to our bus in generation it mean improve service for passenger and protection for socially necessary route green bus will be roll out fast accessibility and safety standard will be raise across the board and bus will be integrate across local transport so that it be easy and simple to get around ultimately this bill be about where power lie it transfer control away from private interest and towards the public good and away from central government and towards the local leader who know their area well they and they alone will choose how good to meet local transport need be it through franchising enhance partnership or locally own bus company my message to the public be simple bus will get well thank hon member for the scrutiny and support they have provide throughout the bill passage specifically recognise opposition members include the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew and the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler for hold the government to account and for their consider questioning it have be respectful and constructive process which must say have be refreshing many of the measure in the bill build on the national bus strategy which know the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden play role in implement particularly in greater manchester also thank the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood for his excellent work and dedication in steer the bill through the house know that the genesis of the bill stretch back long time so also acknowledge the passion and foresight of my predecessor my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh in make the case for the bill and her advocacy for well bus network for all finally madam deputy speaker be grateful to all the parliamentary staff include the clerks and chairs as well as to my official who have work at pace to help deliver this landmark legislation bus connect we to the thing that matter most yet for too long they have be symbol of decline that change now after commit substantial funding for bus service we be now get on with fundamental reform fix the fault of the industry transfer power to the local level and put passenger and local community first change be come to our bus commend the bill to the house call the shadow secretary of state what bus passenger really want be reliable affordable and cheap bus travel on grow network that be what be guarantee under the last conservative government fare cap it be commitment in our manifesto and one that work interruption opposition members may jeer but the national audit office say they might want to listen in praise of the dft that the dft bus fare cap achieve its aim to make bus journey more affordable for low income household and to increase bus usage that be policy abandon by labour but stand up for by the conservatives this labour government scrap it and they keep on pretend that increase to be actually beneficial to taxpayer there be zero indication of how the bill will improve passenger number or ensure rural coverage indeed the bill create an even more fragmented and inconsistent service across the country labour have scrap national fare cap and fail to replace it properly and now it expect local council to pick up the bill without any extra funding the last conservative government deliver real investment for passenger back bus service and improvement in the west midland and greater manchester with billion be there with mayor burnham and anyone would think it be all down to he be sure minister be find deal with andy as interesting as do we also do so in west yorkshire deliver bus service improvement plan and work with local authority to get real result the bill be the opposite of that it will drown council in process drive up cost and threaten rural connectivity while ignore what passenger really need without significant subsidy council will naturally prioritise city and town over village leave our rural community even far behind just as we have see in our court and our prison the government risk create yet another two tier system this time for bus where city region be support and everyone else be simply forget how else to explain force operator towards zero emission bus registration without any plan to help make that transition for they after hammer rural community with attack on family farm the government will do exactly the same all over again with reduce service because they be not provide extra funding to make matter bad they be undermine the very infrastructure that bus rely on by cut road fund in road investment strategy by in real term and delay or cancel critical project the government can not promise well bus service while cut the very road that they and all other user depend on in tear up the safeguard around the secretary of state oversight ministers be give council free rein to set up municipal bus company without ministerial sign off or competitive tendering let be absolutely clear if those company fail the responsibility lie squarely with the secretary of state with taxpayer leave to pick up the bill moreover the bill have completely ignore the shortage of bus and coach driver across our country we have call time and again for and year old to be allow to drive bus beyond km day fifteen month ago the consultation end this government have have month yet last week in answer to write parliamentary question they say that they be still consider their response to the consultation it be straightforward and common sense change that would help tackle driver shortage boost business and tourism and get more bus back on our road the prime minister and his chancellor have tell this house repeatedly that they will pursue growth by any mean necessary yet when an opportunity clearly present itself as this have do they do not seem to want to move at all in this week of hugely damaging and disruptive strike in our nation capital we will see further bus strike across the country next week the government be put ideology ahead of delivery and siding with the union over passenger with bill that fail bus user fail rural community and fail to guarantee value for taxpayer that be why we on the conservative benches will vote against the bill tonight and urge all hon member to do the same call the liberal democrat spokesperson my party support this bill after decade of failure with the deregulation orchestrate by the tories this be clearly move in the right direction it be not ambitious enough and regret deeply your failure to reinstate the bus fare cap the failure to remove the time limit on concessionary travel for disabled people and your failure to address the hon gentleman have repeatedly use the word you and yours throughout this afternoon proceeding please can he do well and the government failure to address the awful scourge of headphone dodger most fundamentally the bill will not work unless it be properly fund at the moment it be not and the government can not hide behind localism when it need proper funding however we will support the bill

future of the minor injury unit at mount vernon hospital be particularly grateful to the minister who despite represent bristol constituency have great deal of knowledge of my area have grow up in it and to the secretary of state for number of conversation that have recognise that the loss of such unit run contrary to the year plan set out to the house it would have much broad impact beyond the hillingdon hospital nhs foundation trust which be the overarch nhs body for both the mount vernon hospital and the hillingdon hospital site to the south that be reflect in the fact that more than people have sign my petition express concern about the loss of the service and call for an opportunity to think again place on record my thank to the members of parliament in number of neighbouring constituency who have support with that petition and support their local resident the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell who be present have maintain the long tradition of hillingdon mp work together on issue that affect their constituency my neighbour in harrow east hertsmere south west hertfordshire south buckinghamshire and harrow west have all express similar view

for old resident particularly if they be not in the good of health and perhaps not up to the journey to an department many of which be under significant pressure minor injury unit be the place to be know the secretary of state and ministers have respond very positively to the plea of number of member across the house who have ask for the prospect of minor injury unit opening to serve their constituency as part of the year plan so to see one lose that be already provide good service seem to great shame the minister will know that the hillingdon hospital nhs foundation trust have be financially challenge for many year indeed during my day as non executive director of the hillingdon primary care trust in the day of the last labour government the overspend be significant it be challenge that have persist to this day under government of all party despite numerous initiative to try to resolve it that be reflect in the poor state of the main hospital building which be pende rebuild should declare for the record that my wife be doctor in that building know the minister and the government have accept the programme of work set in place previously which be grant planning permission by the local authority and announce under the last government to provide new district general hospital at hillingdon be sure the minister will know because of her local knowledge that we need to recognise that hillingdon serve heathrow airport as well as the normal district hospital population the airport have very large population of transitory people come through it many of whom be take ill and add to the pressure on in addition we have the large number of asylum seeker per capita of any local authority in the country and significant number of people in immigration detention pende deportation this be not just hospital serve the normal day to day need of the population area it have particular and unique pressure and minor injury unit be mean of begin to take off some of that pressure for the benefit of local resident my constituency neighbour perfectly describe the very difficult situation in hillingdon inherit by the trust leadership and this government such as the hotel open under the conservatives put pressure on the local system be pleased that the government have commit to close hotel across the country and deal with this issue and be review the fair funding of local authority that be much overdue in hillingdon the hon gentleman describe the situation in hillingdon hospital with the need for rebuild after year with no funding again be pleased that the minister who know hillingdon very well be sure that do not influence the decision finally provide the almost billion that the hospital need do the hon gentleman agree that those be positive step forward agree that the decision on mount vernon hospital be concern and have raise those concern with the trust executive leadership myself do he agree that there have be positive step forward on those long term issue and that we need to continue to work together to improve neighbourhood healthcare be grateful that my constituency neighbour be here have he the same degree of history in hillingdon as myself and the right hon member for hayes and harlington be sure he would recall that the hotel be set up and open as part of dispersal programme start under the labour government in the and lead by andy burnham who be now the mayor of greater manchester know that have place ongoing pressure on the local area but the number of people put into that initial accommodation who be now stick locally be very large be sure the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales share my concern that under the recent announcement about local authority funding hillingdon remain broadly the same as it always have be but welcome his commitment to carry on the work start under the previous government for the rebuild of hillingdon hospital know the right hon member for hayes and harlington will be very aware that the work undertake on sewerage and electronic for that new build over the last few year have present significant challenge to resident in access the hospital be sure his constituent complain about it as much as mine have do indeed the challenge that will come during the rebuilding process of the hospital on what be currently its car park be further argument for why minor injury unit be important in this period it create bit of additional capacity to help with potentially challenging time at and the difficult logistical challenge of access hospital whose car park be already constrain and will be the building site for new hospital all those be additional reason why minor injury unit remain important it be noteworthy in this context that the move away from an open access unit to appointment only which take place follow covid have significantly reduce the footfall at the mount vernon unit and have drive up the cost per visit compare with the previous position this be part of pattern that we have also see in the harrow part of my constituency at the pinn medical centre where the loss of walk in facility have lead to more patient attend the local to long wait and ultimately to increase cost to the nhs because attendance be more expensive than nurse lead walk in service such as that which be available at mount vernon the minister know all this personally she know how much value the local community not just in hillingdon not just in ruislip northwood and pinner but across north west london and into neighbour buckinghamshire and hertfordshire place on that service and how often members of parliament represent place like watford and the harrow constituency have be in touch to share their concern about the delay and challenge face by patient attend in watford hillingdon or northwick park which be the main destination for alternative treatment congratulate my hon friend on secure this adjournment debate he have highlight the issue in his constituency and he be lucky enough that hillingdon hospital be go to be refurbish give the delay to the watford general refurbishment where spade will not be in the ground until at the early do he agree that mount vernon be even more critical for the surround area with the capacity that it provide be grateful to my hon friend another constituency neighbour for the support that he have lend to this campaign on behalf of his constituent in busy capital city where there be all kind of challenge arise not just from the airport but from our transport link the pressure on some of those be high than the nhs funding formula have traditionally recognise and service such as minor injury unit have come into be over the year to make sure that that provision be there know that my constituency neighbour constituent attend mount vernon not just to go to the minor injury unit it be also home to cancer centre hospice private hospital general practitioner whole variety of nhs and private healthcare service as well as to research and scanning and nurse accommodation all those thing be incredibly important to the local community my ask of the minister be straightforward she understand as well as we all do that the nhs be always under financial pressure regardless of which party be in government and she understand personally how much this unit at mount vernon hospital matter to local people across an area that be much wide than that serve solely by the hillingdon hospital nhs foundation trust she also understand that the vision of the year plan put great emphasis on out of hospital care the commitment to the northwood and pinner cottage hospital start under the previous government and now under construction at the site in my constituency be an example of the willingness of both this government and the previous one to invest in those type of service it therefore seem perverse to be close down one such service that be already successfully in operation and that be both value and have the potential to far reduce the cost and service pressure on our local nhs ask the minister simply to intervene with the trust and to ask her official to engage with it about the wide impact that the closure will have beyond the hillingdon hospital trust alone from the trust perspective move those staff and that budget on to the main hospital site will improve the look of its bottom line but in the long term it will increase the cost to the nhs for those patient and reduce the quality of the service that they receive will she therefore consider encourage the trust to move back to an open access model as use to operate at the site which would far reduce the number of visit which be costly to the nhs and stressful and time consume for patient will she confirm to the house that she note the concern that have be express so profoundly and across party by mp from hertsmere beaconsfield south west hertfordshire east harrow and hayes and harlington some of whom have take the time even during tube strike to be present for this debate to demonstrate the importance that they place on it some have say that the more than local people who sign the petition be express faux outrage those people value the service many of they include myself have use it over the year we know the benefit that it bring we know that it be in accordance with this government vision and strategy for the nhs we know that use properly it can reduce cost to the nhs and improve the quality of service not just for my constituent but for all our constituent will the minister please intervene ask the trust to think again and find way to secure this value service for the future for local resident be grateful to the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds for secure this debate he mention that his wife work in the system so pay tribute to she for her service in the local trust as the hon gentleman allude to be hillingdon girl it be where be bring up my brother be bear in hillingdon hospital some year ago it be great pleasure to be there recently with my hon friend the member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales some year ago predict that we might have labour mp there so after be around the area for long time be personally very pleased to see that the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner tempt to move into the wide area of what be rightly to ing and fro ing on some of the big pressure in that part of north west london and into hertfordshire will not go into that but it be absolutely right that hon member use this platform to share their campaigning on behalf of their constituent service change such as these be always hard and they be rarely popular have be the member of parliament for bristol south for more than decade and before that be an nhs manager so have see many service change and reconfiguration over the year like the hon gentleman be also non executive director in past life all the change that have see be do through good consultation with strong clinical leadership and good clinical case and involve patient and the public strongly believe that patient public and staff be often ahead of the wide system and sometimes of politician in know the balance of the money the funding the good value for taxpayer money clinical outcome and safety if they be manage well those conversation and the sort of debate we be have tonight can often yield well result than maintain the status quo or decision make behind closed door be familiar with such debate as like many of we often find myself stand where the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner be advocate for my constituent against change that think be not in their good interest or not clearly communicate he be right to secure this debate agree with every word that the minister have say about how we get good decision in the interest of local people but do she share my concern that there have be no public consultation about this decision at all there have be very limited engagement even with local resident association about the process and for the staff involve there have be some shall we say degree of ambiguity about what decision have be make at each stage of the process do she agree that it would be wise at this stage as very minimum to pause to think again and to undertake that public consultation so that the nhs manager task with make the decision fully understand the impact on the local community will comment on that later understand that there be meeting on friday to which will allude in prepare for the debate meet representative of the trust and be grateful to those in the local nhs for their time in give some further background the trust be clear that it would be more efficient for urgent care service to be consolidate at the site in hillingdon bring forward the urgent care nurse practitioner service at mount vernon into the urgent treatment centre at hillingdon hospital the rationale for have urgent treatment centre alongside be well establish clinically the hon gentleman reference the year plan be pleased he be such fan and the direction of travel be pleased to say that the trust also believe that people be well serve by primary care hub so that more responsive care can be deliver close to where people live three such hub be be develop in hillingdon one of which will be in ruislip be sure that he welcome the announcement this week of the roll out of the first of the hub include the one in hillingdon which will deliver the neighbourhood health service model despite some of the heat in the debate the misquoting of thing that have be say and the unfortunate politicisation of this important local issue about which there be general agreement among member of all party and in the community the consensus that hear be that people want more accessible service more locally there be need for three hub the system want that and be pleased that the government have announce funding and prioritise hillingdon have also hear that there be potentially great role for community pharmacy in provide urgent service and care do the minister agree that more can be do by primary care provider across the board in hillingdon and elsewhere agree with my hon friend that that be the direction of travel that we want to see in all of our constituency across the country the long promise rebuild of hillingdon hospital will be deliver by this government as part of wave of the new hospital programme the money be guarantee and construction will start between and we be already help the trust to prepare for when we get spade in the ground and it be pleasure to visit the trust recently with my hon friend the member for uxbridge and south ruislip the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner raise the issue of consultation understand that there be meeting with the trust the integrate care board and the local authority on friday and be sure that he and other hon member will be part of that it be entirely proper for member of parliament to raise issue about change in their area that be part of our democracy and democratic accountability now that this government have put the new hospital programme in order it be also proper for the house to hold we to account on its progress will try to attend the meeting on friday but the minister must appreciate that there be an element of scepticism about the future in particular about what be happen with this unit it confirm in my mind that if you stand still long enough thing will come around time and again in our constituency in hillingdon we have go from cottage hospital that provide immediate care for minor injury as well as have bed which be close to be promise darzi unit which we never see to look forward to the hub themselves on friday want to be able to convince people that there be comprehensive plan that will be hold to and properly invest in because people will be very sceptical about the closure of unit without the confidence that the architecture will be in place to meet the need of our constituent the petition have garner such large number of signature because of that concern understand what the right hon gentleman say have see some of those promise make and not deliver over many year it be important that members of parliament be involve and that there be wide conversation with the icb and the trust around those change and the development that they make towards deliver the year plan my right hon friend the prime minister announce that we would bring together nhs england and the department for health and social care precisely because we think that democratic accountability for billion of taxpayer money be important however that accountability do not mean micromanage or intervene in every difficult decision that the icb make we expect local nhs organisation to make change and to reconfigure their service as well need by the people they serve that be in line with the direction outline in the year plan my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care have receive several request to intervene on number of issue have look at they thoroughly and assure himself that patient safety and access be guard he have decide not to intervene in nine reconfiguration get our nhs back on its foot be team effort and we have to trust local nhs leader to deliver decision that affect the people of hillingdon should be make in hillingdon it be not for someone sit behind desk in whitehall to make those decision for they have say that want to assure colleague that that do not mean we will give local leader blank cheque to do whatever they like yesterday we publish data tool and league table that make nhs performance open and accessible to inspire improvement and deliver well nhs for all those nhs organisation that be do well will be reward with great freedom such as in how to spend their capital and those that demonstrate the good financial management will get great share of capital allocation we want to move towards system in which freedom be the norm and central grip be the exception in order to challenge poor performance improve service for patient should be reward the quid pro quo be that there will be no more reward for failure undertake the reform we have set out to make as government will require good deal of trust between central government and local leader and we will build that trust only by show those local leader that we trust they to get on with the job and make difficult decision where necessary will the minister give way be go to pursue this point if may debate about service change and reconfiguration have go on since the birth of our nhs understand that they be really important for local people and understand the level of discussion about this issue and as the hon gentleman have outline the wide impact on area such as watford it would be easy for this government to make ourselves popular by sack some manager and promise people that service be never go to change or that they will never close in any part of the country but we be not elect on populist platform and it would not be in patient long term interest not to reform and modernise the system we be build an nhs that be fit for the future that be what the year long term plan be base on move service from hospital into the community from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention we expect local nhs leader to make that happen they must do so with local clinical leadership in the good interest of the population they serve and they must do it with the public we expect open and transparent communication go forward local politician have an important role in that which member present in the chamber have demonstrate ably and will continue to do so would be very happy to maintain contact with the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner the wide implication of the issue he have raise need to be outline to he and commit to write back to he about the consideration that be be give to those wide implication note his concern and be happy to continue work with he question put and agree to house adjourn
