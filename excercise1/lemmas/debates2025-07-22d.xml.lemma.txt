department be take to tackle health inequality across the country what step his department be take to tackle health inequality across the country the drive force behind this government approach to health be the principle that whoever person be and whatever their background they should receive the same world class service as everyone else base on need and not the ability to pay that be why at its core our year plan for health look to stamp out health inequality free up billion to move critical resource such as medicine and equipment to the region and patient that need they most only labour

to see the innovative work that be already be undertake and to discuss how the reform will support health outcome in the most deprive area can certainly give my hon friend that commitment the damage that be wreak by the previous government not just across our health service but across every other part of government mean that the gap between the health of the poor part of our country and that of the wealthy have widen enormously we have see real challenge in general practice which be why there be more patient per gp in the poor community compare with the rich and that particularly affect rural and coastal community with high level of deprivation we be go to carry out review of the carr hill formula that formula have to work for general practice and would be delighted to come and see the work that the team at carn to coast be do in kensington and bayswater there be now staggering year gap in life expectancy between man live in notting dale and those live in holland park which be just hundred of metre apart and that gap have grow in recent year the minister know that this be whole of society issue to do with housing employment and education but can he outline what step the department be take to help inner city area with very high level of health inequality such as that experience by my constituent in kensington be grateful to my hon friend for point out those stark difference in healthy life expectancy within single inner london borough that contain some of the rich people on earth as well as some of the poor in our country as for what we be do as government in addition to make sure that funding follow need and that we be tackle deprivation our approach to neighbourhood health should make sure that we be work proactively in those community that have the high level of need include pocket of deprivation within area of high affluence of course as our plan recognise and as our mission drive approach address there be so many social determinant of ill health include poverty lack of good work damp housing dirty air and an inability to access culture and leisure opportunity that be affordable for everyone not just the privileged few those be the issue that this government be address consistent with the labour value that get we elect for resident of new court place care home in borehamwood wheelchair be their lifeline however they be be badly let down by ajm healthcare their nhs wheelchair provider with multiple unresolved assessment bad communication and waiting time for repair and replacement unbelievably extend to four year resident with physical and intellectual disability feel let down overlook and traumatise in tackle health inequality can urge the secretary of state to look urgently at this provider and come to the aid of people who desperately need our help can certainly give the right hon gentleman the assurance that my department will look into the provider that he raise one reason be proud that this government increase the disabled facility grant be that it mean not just more ramp handrail and accessible kitchen and bathroom but dignity independence freedom and quality of life that be precisely what the right hon gentleman constituent be be deprive of if they do not have wheelchair that meet their need would be delighted to look into this and be extremely angry that the failure he raise require to do so do the secretary of state agree that public health be at the heart of address the long list of inequality he have just highlight be deeply concerned that major reorganisation of local government and the cutting of budget to the integrate care board will undermine the co ordination that currently exist in oxfordshire to deliver public health can the secretary of state assure and my constituent that public health will continue to be priority at the heart of the prevention strategy and that funding for public health will rise in future year to make that possible can certainly give the hon gentleman reassurance that the work we be do to streamline and rationalise the amount of money we be spend on nhs bureaucracy mean that we will free up resource that can be spend on the frontline improve patient care and public health thank to the decision take by my department the deputy prime minister and of course my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer investment in public health be rise and the spending power of local authority be improve that be all good news for public health call the shadow minister tackle health inequality require strong workforce recently meet constituent who be about to qualify as nurse but she have be unable to find work she be not alone this be widespread problem the reason she have be give include recruitment freeze to save money and nurse bring in from overseas instead we need more nurse to tackle health inequality so will the secretary of state ensure that trust be fund to support and employ new nurse and to prioritise british nurse for british job can certainly assure the shadow minister that the chief nursing officer and be work proactively to deal with nursing unemployment we be also work with the leadership of the nhs to make sure that we be reduce our reliance on overseas worker grateful though be to all the healthcare worker who come from overseas to work in our health and care service the service would fall over tomorrow if they all leave so we should be extremely grateful there be certainly an overreliance and that be what we be address have to say to the shadow minister though that both those issue be result of appal workforce planning for which the previous government bear huge amount of responsibility neighbourhood health services what step his department be take to support neighbourhood health service it be only with proper investment and reform that we will bring care close to people home and into the community our year health plan will roll out neighbourhood health service in every community as one stop shop for health and care service that meet the need of local population include rural and coastal community like my hon friend constituency the previous government fail to move care into the community we have already hit the ground run on deliver the year health plan and launch the national neighbourhood health implementation programme on july to start that work at pace my constituent in barrow and furness very much welcome the government move towards deliver more neighbourhood health service but my right hon friend will be aware of the great concern locally about the proposal from lancashire and south cumbria integrate care board to permanently end level critical care at furness general hospital more than people have sign my petition just this week to oppose that move will the secretary of state please ensure that decision maker meet and representative locally to explore an alternative path forward that ensure patient safety protect the integrity of our hospital and reflect the area grow population that be just one of many instance in which my hon friend have make the voice and view of people across barrow and furness hear loudly and clearly in this place and across government in response to her question say yes absolutely on such an important matter her local commissioner should be meet she as the local member of parliament and think can commit to that on their behalf while such decision must be make locally and clinically lead they must also be make in partnership with the local authority and the local community we must ensure that we be engage democratically elect representative and will ensure that my hon friend secure that meeting my constituent in cranleigh have no train service and no direct bus service to the royal surrey county hospital in guildford which be big issue for old resident who do not drive do the secretary of state agree that some of the empty room in cranleigh village hospital could provide very good opportunity for the expansion of neighbourhood health service and if he have not be brief on this pressing issue by his official may brief he or one of his ministers on it in the autumn that sound like another bid for neighbourhood health centre in the right hon gentleman constituency but be sure that local commissioner will be delighted to hear the case he have make give the experience that he bring to bear industrial action what assessment he have make of the potential impact of industrial action on nhs service before this government come to office strike be cripple the nhs cost run to billion in just one year and patient see million appointment reschedule strike this week be not inevitable and sincerely hope that the british medical association will postpone this action in order to continue the constructive talk that my team and have have with its representative in recent day our priority be to keep patient safe regardless and we will do everything we can to mitigate the impact on they and the disruption that will follow should these totally unnecessary and avoidable strike go ahead in previous role find that health worker take industrial action only in extreme circumstance so agree with the secretary of state that if the strike can be prevent they should be during previous resident doctor strike elective or scheduled procedure be usually postpone or plan to be postpone to free up senior doctor to cover their work but note that the chief executive of nhs england have instruct hospital to continue those procedure have the secretary of state make any assessment of the impact that would have not just on patient but on the staff who would have to remain the approach we be take be different from that take during previous period of strike action nhs leader have make it clear to that those early strike cause much wide harm than have previously be realise there be no reason why plan care appointment relate to cancer for example as well as other condition should be treat as be less important than or play second fiddle to other nhs service that be why the chief executive of nhs england have write to nhs leader ask they to keep routine operation go to the full extent possible as well as continue priority treatment it will be for local leader to determine what be possible give staffing level which be why it be so important for resident doctor to engage with their employer about their determination or not to turn up at work this week and why must again spell out the serious consequence for patient should these avoidable and unnecessary strike go ahead healthcare assistant at blackpool teaching hospital nhs foundation trust have be underpaid on the wrong band for year but the trust have consistently fail to put that right and as result staff have be leave with no choice but to be ballot for strike action by unison from today healthcare assistant play vital role in our nhs but be it any wonder that they often feel undervalued and demoralise when they be not pay the correct rate for the duty that they undertake do the secretary of state agree that blackpool healthcare assistant be worth just as much as those in the rest of the north west and that the trust should pay up now should declare that be member of unison the issue that my hon friend raise be serious one we obviously do not want to see strike action impact on her local constituent and my department will do everything we can to help bring an end to the dispute will make more general point these sort of choice and trade off about resource be precisely why the bma resident doctor have receive pay rise from this government in the last year ought to remember the responsibility that and they have to some of their lower pay colleague resource be finite and it be important that act in the interest of all nhs staff and have particular concern for those who work extremely hard but be not properly reward call the shadow secretary of state the resident doctor strike be unnecessary irresponsible and wrong recently and again today from the dispatch box the secretary of state have be resolute in not give in to the bma resident doctor committee demand although do not know the detail of the current status of his discussion with the committee may encourage he to remain firm in his stance and while be fair to doctor to always ensure that he put the interest of patient and taxpayer first once again the house be speak with one voice and hope that the bma understand the strength of feeling on both side of the house about the unnecessary and irresponsible nature of the propose strike action this week discussion in recent day have be constructive and hope that give ground for the postponement of strike action so that we can work together to avert it not just this

area instead of just make it bad when this labour government come to office we promise million more appointment but we have actually deliver million we have cut nhs waiting list month after month and they be now at their low level in two year of course there be more to do regret that we have to delay watford general hospital the previous government leave plan that be not credible and have no available funding we be clean up their mess and the hon member have cheek to complain about it the report barrier for adult with cerebral palsy on achieve full life participation publish by the former all party parliamentary group on cerebral palsy highlight the cliff edge in support for those with cerebral palsy when they transition at the age of and the need to end the separation of neuro and musculoskeletal knowledge within the nhs give that cerebral palsy be neuromusculoskeletal condition and that those live with it need easy and ready access to both area would therefore be grateful if

initial action the proportion of dentist work in the nhs in norfolk and waveney continue to drop be pleased to hear about the government work on the dental contract but the public accounts committee be clear that this will work only if it be back by sustainable funding will give the minister another chance to answer the question will the government ensure that the extra funding that have be put into the department be actually reflect in extra funding for nhs dentistry one thing that make clear to official when come into this post be that every penny that be allocate to nhs dentistry must be spend on nhs dentistry we be in crazy situation where demand for nhs dentistry be go through the roof yet we have have underspend that need to stop we will focus the spending on where it be most need include area that be under serve such as the hon gentleman constituency my constituent marie brewis and denise coates be bravely use their own experience of breast cancer treatment to campaign for

making and the need to release funding when it be allocate shall make sure that my department look into that and write to he with an answer commend my right hon friend for his work on reduce waiting list but at the homerton in hackney because of system wide funding failure deficit reduction money be remove three month into month agreement which reduce the opportunity to drive down waiting list still far will he or one of his colleague meet to discuss this issue and see what we can do to drive down those waiting list we be take action to deal with the over run of budget and the reckless spending across the nhs and to bring deficit under control but would be delighted to meet my hon friend spelthorne resident emma and john lose holly to cancer in october last year they set up the charity holly heroes in her name before she die holly be give wheelchair by the nhs and emma and john can not now give it back to the nhs for love nor money have raise this with the chief executive of

also say an enormous thank you to holly family for the work they be do in such unimaginable circumstance really admire people who put themselves forward to serve other in that way after such painful experience last friday bring together gps housing developer the local authority the icb and anyone else you care to name to try finally to solve the issue of our have one of the most under doctored area in the country for primary care among the many issue raise be particularly niche one thank to nhs property services demand late payment from couple of gp surgery which be unaware that they be due to pay this rent those surgery now face the possibility of have to pay bill that equate to the cost of one gp salary for year that can not be right would be delighted to look at the issue that my hon friend raise be only sorry that miss the party last week lancashire and south cumbria integrate care board be have to make saving of million this year and the backdrop to that be loss of ward at barrow lancaster and kendal we hear lot about additional money for the nhs why be none of it come to cumbria it be not the case that none of the money be go to cumbria we be take action to deal with the persistent overrunning and over spending of nhs budget which be an intolerable situation that we have to get grip on we be invest billion more in the nhs and that will rise over the course of this parliament we will make sure that every part of the country get its fair share not least through the deprivation link funding that mention know that it be bumpy for icb as we get they back to balance but believe it will be worth it in the end when we have sustainable nhs that be fit for the future in consultation be carry out to give prescribing right to operate department practitioner but despite positive discussion with the department we be no far forwards and opd and ally health professional be be hold back do the secretary of state agree that expand their role within scope of practice will improve efficiency patient care and professional development we be keen to address these sort of issue through our workforce planning and to ensure that staff be work to the top of their licensing capability always within the training provide that way we can get the good possible value for taxpayer money and most importantly of all the good outcome for patient do the secretary of state agree with about the importance of step down provision provide by community hospital such as petersfield and alton both for patient care and for relieve pressure on acute hospital such as queen alexandra and basingstoke yes and that be why we be reform the well care fund key to the shift to prevention be make sure that people can stay in their own home or get home from hospital the health and social care committee find that such provision cost the nhs billion every year can the secretary of state update on what we be do to get the social care system work thank to the decision that the chancellor have take spend power in social care be rise not just through department funding but in the spending power of local authority my hon friend be absolutely right we have to get the right care in the right place at the right time that often mean well care for patient and well value for taxpayer at midnight the times publish an article on the me final delivery plan carry quote from three me campaign group the charity action for publish five page briefing at the same time and bbc breakfast also feature the plan so they have all read the plan check with the relevant officer and go to the house of commons library about half an hour ago and no plan have be publish more than hour after the department press release no mp can access the plan be this how it should be thank the hon member for raise this issue that be not what be expect written ministerial statement have be table and will speak to official and make sure that that plan be available as it should be prax lindsey oil refinery urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net zero if he will make statement on the closure of the prax lindsey oil refinery in my oral statement on june inform parliament of the deeply disappointing news that the prax lindsey oil refinery have enter insolvency and that the court have appoint an official receiver to manage the situation on the site and determine the next step since then we have work urgently to ensure the safety of the refinery site and the security of fuel supply and to protect worker that also allow time for bidder to express an interest in the site follow thorough process the official receiver have rigorously assess all the bid receive and conclude that sale of the business as whole be not credible option visit worker at the site on july and will be meet they again shortly today know that this will be hugely disappointing news to they their family and the wide community they be all in my thought at this time package have be offer to all directly employ at the refinery which guarantee their job and pay over the come month alongside the usual support that be offer to workforce in insolvency situation the government will also immediately fund comprehensive training guarantee for those refinery worker to ensure that they have the skill need and the support to find job in for example the grow clean energy workforce furthermore we understand that the official receiver continue to explore various proposal for asset on the site therefore remain hopeful that solution will be find that create future employment opportunity at the immingham site the refinery will continue to process crude for the rest of the month and the official receiver will continue sell refined product for number of week give buyer time to adjust their supply chain the former owner leave the refinery in an untenable position and give the government little time to act that be why the energy secretary immediately demand an investigation into their conduct and the circumstance surround the insolvency and why have repeatedly call on the owner to do the right thing and provide financial support to the workforce at this difficult time call the shadow minister when the prax lindsey refinery close its door in october there will be only four oil refinery remain in the united kingdom follow the news about grangemouth few month ago this be the second oil refinery to close in the united kingdom in only six month prompt serious question about our energy security and resilience in immingham people be wake up today to the reality that redundancy be now inevitable it be estimate that about job will be lose for the community in lincolnshire that be seismic as the minister say we be aware of the long stand financial issue with prax group and reiterate my support for the government investigation into its director what progress have be make on that investigation when do he expect the report to be make we can not escape the fundamental crisis face our manufacturing sector as jim ratcliffe have say the sector be face extinction because of enormously high energy price and crippling carbon tax bill the minister department know that to be true and have exempt some industry from pay the net zero levy recuse specific business from pay the extortionate green subsidy cost that be ridiculous situation that see subsidy be pay by the government to business to exempt they from the charge be impose by that very same government we be truly through the look glass the department be wilfully talk down the oil and gas industry with hostile language and an impossible fiscal regime while oversee the deindustrialisation of the united kingdom through the perpetuated high cost of industrial energy this be not simply manage decline it be accelerate decline drive by ideology and steer from whitehall will the minister tell we what work be be do to ensure the future of the four remain oil refinery in the united kingdom what if any assessment have be make of the uk resilience give the steep reduction in our refining capacity over the past six month what if any assessment have be make of the increase reliance on import that will be necessary as result of the reduction in british refining capacity will he please change course and start speak up for our oil industry upstream and downstream which see from the current government disregard for it its worker and the community that rely most on it agree with the shadow minister who be right to point out the impact that news like this will have on the workforce who be hear it this week as well as the wide impact it have on their family and the community that be why it be so important that we provide that support on the investigation there be not much that can update the house on at the moment the insolvency service be carry out that investigation and it would be wrong for minister to interfere in that but we have obviously give the direction that we expect it to be complete as quickly as possible give the mess we find the company in would not be surprised if it take bit of time for the investigation to get to grip with what be go on there but that be for the insolvency service to resolve on resilience and fuel supply we have be really clear throughout that we have do everything we can to try to find buyer to keep the site operate as go concern which be important for the workforce as well as for local resilience but prax lindsey oil refinery comprise about of our remain refinery capacity phillips much large refinery be immediately next door in the past few week we have already see fuel supply adjust and commercial contract renegotiate although we clearly want the refinery to stay open our assessment suggest that there be not an immediate risk to fuel supply locally or in the wide area but we will continue to monitor that on the shadow minister wide point will first repeat what have say on number of occasion we do support the oil and gas industry have spend lot of time with the industry understand some of its challenge which be long stand particularly around job lose over the past decade and we consult widely on what the future of energy in the north east should look like to give confidence to the industry we inherit the fiscal regime from the previous government we have consult quickly on what the future of the energy profit levy should look like to ensure certainty about the fiscal landscape the treasury will respond to that consultation in due course we want to give certainty but we also want to recognise that this be an industry in transition and bury our head in the sand and pretend that that be not the case do nothing to protect the workforce in the long term we will therefore continue to invest in the new industry of the future and in that wide strategy refinery be important to our economy and will continue to be important that be why bring all of industry together in roundtable to discuss the challenge face the refinery sector be shock to discover that that be the first time there have be such an invitation from the government in year ask the shadow minister to reflect on who be in power for year call the chair of the energy security and net zero committee the minister be absolutely right so be the shadow minister to focus on the job and the community affect by the worrying news come from lindsey he be also right to say that the problem be the result of shockingly bad management my select committee will look at the future of refining in this country in one off session in the autumn and we will be able to take further evidence at that point in response to what the shadow minister say about energy price will the minister confirm that the way to get industrial energy price down just as with domestic energy price be to reduce our reliance on the volatility uncertainty and high price that be determine by vladimir putin and the petrostate and that we have to manage the transition not shut our eye to it or somehow play into culture war as reform want we to do my hon friend be right separate from all the wide issue face the refinery sector and the oil and gas sector generally it be right we recognise that this week there be worker hear some devastating news detailed work will be go on into how much of the site we can utilise in the future and assessment be under way about how credible some of the bid be we will do more work on that and be sure that his inquiry will be useful on energy cost more generally one of the conversation have when meet the refinery sector be about how we could do more to bring down its cost we be look at how we could support refinery more through include they in the energy intensive industry compensation scheme which would obviously cut cost and help uk refinery with their competitiveness that be not straightforward but we be determined to look at that on my hon friend final point he be right that the overall context of what we be do as government be drive forward the transition to clean power because it give we back our energy security and take away the volatility in price that have be so devastating to household and business over the past few year it be also the economic opportunity that help drive forward refinery into what could be profitable business in that transition they will continue to play part in that and we will support they to do so we have lot of business today so if we could help each other that would be very useful call the liberal democrat spokesperson the closure of prax lindsey oil refinery be deeply troubling with up to job at risk across the supply chain it be devastating blow to worker their family and the community that rely on the refinery we need clear strategy to support those whose livelihood be in jeopardy that mean practical help with reskille and retraining this be also an opportunity for target green investment in industry that can offer decent secure job for the future this crisis speak to wide failure the uk still lack proper plan for just transition that give oil and gas worker real confidence about what come next we need to wind down fossil fuel in way that provide genuine opportunity well pay green job clean energy infrastructure and proper support for the community that have long power this country as other party embrace climate denialism and internet conspiracy theory the liberal democrats call on the government to ensure that we do not backtrack on our climate target undermine green investor confidence and abandon our leadership on the world stage when it come to climate change first what step be the government take to ensure that contingency plan be in place so that those whose job be at risk be guarantee support and opportunity to redeploy their skill secondly how be the government ensure that investment in skill and regeneration be target so that it have the great impact where it be need most finally what step be the government take to ensure that the transition to renewable energy make the good use of the skill and experience of oil and gas worker in the place affect such as the humber estuary write down the hon gentleman point and then he come on to specific question but will respond to the point he rightly say that this have be devastating news for the worker he also say something that want to echo and which say to the worker when meet they last week this decision and what have happen to the company be no reflection at all on the incredible very skilled work that they be do want to reiterate that so often in these case the worker bear the brunt of decision take by the company and that be great shame he be right and we will support the worker my department be fund the training guarantee to make sure that all those worker be give an assessment of their training need and future employment desire so they can be give tailor support we will make sure that be roll out in the come month on the hon gentleman wide point about the transition he be right to say that we need proper plan that be why we consult on the future of energy in the north sea both through series of question and through much broad question about what the future of our energy sector look like it will have oil and gas for many decade to come but already thousand of job be be create in other offshore industry and we want to support that the hon gentleman be right to highlight that investor confidence be critical it be shameful that people would seek to damage investor confidence in this country in the name of net zero rhetoric the truth be that there have be more than billion of investment in clean energy in this country that mean job and opportunity in all our community across the country and those who would talk that down should be ashamed draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests in respect of the gmb trade union the minister say that he be engage with worker will he set out in more detail what engagement he be undertake with the trade union that be those worker representative will he give the house an assurance that the detailed modelling work undertake by the department include the impact on the wide supply chain also declare that be member of the gmb trade union that be record in my entry in the register of members financial interests have engage with both the unite trade union rep who be on the site and with day shift worker who be not represent by trade union to make sure that hear from they meet they early this month and last week at the refinery and will meet they in about an hour time to talk through this more we want to continue that engagement with they call the father of the house obviously my first concern be my constituent who work in the refinery in the neighbouring constituency that of my hon friend the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers be sure that the minister will give they reassurance about enhanced redundancy also may ask question on behalf of my rural constituent in north lincolnshire and declare an interest as live there this be deeply rural area where we rely on heating oil because we be not on main gas what impact will closure of the refinery have on the price of heating oil on redundancy because of how the company go into insolvency the worker will be entitle to statutory redundancy that be not acceptable give the role that they play in deliver for the company for many year that be why have publicly ask the owner of the company to put their hand in their pocket and improve the redundancy package it be not possible for the government to improve the package directly but be still hopeful that the company owner will do the right thing we be provide training guarantee to the worker from government fund to make sure that they have that enhance support be happy to take away the point about heating oil we have be assess the situation over the past few week include number of week during which fuel have not leave the refinery at its normal pace to see what the impact be on supply across the region that impact have be minimal that be partly because significant amount of fuel and product come from the refinery next door however we will continue to monitor that and if there be an impact on price be happy to look into that much like the ceramics sector the refinery sector be an energy intensive industry that be at the mercy of industrial energy price which be beyond its control but have huge impact on its viability it be welcome that the minister think that the energy intensive certification programme could expand to include the refinery sector but he will know that the business level test be huge barrier that need to be overcome it mean that many company will not be eligible for the programme he will also know that the british industry competitiveness scheme be not due to come online for another two year indeed consultation on that scheme have yet to be open refinery and ceramic company be look down the barrel of ever increase industrial energy bill will he give they some indication of what help and support be available now before the new scheme come online so that we do not have more statement about closed factory in the next few month my hon friend be right and it be deeply frustrating that we inherit many of these issue which be unresolved for such long time these be not problem that arrive in the past month bring in the refinery sector for talk with government about the challenge would have be fairly obvious thing to do at least once in the past year clearly that do not occur to the previous government and we have inherit challenge my hon friend be right to say that consultation will take time unfortunately it be right that we conduct proper consultation to make sure that there be not any unintended consequence the minister for industry who be minister in both the department for energy security and net zero and the department for business and trade be look at how we can do that as quickly as possible be happy to follow that up with she my hon friend be also right that nobody want to be talk about redundancy in any part of our economy and we be do everything we can to bring down price to prevent redundancy this be massive blow to my brigg and immingham constituency most particularly to those directly employ by the refinery but also to the wide economy of the sub region will the minister reconsider what he just say about statutory redundancy want the maximum support give to those worker will raise two other point first north lincolnshire council publish green growth zone document last year about the future of the regional economy as we discuss yesterday urge the minister to consider an urgent meeting at which all involve be bring in for roundtable discussion secondly if he be not do so already may urge he to speak to his colleague who be local government minister north lincolnshire council will lose million in business rate needless to say that be massive blow that would affect the delivery of service thank the hon gentleman for his question and for meet to discuss the matter yesterday appreciate the impact that the closure will have not just on those refinery worker who be directly impact but on the wide economy we absolutely appreciate that there be ripple effect from closure like this on the statutory redundancy point we have look at this and have push to see if there be more action that the government can take to change or give additional payment it be not possible for government to do that not least because the insolvency service have to follow specific rule on creditor and how they operate in the event of an insolvency however the owner of the company have profit from this business and they should do the right thing by the workforce that deliver that for they have agree to hold roundtable discussion and previously meet the two council leader to talk about this be happy to arrange that discussion and to have it with whoever be useful and want to participate because the hon gentleman be right about the opportunity be happy to engage on the point about north lincolnshire and business rate although the refinery will not continue to be go concern we be assess bid from those who be interested in the site we hope those bid will deliver job and economic benefit and that business rate income will come from new industry on the site that be not as good as retain the refinery in its current form but we hope we can make some progress thank the minister for his statement and particularly for the news that there will be thorough investigation have two quick question first be the report correct that the previous government do not meet representative of the sector for year know the minister say that he have meet they recently secondly family will be in crisis when they hear this news and they will struggle to deal with it do he agree that the owner who understand be not short of money have an absolute moral obligation to ensure that those family be support statutory payment be welcome but the moral obligation have to be make clear thank my hon friend for both those point my understanding from the sector and from the department be that meeting have not happen in the past year interruption if the right hon member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins on the opposition front bench want to find date when her government meet the sector would be really happy to look at they and at any minute from those meeting that would be helpful there be particular issue for the sector but also for individual refinery some be more profitable than other and some have transition to do other piece of work it be important that they learn from one other and that the government do what they can on my hon friend final point agree that there be moral obligation here have meet the worker on the site know that they have do nothing wrong they have work hard over many year to keep the refinery go and to deliver profit those who have take money out of that business should now do the right thing and fund those worker and hope that they will respond to my letter in due course with the grangemouth refinery in scotland have close and prax lindsey face the same fate there be clearly missing element in the uk government just transition policy there can be no just transition if skilled job be lose when that transition be make what assurance can the minister give that the government have take wide view in order to stem these closure and address what be clearly deep issue with policy take the hon gentleman point about the importance of recognise that the most important thing to get right be the transition of worker have say that in other answer that require we to recognise that transition be under way and to put in place plan which have not happen in the past decade during which we lose more than worker in this industry it be really important that we grapple with those issue and it will not be easy the starting point be to bring together everyone with an interest in this as have do everyone from the trade union and industry to those make the green investment that be drive this forward to make sure that we deliver on job and to make sure that training and support be in place so that worker can transition he raise an important point on the hon gentleman point about grangemouth it be not break news that grangemouth be in precarious position and the previous government could have do more to ensure just transition there meet the investment taskforce yesterday along with my colleague gillian martin the energy minister in the scottish government to look at the prospect for the site there be some interesting proposition come forward there be bid in total for million from the national wealth fund and hope that we will have good news on job and investment in grangemouth soon thank the minister for his briefing yesterday but there be pattern develop be there not some job be create every single day in the year of the conservative government but unemployment have go up every single day under this labour government some plus job have be lose at vivergo on the north side of the humber and perhaps job will be lose directly and other lose indirectly on the south side of the humber can the minister reassure those affect that this government will not destroy our industrial base and that there be future for we because it look like we be head in the wrong direction will avoid the wide political point in week when worker be find out about job loss because that be obviously devastating for they will just say that the government have publish their industrial strategy and this be the first time the country have have an industrial strategy in very long time interruption well let we say credible industrial strategy if the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart think he have one before again ask he to present it to we be invest in the industry of the future and deliver thousand of job on the humber and right across the country we be make sure that investment come forward in job for the future interruption the problem with the right hon gentleman point be that his party oppose that investment it oppose the very thing that will deliver the job of the future and be afraid that be simply an untenable position either he be for or against investment in job he have to say which it be the industrial strategy be the way to deliver that the last time we discuss prax lindsey ask the minister to support my energy job bill plan for the redeployment and retraining of oil and gas worker that be proactive and industry wide rather than reactive and crisis by crisis and that would be pay for by the company that be what the worker and the union want but the minister say he do not agree with it he have now say that the government will fund training guarantee for these refinery worker and be ask this company owner to make voluntary contribution to support worker that be progress but will he now turn this into proactive and industry wide plan and please go beyond ask the company nicely to do the right thing and require it think the hon lady slightly miss the point the company go into insolvency the worker be therefore entitle only to statutory redundancy do not think that that be acceptable so have call not nicely but directly for the owner of that company to do the right thing put their hand in their pocket and fund proper redundancy for those worker that be separate from wide piece of work we be do around the transition think she also miss the point about the importance of deliver investment in oil and gas that be also investment in renewable and in carbon capture utilisation and storage to deliver the job that come next so that there be transition for those worker have say that do not support her proposal and be happy to say that again because it would do neither of those thing it be essential that we support the oil and gas industry in its current form but recognise that it be in transition we still have decade of oil and gas to come in this country but we be already build up the industry that come next that need investment and it also need we to build infrastructure which many people in her party seem to oppose while the minister be right to point out that this refinery produce small amount of the uk refine fuel overall the site do provide around of the fuel into warwickshire oil storage key site at kingsbury in the west midland that supply fuel into the west midland which be obviously very large demand centre what be the minister assessment of the impact on the supply and demand balance of road fuel in the west midland as result of this closure be happy to follow up on anything specific with the hon gentleman but can tell he that get daily update on assessment on exactly that point clearly the first week of the insolvency see some disruption to supply leave but our evidence point to the fact that those commercial contract be able to be renegotiate and to adjust to that we be continue to monitor to ensure there be no disruption and there be no assessment at the moment that would suggest any impact at all on fuel security clearly we will continue to do that and if can follow up on specific will do so what pathetic turnout today from the party of the worker just four labour mp have turn up to speak out on behalf of the prax lindsey worker what want to know from the minister be if it be true that foreign company have already be line up to asset strip and decommission this site yes or no first think the hon gentleman be misjudge the mood of this question which be about worker affect by redundancy hear nothing from he on those worker who be hear the news this week on his point we assess number of bid for the business as go concern none of those bid be credible which be why the official receiver make the decision to cease refining some bid be interested in part of the site for range of different thing but be not party to those bid they be commercially sensitive bid that will be assess on the basis of how many job can be retain and the industrial opportunity on that site which be what we be drive forward would just say to he that spread nonsense and rumour either in this house or on social medium do absolutely nothing to support the worker on that site have listen closely to the minister answer and he be rightly highlight the importance of the job and the redundancy but think we need to be bit clear and more open with people about what the new job in the renewable sector that the minister refer to be about these job be not comparable to lot of the one that will be lose in the oil and gas sector lot of they be not full time job lot of they be part time or temporary job during construction phase we be lose huge number of worker across the country and we will continue to do so because of the government policy on oil and gas and the speed at which the sector be be demolish can the minister please outline directly to these worker across the country whether at prax or in the north east how their job will be support into the future be talk about comparable full time job not just the temporary one key objective of this government be to deliver good well pay trade unionise job and we have be drive that forward my right hon friend the secretary of state have be push on trade union recognition partly to ensure that term and condition in the clean energy industry be as good as those in for example the oil and gas industry we will continue to push on that and we have already have some success gently say that the investment go into clean energy that be deliver thousand of job and will deliver ten of thousand of new job across the country come against backdrop of opposition from the conservatives on great british energy in the north east of scotland deliver those job we be also announce today the final investment decision on sizewell job be be create in nuclear after year of dither and delay by the hon member party we be get on with do this and we will do everything we can to ensure those job be comparable on term and condition and pay say to she that if she want these job to be create she should support some of the policy that will deliver they in the first place thank the minister for his answer bear in mind that the refinery be responsible for supply some of british fuel fuel for the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland it be absolutely essential that way forward be find and find quickly part of that solution must be common sense approach to use fossil fuel what discussion have the minister have with his cabinet colleague to provide long term assurance that there be future for this refinery even at this eleventh hour so it can be sell as go concern as it should the government have push over the past four week we have be aware of this issue to try to find route whereby the refinery can continue as go concern that be obviously our no objective the official receiver assess the bid that be make and find that none be viable to deliver that the government be not go to nationalise this refinery we be not in the business of nationalise loss make business so unfortunately that be not route we will take but we have do everything we can and what we now want to do be assess the bid for the future of the site to see what the maximalist approach be that crucially will keep as many job on the site as possible but also will deliver on the industrial opportunity of that site for the wide community we will continue to have those conversation birmingham bin strikes urgent question to ask the secretary of state for housing communities and local government if she will make statement on the government response to the birmingham bin strike member will be aware of the continue disruption cause by industrial action in birmingham want to be clear that birmingham city council be an independent employer and that this dispute be between the council and unite the trade union the government be rightly not party to it but of course we have an interest in it recognise the impact on local resident this government priority remain birmingham resident and we will continue to support the council to keep birmingham street clear while the dispute remain ongoing thousand of ton of waste have be remove and routine collection have be restore the council continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that waste do not build up again the background to the dispute be the historical equal pay issue the council have face which have be the source of one of the large equal pay crisis in modern uk history and that have to be front of mind the council have be in negotiation for many month make fair and reasonable offer to unite and be clear about the need to protect its equal pay position the union reject the council offer the council have work hard to offer option to affected worker include transfer into other role in the council on the same grade and in some case to upskill those worker in scope an enhance voluntary redundancy package be also available for those who wish to leave the service and there have already be significant uptake give the union rejection of the offer as of last week the council be now enter period of consultation to resolve the dispute while protect its equal pay position urge the union to work with the council on sustainable way forward that be fair to worker in the council and to the resident of birmingham finally hon member may be aware that early today max caller announce that he be retire as lead commissioner in birmingham and wish he well for the future tony mcardle obe have today be appoint by the secretary of state as the new lead commissioner and he will take up his position tomorrow tony bring huge wealth of expertise and be confident that he will continue to deliver on the recovery plan to secure improvement for birmingham resident the bin strike in birmingham have now drag on for over four month and birmingham million resident be pay the price the government have repeatedly scapegoate bin worker yet they refuse to address the root cause and real reason why resident have see their public service crumble and their council tax bill rise by at the heart of this crisis lie year of mismanagement and incompetence under labour run council the minister want to blame the equal pay settlement for cut but conveniently forget that the council have have this settlement loom for over decade over year there have be endless council waste an athlete village that house not single athlete sell off at loss of million million spend on an it system that fail and million spend on consultant now the government stand idly by while their own council cut up to from bin worker this government should be defend frontline worker not their own incompetent council the big betrayal be the government deliberate downplaying of their involvement for month ministers claim that this be local issue yet it be now clear that government appoint commissioner must approve any deal just last week the commissioner reject deal that could have end the strike despite the council managing director be inclined to accept it the misery in birmingham have be prolong not by the worker but by the commissioner and therefore the government this government have the power to end the strike and yet they have actively drag their heel in reach deal that raise serious question about the government commitment to worker right the council action amount to fire and rehire with the government role in these negotiation we must ask be they complicit in aid and abet the very practice they be legislate to ban finally will the minister confirm that the government have the power to remove the commissioner who be block deal will he personally commit to oppose the fire and rehire practice that the council be use hear the hon member charac terisation of the issue but it bear no relationship at all to the reality of the situation the council be an independent employer it be not for the government to go council by council negotiating trade union dispute or term and condition change it be for the council themselves as the employer to negotiate with their workforce and that be exactly the same in birmingham as for other council as he know the commissioner be of course appoint by government and have to act with professional expertise in give advice to the local authority on whether its plan be affordable and lawful but the negotiation be take place between the council itself and unite the trade union and the council workforce on this idea that we be scapegoate the worker in this dispute no party have do more for worker right than labour no government have do more on worker right in generation than this government head by the deputy prime minister when hear member of this house talk in way that degrade that that be complete and absolute failure to accept not just the legacy we inherit as government that include by the way birmingham city council and its local taxpayer but our determination to put that right finally of course birmingham could and should have make some big financial decision much early that be matter of fact and that be why commissioner be in there today but the local government finance settlement have an increase in core spending power of be million of additional money into birmingham that include the large settlement through the recovery grant of any council in the country call the shadow minister as the hon member for birmingham perry barr ayoub khan allude to the house know that the origin of the dispute in birmingham be in the settlement of the equal pay arrangement which create million liability for that local authority under the labour party and which have be undermine at every turn by the relationship between labour administration in birmingham and the union it be clear that that local authority and its leadership have be dodge scrutiny and accountability at every turn they refuse even to debate the local authority conservative group proposal for plan to end the strike and clean up the city have series of question for the minister what guidance will he give his seven strong commissioner team to bring about an end to the strike what public health assessment be the government carry out of the impact of more than tonne of uncollected rubbish and huge increase in the rat population in birmingham will he consider withdraw the facility time for unite the union which be currently refuse to go about the process of bring an end to the strike will he tell his commissioner include tony mcardle whose appointment have be announce today that birmingham besiege household must not be hold to ransom by the union for day long will he tell the house who he think have fail the household of birmingham more be it the labour council in leave rat on the street and tonne of uncollected rubbish in heatwave or this government who have fail to intervene to bring an end to this blight on resident life thank the hon gentleman for his question which will try to answer in turn let say though that we will take no lecture at all from the party that be in government for year and see the downgrading of local authority across the country include in birmingham although these be our commissioner as the hon gentleman say that be correct they be government appoint let we not forget which government appoint they they be appoint on the watch of the previous government today we be just announce change in the lead commissioner we need to be careful not to politicise those people who believe in public service and be help out the local authority and support the government in try to turn that council around let we leave the politicisation of the commissioner to one side and deal with the fact last time be in the chamber the conservatives be talk down the role of bin worker as if somehow that work be degrade at that time think they be suggest that the armed force might be bring in to collect waste and that that would somehow degrade their role that be never go to be the case but it be glimpse into how the conservatives view the worker who be affect one thing that be absolutely certain be that the labour party believe in the power of frontline worker and in the importance of these frontline role we absolutely value the role of refuse collector and we see the implication of waste not be collect but we have get to be clear too that whatever settlement be on the table have to be lawful and affordable and it can not cross the red line of undermine the equal pay negotiation that be take place hope that we can agree at least on that basis call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee thank the minister for outline the government work to maintain vital collection service for resident who want to see their city clean up rather than another summer of this give the recent heatwave strike action have now pass the six month mark as the minister just outline it be important that we consider the hardship feel by many of the strike worker many of they do not want to politicise this they just want to do the right thing by their family one recently tell the bbc morale quite low everyone try to stay strong and together but it be very difficult the union have try to help we out with strike pay but for lot of people it do cover their bill it put massive strain on our family kid money money tight credit card be maxe out nobody should be put in that position hear the minister call for the commissioner birmingham and the union to resolve this issue but what more can he and the government do to bring everyone around the table so that we can finally bring an end to the dispute thank the chair of the select committee for her comment we agree on much she speak to why resolution on this issue be so important at the heart of this there be work people with rent and mortgage to pay who want resolution to be clear the council have be in negotiation over many month and have make fair and reasonable offer to unite which unfortunately the union reject the council have also work hard to offer option to affected worker include their transfer to other role in the council at the same grade and in some case have agree to upskill in scope worker generous redundancy package be available for those who wish to leave the service we have see an uptake in that in the end none of we want this to roll on indefinitely we want to see resolution for the affected worker and for the taxpayer of birmingham who quite rightly expect their local public service to be deliver to good standard call the liberal democrat spokesperson birmingham want its refuse and recycle service back as quickly as possible to end the risk to public health and the environment especially in the most densely populate part of the city the liberal democrats pay tribute to the volunteer and emergency service who be out there clean up the city by deal with refuse waste pile up and fly tipping while the council and union could not agree and continue clash hammer and tong for year under the previous conservative government council be expect to do more and more with less and less and that have bear fruit in birmingham and many other place the government must now grasp the nettle and tackle that funding crisis particularly in social care and local government generally so that what be happen in birmingham do not spread across the country give that one off clean up have cost the council million already be it not time for the government to fund complete clean up of the remain refuse so that resident do not have to foot the bill and spend the rest of the summer live alongside disgusting rubbish will any clean up ensure that waste be properly deal with and recycle where possible give that the city be already rank third from bottom in waste recycling the hon gentleman make fair observation about the funding crisis in local government but it would be remiss of not to take he back to the coalition year which start austerity in local government the liberal democrats be not just casual observer of the demise of local government but active participant in it in those very first year when the cut really bit for local authority they aid and abet our job after year of the impact of those decision be to find way through and we be get on with that we be rebuild the foundation of local government we have announce consultation on the fair funding review which will see redistribution of funding across the country towards the area of high deprivation that need it most we be take into account all the different service pressure we be grasp the nettle on the structural change need in devolution and reorganisation to ensure that the sector be fit legal and decent at the end of the process and we be repair the broken audit market alongside that we be get on with repair the foundation of local government but we need to be clear that this be localise dispute and of course we do not want to see it impact on local people say to the house because have hear this number of time and should have call out the first example that there be not ten of thousand of tonne of waste accumulate on the street of birmingham that be the case and it be deal with efficiently in most case collection be take place for most household at most time and there be not the accumulation of the type we see early clearly the situation be fragile and we do not want it to return to how it be which be why we remain in regular contact with the council welcome the appointment of the new lead commissioner as the minister know we have have many discussion about the intervention include at time from place of concern look forward to work constructively with tony mcardle on behalf of the citizen of birmingham draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests in respect of the gmb and unison union which be the claimant union in the equal pay case in birmingham feel compel to round out the partial account that we have hear today in the chamber will the minister confirm that by far the large share of birmingham equal pay liability of more than billion be incur when the conservatives and liberal democrats run the city and that over the past decade to birmingham suffer the sharp reduction in spend power of any unitary authority in the country with devastating consequence for every constituency in birmingham that be fair point forget that the hon member for birmingham perry barr ayoub khan have brief stint as liberal democrat councillor actually the people of birmingham want we to put the party politic to one side think what matter to local people be first that they be treat fairly when it come to local council tax level and secondly that they get good level of public service for the tax that they pay as my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield laurence turner rightly say there have to be accountability it be matter of fact that some of these big decision should have be take much early and that go back to the conservative and liberal democrat run council his fundamental point about the importance of equal pay and the liability which be big number because of the size of the council and the historic issue there can not be undermine the bad outcome of this dispute would be that decision be make for the short term that do not address the medium and long term completely unravel the equal pay negotiation and by do that undermine the woman worker in scope commend my parliamentary neighbour the hon member for birmingham perry barr ayoub khan for bring this urgent question to the house before it rise also pay tribute to max caller whose retirement have be announce in the last few hour he have dispatch his herculean task with considerable distinction the minister will be aware that labour be now impose the contract which the conservative opposition leader councillor bobby alden urge the labour leadership to do year ago do he understand that my constituent in the royal town of sutton coldfield who come under birmingham for local government purpose have have their patience try beyond endurance by this bankrupt labour council be he aware that recent polling suggest that only of birmingham resident be likely to vote labour next may my constituent and have no doubt those of the hon member for birmingham perry barr be count the day until next may come and we can get rid of this dreadful council thank the right hon member for take my advice and not make this party political bit more refining and we will get there in the end surely the right hon member would expect that the local authority would enter trade union negotiation in good faith and would go as far as it can lawfully go in make settlement offer that respect the worker who be lose pay as result of equal pay because that be surely the right thing to do hope he would not expect the council to disregard that entirely the council rightly care about its workforce not least because many of they will be birmingham city resident themselves and it want to make sure that it support that process the council like we be not happy that the offer be reject by the union but that be not to say that we can not use this time for the conversation to continue so that we can reach resolution that put the people of birmingham first could the minister explain this understand the issue of equal pay and think equal pay be essential important and legally necessary but what we have here be reduction in pay for significant group of worker how can they possibly be hold responsible for the financial problem that birmingham city council have be their case not entirely justify that they be protect their own wage and condition as any good trade union would do in any negotiation can not he simply accept and understand that and that be the basis on which settlement be agree so that they can return to work the way the right hon member start be where would hope most local authority do when look at equal pay but the reality be that there will always be winner and loser in equal pay where woman have be underpaid for long time council have option here they can either compensate and pay upwards for all the female worker in post to the comparable male worker which for most council in most circumstance will not be affordable because there be huge sum attach to that or to make package affordable they have to equalise it out in consultation with the trade union that be exactly what have happen in birmingham the issue in birmingham be very particular to the waste service where previous agreement be reach that honestly do not hold when assess against equal pay in term of the task that be carry out by those worker in the end it do not pass the equal pay test but that be not to say that we be not urge the council and unite the trade union to continue negotiation to resolve this we absolutely want the right outcome for the worker and the resident of birmingham too thank my hon friend the member for birmingham perry barr ayoub khan for table this urgent question also thank the minister for his answer and sympathise with his position but replace this workforce police the dispute and pay the legal fee have cost the already overstretch council million all the while the good people of birmingham the very people who vote in labour council and many labour members of parliament be live in foul misery do the minister agree that it would save million of pound improve our relationship with the dedicated bin worker and restore basic necessity to the people of birmingham if he intervene to get we out of this stink our starting point of course be that we want all party to negotiate in good faith and we want the local authority to do its good to table deal that go as far as it can go but the red line have to be that it can not compromise and completely unravel the equal pay negotiation that have take place to which all the trade union not just unite have be party therein lie the issue the hon member could rightly say think this be what he you just pay what it take to resolve the issue with the strike bin worker but for the equal pay package to hold comparable payment would need to be make to all the female worker in scope so the number he talk about be fantasyland they be not single digit million they be ten or hundred of million of pound which go above both legality and affordability for the local authority we have urge the council to negotiate in good faith with the trade union and to go as far as it can go provide that it be lawful affordable and do not undermine the equal pay liability so far congratulate my hon friend the member for birmingham perry barr ayoub khan on table this urgent question and thank the minister for his response the birmingham bin strike be not just about waste they be about what happen when the state retreat from local service without proper reform the uk must confront the legacy of austerity rethink how local government be fund and run and treat frontline worker with the respect and fairness they deserve failure to do so risk further breakdown in public service and public trust not just in birmingham but all over our country will the minister explain what step the government be take to analyse how we get into this mess in the first place and to ensure that no other council face the same situation anywhere in our country we have to accept that there be some issue here that be unique to birmingham for instance many council across england deal with equal pay over decade ago and birmingham do not which be why the liability have escalate in the way they have on the hon member fundamental point about fair funding and ensure that local public service can be rebuild we can agree we believe that most people local neighbourhood service have be impact so heavily by not only austerity but the growth in demand in adult child and temporary accommodation that we have to completely rethink both how we fund local government and how we reinvest back into prevention and early intervention to prevent that crisis management model thank the minister for his answer and wish he well in his endeavour to enable solution to be find the government have state that they be commit to sustainable resolution to the severe backlog of uncollected waste and the ongoing pay dispute the worker state that they face cut of some per year which would be devastating loss for those with family and responsibility will the minister acknowledge that reduce current wage be not the way forward and that the government must intervene now to make worker feel worthwhile and to sustain trust between the council and the worker whoever be negotiate in this environment will have the same guardrail as the local authority do the local authority have to be mindful of the equal pay package that it have agree with all the trade union and it can not do anything in this very narrow dispute however impactful it be on the worker and local resident that mean completely unravel the equal pay package share the hon member concern about the impact but it be important that the local authority and unite the trade union continue those talk and try to find resolution with that be the final question madam deputy speaker may wish you and other members of the house peaceful recess thank you orgreave inquiry with permission madam deputy speaker will make statement regard this government commitment to establish the truth about event at orgreave in the clash at orgreave coke plant in be etch indelibly into our nation memory the clash mark pivotal moment in the nationwide miner strike that be ongoing during that period some picketer be arrest and charge with riot and violent disorder but all charge be later drop after evidence be discredit as result of the violence there be serious implication for the relationship between policing and coalfield community at that time and the passage of time have not diminish the impact on those present and their family on thursday last week the home secretary visit the site of the former orgreave coking plant along with campaigner from the national union of mineworkers and the orgreave truth and justice campaign as well as number of member of this house and the mayor of south yorkshire know that the home secretary be very grateful to all those who take the time to attend and that she be move by the experience they share and by walk part of the route that picketer walk on that day year ago it be this labour government commitment to get truth and justice for those coalfield community it be important to note that there have be significant change in the oversight of police since and the way in which public order be police nevertheless question about the specific event at orgreave have remain unanswered for far too long more than four decade may have pass but those question must still be answer that be why we commit in labour manifesto to ensure through an investigation or inquiry that the truth about event at orgreave come to light yesterday we make good on that promise as the home secretary announce the establishment of an inquiry into event surround the clash at the orgreave coking plant in the rt rev dr pete wilcox the bishop of sheffield have agree to chair the inquiry the bishop be very well respect member of the local and wide regional community in south yorkshire and his credibility and impartiality will stand he in very good stead to deliver this inquiry he will be support by small panel of independent expert who will be appoint in due course in similar vein to the hillsborough panel chair by the bishop of liverpool in the purpose of the inquiry will be to aid public understanding of how the violent clash and injury cause at orgreave on june and the event immediately afterwards come to pass it will be statutory inquiry under the inquiries act with the appropriate power to compel the provision of information where necessary the direction of the inquiry investigation will be matter for the chair as the sponsor department the home office will provide support and ensure that the inquiry have the resource need to fulfil its term of reference but it will have no other say in the conduct of the inquiry or the conclusion that it may reach until it be time for we to respond to they it will be key for the inquiry to have access to all information that it deem relevant for that reason the home secretary have recently write to all police force the national police chiefs council the college of policing and all government departments to ask that all material they hold relate to the event at orgreave be retain in order that it can be provide in timely manner to the inquiry if request recognise the need to deliver swiftly while avoid any undue impact on individual wellbee hope the inquiry will look to previous example of good practice such as the hillsborough independent panel to inform its method of delivery the home secretary be in the process of consult the inquiry chair on propose term of reference she have ask he to engage with key stakeholder include the national union of mineworkers and the orgreave truth and justice campaign as part of that process we will place final copy of the term of reference in the libraries of both houses at the early opportunity thereafter it be our expectation that the inquiry will launch in the autumn for the police to perform their critical function effectively it be essential that they can secure and maintain the confidence of the people they serve that be why this labour government have make rebuild trust in police an integral part of our plan for change of course much of that effort be concern with strengthen force for the challenge of now and the future but where historical event cast long shadow that stretch into the present day in our coalfield community we must shine light on what happen and ensure that any and all lesson be learn question about event at orgreave have go unanswered for too long this government commit to put that right and the upcoming inquiry will work independently fairly and without fear or favour to establish the truth about what happen commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of her statement grow up in the north east know the emotion stir by the miner strike decade after the event they continue to cause significant division and disagreement in our community regardless of people view on the right and wrong of the incident historic event such as this which see conflict and violence on our street will always be deeply regrettable we must acknowledge that in the decade since no government include the last labour government which have year deem it necessary to establish such an inquiry that labour government include three current home office ministers with the current minister for border security and asylum the hon member for wallasey dame angela eagle serve in the home office at the time if this inquiry have real contribution to make why do the then labour government not hold one what have change as member will know there have be previous call for such an inquiry but when the decision be make not to grant one it be base on reason ground there have be passage of time and there have be significant legislative and systematic change in the decade since as the home secretary say in her write statement there have be significant change in the oversight of police since and to the way that public order be now police do the minister believe that an inquiry be likely to result in any meaningful and relevant lesson for today police system the minister be long stand advocate for those impact by infected blood case of truly disgraceful systematic treatment over decade similarly the hillsborough panel highlight the deep injustice of tragedy involve this police force but both those inquiry understandably come at considerable cost will the minister outline what the department anticipate that deliver proportionate and meaningful inquiry on this issue will cost the press report on the propose chairman raise serious question about his ability to act in politically neutral and independent manner can the minister assure the house that the inquiry will not be political in nature and that it will listen to the view of all party present on the day so that it be not merely an example of the government put the interest of the union ahead of the police as with so many issue recently this raise question about the commitment of the government to support brave police officer who act within the law to do their job can she confirm that the government be commit to support police officer who put themselves in harm way to keep public order and comply with their training and instruction finally note from the government publication that the inquiry will be statutory with power to compel individual to provide information where necessary that sound remarkably similar to request that we have make to the government which be repeatedly reject the victim and survivor of rape gang deserve detailed update on the progress of that inquiry yet the lack of information about how the new inquiry will be set up and how it will compel evidence lead to conclude that the government have prioritise the miner over the minor who suffer horrific exploitation at the hand of rape gang this labour government union paymaster should not determine the pecking order of justice in this country there be still perpetrator of child sexual exploitation and those who cover it up who have go unpunished yet the government have choose to prioritise this inquiry in her audit baroness casey speak of the need to implement inquiry that be time limited ask the government to focus on this issue and give their initial refusal to do so ensure that action be take at much great speed to bring about justice for those young vulnerable woman who suffer at the hand of rape gang be go to start by say that welcome the shadow minister initial comment in which he recognise how the situation at orgreave all those year ago still cast shadow over community in yorkshire the north east and other part of the country must say that be surprise by some of his comment because know that he be good man and be try his good to fulfil the role of shadow policing minister will answer his question and will come on to the issue of groom gang that he raise in the latter part of his contribution but must say that find his comment extremely distasteful as well as not accurate or correct first will deal with the question of why we be have this orgreave inquiry our manifesto commit we to ensure that there be thorough investigation or inquiry so that the truth about the event at orgreave come to light we be deliver on that manifesto commitment today as say in my statement we be also commit to rebuild public confidence in policing and campaigner and mining community have spend decade search for answer about what happen the purpose of the inquiry will be to aid the public understanding of how the event at orgreave on june and immediately afterwards come to pass hope that explain why we be take this action today the shadow minister ask about the cost we have be very clear that the home office will meet the cost of the inquiry we be also mindful that we want the inquiry to be as expeditious as possible and to be value for money that be why we have look at the model of the hillsborough independent inquiry we think that be good model to follow certainly there will be conversation with the chair about the project cost and the timeline that he will want to set out turn to the issue of the chair again be really disappoint by the shadow minister remark about the bishop bishop pete have previously support call for an inquiry it be important to note that that be in the context of his pastoral role in which he have support member of the diocese of sheffield who be impact by the event at orgreave he certainly do not show any favour towards either the police or the picketer when call for that inquiry do not think that that call detract from the necessary credibility impartiality and independence that believe bishop pete will bring to his role as chair of the inquiry he have the backing and support of the key stakeholder in take that role forward it be also important to remember that the chair of the inquiry will be support by small group of independent member who will have expert knowledge in certain area to help the chair fulfil his term of reference as the shadow minister say the inquiry be statutory that be because we recognise the importance of ensure that document can be bring forward it be important that people can be compel to produce document and that witness can be compel as well finally the shadow minister refer to the issue of groom gang he will know that great deal of work have be do to make sure that the hideous appal situation that have be uncover around the groom gang will now be deal with the safeguarding minister my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips have give statement to the house as have the home secretary and there have be clear list of the action that be be take it be absolutely right that that work be do of course when the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse be set up under the previous government there be support across the house for the work of professor alexis jay it be great pity that the previous government do not enact any of professor jay recommendation that be the hugely shameful state of affair that this government inherit but be absolutely clear that this government be deal with grooming gang that be the right thing to do but equally set up the orgreave inquiry today be the right thing to do very much welcome the policing minister announce to the house the action that the government will be take be active at the time of the miner strike and now represent former mining village many of the man represent be at orgreave and if we be to take even small sample of opinion as to what those man think happen there they would say that the finger point in one direction only at no and at people closely associate with mrs thatcher want to ask about the inquiry term of reference on the day odd man be arrest on trump up charge with evidence falsify by police officer have meet some of those police officer and they say that they have order from above tell they what to say and what to write that be serious matter man be put on bail put in prison or even hospitalise all on trump up charge will the inquiry term of reference allow the bishop who be good man to pursue the trail of evidence wherever it lead in order to determine once and for all how that injustice be organise by people in the conservative party be grateful to my hon friend for his question know that he have great deal of experience and knowledge in this area as say in my statement the term of reference be currently be discuss with the chair but it be very clear that the inquiry should look at the evidence and should hear testimony if that be what it wish to do it will do so without fear or favour wherever the evidence lead it to look call the liberal democrat spokesperson come into the chamber for this statement to hear and speak about the orgreave inquiry so it be pretty shocking to hear the shadow minister use it as an opportunity to yet again play politic with child sexual abuse and exploitation as survivor myself find that particularly appalling the liberal democrats welcome the announcement of statutory inquiry into the event that take place between police and miner at orgreave on june for year those catch up in the harrowing event of that day have have to carry the painful trauma of that unresolved injustice not just the injury sustain but the police charge that be subsequently drop over year on we must come together to ensure that this inquiry reach its full potential and uncover the answer that those impact deeply deserve that must include proper consultation which will be key to rebuild public trust would therefore welcome more detail from the minister about how local community campaigner and impact miner and their family will be involve throughout the inquiry inquiry can be powerful tool for uncover the truth about injustice but they will only reach their full potential when there be duty of candour that require public official and authority to co operate fully as such although the government have commit to bring such duty of candour into force will the minister take this opportunity to provide clear timeline for introduce hillsborough law to parliament be grateful to the hon gentleman for what he have say to put thing in context the home secretary and have meet range of key stakeholder already to hear their respective view on the scope and nature of the orgreave inquiry and what it should seek to achieve there have already be consultation with the orgreave truth and justice campaign the national union of mineworkers south yorkshire police the mayor of south yorkshire and many member of this house who have an interest in this issue include my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion as orgreave lie in her constituency we have also meet other interested party in the field of law one of they whom meet personally be michael mansfield kc he be the lawyer who represent number of those who be charge at orgreave we have also meet academic because we know that there be value in look at what academic can show we about what work with inquiry we have therefore already engage in lot of consultation there be far ongoing consultation on the term of reference and that be the responsibility of the chair expect that all the party we have meet will be engage again there be active work be do on the hillsborough law at the moment can not give timeline today but know that it will be bring to the house shortly it be privilege to be in the chamber today to hear that we be finally get the inquiry that have long be campaign for by the orgreave truth and justice campaign the num and many in my community and across south yorkshire they be simply ask for the truth the shadow minister have just say that the inquiry should not be politicise but do the minister agree that orgreave be political it be one of the most political thing that have ever happen to south yorkshire and it be incredibly important that the inquiry be put on statutory footing so that it can compel people to give evidence and get to the truth of something that many in our community still bear the scar of my hon friend speak with great knowledge about how orgreave have affect her community so many year on she make the important point that there be political context to this inquiry those of we who be around then know that it be very political time with the miner strike and all that it be absolutely right that we have this opportunity to look across the piece at what happen at orgreave as my hon friend the member for normanton and hemsworth jon trickett say there be perhaps the involvement of other politician so it be important that we recognise the political context that be why again it be so important that the inquiry will be put on statutory footing to allow document to be demand and witness to be compel to give evidence first welcome the statement that have be make by the minister today it be an enormous step forward and we should pay huge tribute to the orgreave truth and justice campaign and in particular kate flannery and chris peace and their colleague for all the great work that they have do for long time labour pledge to hold an inquiry in its last three manifesto in and so this be good step forward will the minister bear in mind carefully what the hon member for normanton and hemsworth jon trickett say in his excellent question life be ruin people be badly injure as result of orgreave they suffer for many year and be unable to work because they be blacklist and for other reason charge be make on trump up evidence and consequently people suffer it have go on for long time we need to know number of thing will the term of reference allow evidence to be take under oath from wherever it need to be take and from whoever be there arthur scargill and many other and all those survive miner who be there must be give time to explain exactly what happen we also need to know the role of south yorkshire police in the attack that take place against those miner so that we can get to the truth realise that put timetable on an inquiry be slightly difficult thing to do because we do not want to prevent the inquiry from get all the evidence it need but we also do not want the inquiry to run on forever and lose its impetus and purpose can the minister therefore give we some idea of roughly how long she expect the inquiry to take to report be she prepared to accept interim report so that rapid progress can be make will the minister assure the house that where the evidence lead to the culpability of ministers police officer senior civil servant or many other throughout the command chain for the event that the hon member for normanton and hemsworth explain prosecution will follow with evidence put before the court and if necessary people bring to justice for it we have to bring justice to the totality of this event agree with the right hon gentleman about pay tribute to the orgreave truth and justice campaign have the privilege to meet some of the member of that campaign and fully acknowledge and appreciate how life be ruin and family have suffer lot not just the people there on the day but the wide family have suffer it be absolutely right that we set up this inquiry life have be ruin know that the chair will take note of the right hon gentleman comment about what he would like to see in the term of reference as to the timetable absolutely agree want this inquiry to be conduct as quickly as possible but as thoroughly as possible we be look at timeframe of around two year but that be in the early discussion that we have obviously can not prejudge the recommendation of the inquiry we will need to look at those recommendation when they be make as chair of the coalfield group of labour mps and on behalf of the group welcome this statement it be an historic moment and know that orgreave truth and justice campaigner and many more labour colleague would have be present have they have little more notice the minister will know that even last year organisation such as northumbria police be destroy document those action could hinder this inquiry and it be vital that individual and organisation be hold accountable not just for what happen year ago but for any attempt to undermine justice by destroy evidence will the minister confirm that the inquiry will have access to all information and evidence and that no further document will be destroy or evidence withhold will the inquiry have the power to compel witness testimony hope that this inquiry will not only uncover the truth but make recommendation to right the wrong do to many miner include some of my constituent who be wrongly convict under riot and unlawful assembly law ray patterson now sadly no long with we be one of those miner thank the minister and the government for honour the manifesto pledge first will deal with this issue around document the home secretary recently write to all police force in england and wales and all government departments to remind they of the relevant legislative framework for record management and to ask that information relate to the event at orgreave on june be retain the home secretary have ask if any document have be destroy what those document be and why they be destroy it be also worth remind the house that under section of the inquiries act it be criminal offence to destroy or conceal information relevant to public inquiry thank the minister very much for her statement and for her carefully choose word on contentious issue ask she this question gently from experience do she appreciate that similar to the prosecution of veteran and service personnel in northern ireland ask retire officer why he make split second decision year ago what be happen in detail when he make that decision and the exact wording of direction give to he be and can be incredibly distressing and upsetting those officer be now in their or perhaps even their what support can the minister offer they to enable they to cope with the re traumatisation that they will undoubtedly suffer that be an important point this be not the first time minister have have to stand here and agree to an inquiry into event that happen long time ago the hon gentleman and have work together on the infected blood inquiry so he will know that it take long time to arrive at that point fully recognise that the length of time involve mean some people sadly will have die while other will be very elderly and have to recall what happen this be not how we would want it to be be it as for the hon gentleman point about those who will be call to give testimony to the inquiry know that the bishop will be consider what support should be provide to help the witness whether they be police officer or picketer and their family and be sure that that will be uppermost in his mind as one who represent constituency in the heart of the durham coalfield recognise the press need for an inquiry into the event that occur at the orgreave plant on june and like other send huge thank you to the member of the orgreave truth and justice campaign who have work for decade for this moment do the minister share my frustration at the length of time it have take the house to invoke such crucial inquiry and will she commit herself to investigate the role and involvement of central government in the planning and instruction on how to allocate resource financial and otherwise in the lead up to during and after that day at the height of the miner strike in rotherham bitterly regret the fact that it have take so long for the inquiry to be establish as have say there be number of other cause but we should have be look at this far early think it helpful that member be express their view about what should be cover by the term of reference for the inquiry because know that the bishop will want to note what the house and its member have to say and ensure that they form part of his discussion about those term of reference it be allege that amber rudd refuse to hold an orgreave inquiry because it would slur the memory of thatcher can the minister confirm that this inquiry will have statutory power to compel witness to provide evidence and that politic will not get in the way of uncover the truth once and for all can absolutely confirm that this be statutory inquiry with all the legal power that statutory inquiry have to compel the provision of document and of evidence from witness and to go wherever the evidence lead it as the chair of the all party parliamentary group for miscarriage of justice and lifelong trade unionist welcome the long overdue announcement of statutory inquiry into orgreave and pay tribute to all who have campaign for truth and justice particularly the orgreave truth and justice campaign however give the serious concern about evidence that have be destroy tamper with or withhold will the minister confirm that any inquiry will be underpin by clear legal duty of candour to guarantee full transparency and accountability on the part of all those involve include the police and former government official so that the victim and campaigner receive the full answer that they deserve we give careful consideration to the role play by the hillsborough independent inquiry because we think it would be very useful for the chair of this inquiry to look at the model that it provide take my hon friend point about the duty of candour and work be be do on put that into statute but the bishop will be look at all these issue remember clearly the miner strike of and in particular what happen at orgreave and know that it have many painful memory for lot of people so let first thank and commend the government for hold this statutory public inquiry it appear that after four decade we will finally secure some truth and justice in relation to what happen on june and also what happen to the miner and how they be treat will the minister please assure the house that if the inquiry do reveal evidence of misconduct and wrongdoing the necessary action will be take and that we will learn lesson to ensure that nothing like this ever happen again be grateful to my hon friend for his comment it be clear that once the inquiry have be establish we must let it do its work and make its recommendation and we will then seek to respond to those recommendation thank the minister for her statement and for launch the inquiry thus keep our manifesto promise in coalfield community such as mine many former miner still bear the scar physical and mental of what happen at orgreave year ago and our town and village still feel that collective sense of injustice great many man want to share their story of that day to ensure their own closure but also to ensure that the truth will out will the minister assure my constituent and ex miner up and down the country that they will have an opportunity to contribute to the inquiry be sure that the bishop will listen carefully to the comment that member have make know that some people would feel very comfortable talk about what happen explain and give testimony while other would not want to do that it will be for the bishop to decide on the good way forward to ensure that the inquiry hear from individual and have access to the document and he will be set out the term of reference shortly strongly welcome the minister statement and the fulfilment of that manifesto commitment and like other pay tribute to the orgreave truth and justice campaign be sure that member across the house will have be disturb by report of the destruction of potentially relevant document point that have already be ably raise the home office be currently consider the case for institute public inquiry into the birmingham pub bombing and do not expect the minister to pre empt that today but in respect of the preservation of record will the department consider take the same action to preserve potentially relevant document include those hold by external body in advance of that decision the northumbria police case highlight the particular risk of accidental loss or deliberate destruction in advance of that legal protection kick in would welcome the chance to discuss this matter far with the minister be very happy to discuss this matter with my hon friend think it worth point out that police force be independent of government and that decision concern the management of their record be for they to make in accordance with their respective review and policy on retention and disposal the government expect any such decision to be make in accordance with relevant legislation and national guidance and as have say it be criminal offence to destroy document that may be relevant or to conceal information that would interest public inquiry music streaming label lead principles and now for something completely different with permission madam deputy speaker will make statement about the government progress with industry on the remuneration of artist in

be deeply grateful to the bpi the major label and the association of independent music for engage with this work want to recognise the dedication of the council of music makers which include the featured artists coalition the ivors academy the music managers forum the music producers guild and the musicians union for its tireless commitment to its member finally my thank go to the culture

that make up the soundtrack to the most meaningful moment in our life moment of joy and sorrow they be song that live forever our music industry be true global success story it have global star like adele ed sheeran and my favourite band oasis and world class cultural institution such as the royal academy of music and the london symphony orchestra our music industry remain one of our great and strong export to the world it not only showcase our talent on the world stage but contribute billion to our economy it be truly jewel in the crown of our thriving creative sector as the minister have note streaming have transform the music industry benefit both listener and artist audience now have access to more music than ever before and artist can reach listener on scale they could only dream of in the past however as the minister identifie there be concern about whether artist receive fair deal in this delicate ecosystem and the opposition share that concern although contract between artist label and streaming platform be private commercial agreement know that member on both side of the house agree that the success of streaming should not come at the expense of artist livelihood in the previous conservative government ask the competition and markets authority to conduct study into the music and streaming service be encourage to learn that the cma find no evidence of publishing revenue be suppress by distorted or restricted competition and that the share of streaming revenue go to publisher and songwriter have increase from in to in recent year however concern remain especially around the use of artificial intelligence across the creative industry know that the government have commission independent research on the impact on creator performer and the wide industry of potential change to copyright law in the area of equitable remuneration contract adjustment and right reversion furthermore the centre for data ethics and innovation have complete research on the playlisting algorithm use by streaming service can assure the minister that members on both side of the house want well deal for artist songwriter and performer that be why we broadly welcome the government take an industry lead approach to this issue if only they do that elsewhere must however press the minister to provide assurance to the house first what consequence will there be for label that fail to comply with the new principle and what percentage of artist do he believe will benefit from today announcement secondly what message do he have for creative and publisher who remain deeply concerned that they be not be fairly reward for their hard work lastly will the government commit to review these reform within month to ensure that they be work for the industry incidentally see that the former shadow secretary of state be here the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew now shadow secretary of state for health and social care we wish he well in his new job it be great delight to hear from the hon member for old bexley and sidcup mr french but he be always so grumpy when he actually want to say well do do not know about you madam deputy speaker but sometimes think of the conservatives as the all fur coat and nothing else party because they make nice statement but never actually do anything it be fascinating to hear he say we have concern about the remuneration of musician why do they do absolutely nothing on this subject when they be in government it have take labour government to sit down with industry and creator to make sure that we deliver change for people the hon gentleman ask what happen if people fail to comply be absolutely confident that all the label that we be talk about will want to adopt the principle because they have be part of the negotiating process we have to have tough conversation at various point but they have sign up to the principle and will deliver on they be confident that if any legacy artist say to their label want to renegotiate my contract they will have chance to renegotiate although the precise term of that renegotiation will of course be matter for the artist and the label some people who sign contract before streaming come into existence might have be on rate of something like or they will be able to negotiate that up to digital right more like or that will make significant difference to legacy artist many people have make the very strong point that it be all very well increase the number of stream of legacy artist work but if they do not get any more money as result that will not really benefit either the record label or the legacy artist be very confident that this package will deliver the hon gentleman ask about have review in month time can do well than that as have say we will review this in month time because if the package have not deliver we reserve the right to bring in legislation make this point several time in the eu there be an equitable renumeration clause in legislation and if we feel the need for that we could progress that however after our really good discussion with all the party be very confident that all of they want to comply with this package will make one other point about songwriter lot of people know the famous name we all talk about the hon gentleman refer to ed sheeran oasis and so on but lot of those who really deliver be the songwriter they create the thing that rattle around our brain for year and year make sure that they be not out of pocket be one of the really important principle want to adopt be really proud that for the first time there will be per day plus expense to make sure that no songwriter be out of pocket that be match with the deal that the ivors academy be do with sony for year we have to invest in the songwriter of the future so that we have the strong music industry we want for the future but be not impressed by his fur coatery on famous name call paul waugh thank you madam deputy speaker first declare an interest in that my son fin be member of the band big huge new circle whose late single pearl be out on spotify and be recommend by clash magazine which call it beautifully complex welcome today announcement particularly the introduction of per diem and the session musician uplift thank the former member for cardiff west who be sit in the peers gallery for all his work on this it be hugely welcome and perfectly time for the musicians union delegate conference this week give the widespread concern about fair pay for streaming and how long it have be since our select committee first report on this can the minister explain what further power the government hold to intervene if these industry lead measure fall short first of all can wish be it big huge new circle interruption yes big huge new circle so we have get it in hansard three time now will take my fee obviously or it be for lot of agent these day obviously the future of the music industry in the uk depend on have pipeline the single most important thing we can do be make sure that every single child have an opportunity to be musician at school creative education in our school not only deliver by provide musician but be force multipli for lot of other form of education that be something on which be work very closely with the department for education note that lord brennan be up in the gallery that be another song from music hall think my hon friend be absolutely right that lord brennan who be on the select committee be one of the drive force make sure that there be not only first report but second report in the last parliament he hold the government foot to the fire be determined to do precisely the same when it come to the record label honestly believe that we will now have one of the good arrangement in the world for the remuneration of artist from streaming and be sure that the record label will stick with the arrangement call the liberal democrat spokesperson britain musician have long be our most beloved cultural treasure in the crowded field of excellence in our creative sector our musician be some of our proud export they be part of billion industry that drive our economy so support for our legacy and session musician be completely overdue and very welcome the musician cover include the devines in berkhamsted upcoming artist like myles smith and national treasure like elton john agree that adele be one of our national treasure and as be mention all those around they songwriter producer and those who support they technological change mean that online streaming now constitute the vast bulk of music consumption and new track day be upload to music platform this often leave hole in musician income so it be absolutely right that the government be take this issue seriously we simply need to get this right so ask the minister to clarify for the house how much confidence we can really have that the principle he be spell out will finally lead to more equitable distribution of stream revenue ultimately this be label lead voluntary framework where be the independent oversight crucially what guarantee be there of consistency or enforcement across the industry we have raise this issue many time in the past but it remain true that if we be serious about protect artist right to remuneration we need to ensure that copyright which have underpin success for decade work in our digitally evolve world musician and creative face an ai tsunami which could pose threat to their livelihood we need to tackle it seriously conclude by ask the minister once more to consider swifter action from the government on copyright and data mining in order to support our musician and creative as well as innovation across the uk think the hon member be in danger of become national treasure herself interruption oh see that have not unite the house on that the right hon member for daventry can not keep heckle he be the shadow health secretary now the important point be that the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins ask what confidence we can have that this will be adhere to and be very confident that it will have have face to face conversation with all the chief executive of the major record label and although sometimes have be ask they to go far they have go that extra mile and be absolutely sure that they will deliver on this be confident that any legacy artist who want to renegotiate their contract will be able to do so we will be look at precisely how that happen if anybody be not happy with their renegotiation we have include in the principle means of appeal that be obviously major role of the musicians union but if by the autumn we suddenly find that lot of musician be say excuse but have manage to renegotiate with my label then we will be return to this issue the record label be fully aware of that but they be determined each be go to put together bespoke package to try to revitalise legacy work they be also look at wipe off unrecoupe balance and make sure people can earn more into the future the one thing have always be nervous about it be that do not think government should be write contract this be really important julie andrews when she take the role of maria in the sound of music decide or this be how the negotiation end up that she would just take an up front free and she never get pay any royalty thereafter that be probably poor decision or she be not give any other choice however think schwarzenegger when he make movie quite often decide to take the royalty and do not take any up front fee different artist will enter renegotiation in different way but we want to rebalance the equation so that it be more in the interest of the musician and that be what we have do welcome this statement it be brilliant three week ago have the most fantastic visit to universal music thank to charlotte allan for sort that out also speak to the chief executive dickon their support love and continued passion for bring in new artist be really transparent and obvious to so to hear this arrangement for legacy artist be just wonderful it be not do in timely enough manner but it be wonderful that just over year after get into power we have effect this change thank the minister for that be also very pleased to see in the statement commitment to have more conversation with session musician on ensure that they get the recognition they should be get will he give some idea of the timeframe for those next step be grateful to my hon friend for what she say about dickon he be really very helpful at universal in the process of get we to this place particularly on the issue of per diem the day which be one of the major ask of the ivors academy and be really pleased we be able to do that she be right that we need to look at session musician and of one of the undertaking have make be that will be get the bpi and the musicians union together to discuss that matter again this autumn hope that will be in the first couple of week of september give the minister helpful reference of sartorial nature to his opposite number may congratulate he on his carefully understate choice of necktie today shall certainly remember to bring my dark glass next time he be on parade can he explain to as an ardent swiftie myself what protection performer such as the son of the hon member for rochdale paul waugh have against their track be upload by anyone to service such as youtube whereby it be possible for people to enjoy their music without apparently pay they any royalty at all be grateful for the comment about my tie would say that it be understate compare to some of the other tie have wear so be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his commendation on my sartorial elegance but he be wrong about youtube youtube be one of the streaming service and people be remunerate one could argue that they should be remunerate more but if people be breach copyright that be an offence and it need to be pursue record label be pretty keen on do so on behalf of their artist but as say youtube be one of the stream outlet welcome the minister statement and his work along with the government we will now be among world leader in support our creative industry especially on streaming remuneration will he outline how he will ensure the change fairly benefit all artist include legacy performer session musician and those outside major label what step will be take to enforce industry wide implementation especially if voluntary measure fall short the argument for do this be partly because all musician simply do not earn enough to make living that be the truth of the matter have million streaming might equate to earn theoretical amount of money but the musician will not earn that amount because it will be dilute by the various process it go through the money the agent take and all the rest of it maybe that be why so many artist have produce song about poverty even destiny child with bills bills bills it have be an obsession for many artist there be sometimes the impression that an artist in music or in any other creative industry can only be really good if they have struggle bit but the truth be that we want people to be able to make living out of their creative industry key part of be labour government be be able to deliver that may invite the minister to congratulate isle of wight band wet leg on reach the top of the album chart particular achievement give that it have beat oasis which know have personally disappoint my hon friend the member for old bexley and sidcup mr french yes be more wet leg than oasis as well as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on music commend the minister on do an excellent job of bring record label into these new provision the history of the music industry be sadly full of tale of exploitation and the industry have prove notable for its intransigence protect the dignity of british songwriter by put money in their pocket be welcome step and it be pleasing to see great transparency over artist renegotiation however it be clear that the label provision as helpful as they be do not change or rectify the economic injustice of the streaming model as it stand as the minister know copyright law be not bring up to do date for streaming never mind for what be approach with ai more than half the membership of the musicians union earn less than year commend the minister for his effort but can he also offer members reassurance that this be not job do when so many music creator and worker be still so poorly serve by current arrangement what more be he go to do for new and emerge artist in term of the streaming model the one bit we have not be able to address be the amount of money that go from the streamer themselves directly to the record label that be an international settlement so it be more difficult for we to address there be time when first arrive in the house when musician be get absolutely nothing and the amount of money go to record label and musician fall off cliff because of pirated music spotify and other streaming service then come into the equation and manage to rectify some of that but the situation be far from ideal wish more of the money be go directly to the artist it be my own personal decision that do not stream music buy music because think more of the money go to the artist that way but of course for million of people in the uk even for the swiftie over there on the opposition benches the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis be sure that streaming be convenient way of access music that they might never have come across otherwise welcome today announcement not least because be the mum of an aspire composer and performer be pleased that the minister mention the work of teacher and the department for education in support music in school credit should go to mr wardrobe from downlands community school in hassocks for put together the band room by literally put they in the practice room room when they be at school they be now do really well and perform regularly in brighton how can the minister ensure that the benefit announce today be not just concentrate in london but benefit all the region include sussex commend mr wardrobe who have make the room where it happen musically commend all music teacher remember when be at school our music teacher decide that the boy choir should sing song from musical unfortunately it include the line do know how to love he and ve love so many man before and he suddenly decide that we would not be sing it anymore so music teacher do not always get it right but sometimes they be courageous it be really important we ensure that this be about not just london but the whole uk that be one reason that it be important that we get the per diem issue sort songwriter from across the uk sometimes do have to travel into london for song camp write camp or whatever and make sure they get their expense plus per diem be really important part of ensure that this do not just apply to some people in our city refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests really welcome the statement which provide more support for grassroots music creator it be also important that grassroots music creator have the grassroots music venue to play in include the fantastic acoustic couch in bracknell will minister update the house on the department plan for support grassroots music venue across the country yes and commend acoustic couch have not visit but be sure an invitation will be on its way very soon we want to preserve as many of our small music venue as we possibly can that be why we be push as hard as possible the idea of levy on arena ticket be delighted that the royal albert hall announce yesterday that it will be first venue across the uk to implement that have push live nation to step up on this and it say yes yes yes but it feel bit like maybe maybe maybe so be still say quando quando quando welcome this industry lead approach that be the right thing to do but we also need to bear in mind the artist who need remuneration at the end of it they be not do it for the money but they do deserve to be pay what plan do ministers have for the independent monitoring of the implementation ask that so the minister do not himself have to retain an eye of the tiger at all time oh dear the hon gentleman be bad than interruption oh yes he be and it not even panto season yet interruption he have very moderate tie though it be important that we have proper evaluation we be in the process of work out precisely how we will do that have say to the group that we will convene in year time by then we will have evaluate fully whether this have really work be honestly very confident that it will deliver the good the hon gentleman say that artist be not necessarily do it for the money go to see alison moyet at kew gardens couple of week ago she be absolutely magnificent at the beginning of she set she say not necessarily go to play what everybody want to play because this be karaoke an artist and musician not just celebrity that balance be really important for lot of artist and musician they need to earn living but they be also artist who have their own condition and they need to be able to pursue what lie in their heart start oh that be bright tie minister start by echo early comment thank the former member for cardiff west the union and the ivors academy for their important campaigning on this issue and congratulate the minister for get this important deal over the line the music industry have long suffer with issue of transparency and have no doubt that the minister will want to ensure that these announcement make real world difference will he therefore tell we little more about the independent scrutiny that will be in place to ensure that these new measure be implement and will he say whether there be means of audit what benefit music maker will see from these change my hon friend be absolutely right we need to ensure that the new measure be implement as say do not want to undermine confidence in that because do not want to give anybody get out clause for not implement they we will be work over the next few week with both the bpi and the association of independent music on put together proper evaluation process over the next year and hope will be make statement in year time although obviously that will not be up to on precisely how it have work out as say early reckon this be worth several ten of million of pound of extra investment in the british music industry and think we will see that it have deliver just return to the issue of my tie madam deputy speaker it be day of the dead tie by van buck the minister do very well to shake off the abuse about his tie from the swiftie on the opposition benches it be mainly empty space there the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis his reputation remain unscathed calder valley have thriving creative sector with lot of small and independent artist who have lose out to streaming today announcement be welcome of course but small artist face the twin threat of both ai and streaming will the minister assure and the house that he will do more to ensure that those small artist can get the money in their pocket where it belong the point make about the remuneration of musician and all form of artist apply equally to streaming and to ai the secretaries of state for culture media and sport and for science innovation and technology hold their first meeting last week with the creative industry and ai company to discuss how we proceed on the issue of ai and copyright there be broadly outlined set of principle one of which be undoubtedly that those who make the original work must be remunerate when it be use to create some other form of work and some other form of value agree with my hon friend on his point about empty space on the opposition benches empty chair at empty table today news be great especially for the artist and musician in my constituency who regularly play at the bootleg fantastic venue that we must ensure stay open for future generation to enjoy as my dad and have enjoy it what plan be in place to engage with artist representative and the trade union to ensure that today welcome change deliver meaningful improvement for artist at all stage of their career it be good to see my hon friend in his place gather that the pier be for sale indicate assent be not sure whether he be intend to buy it himself of course many act have appear on the pier over the year my hon friend make the point again about the importance of have small venue where people can perform to start and build their career and end up as the kind of household success that we know not everybody will earn million from music but we do want many more people to be able to make decent live out of their music in the uk establish good term of trade and have strong copyright regime be absolutely key to deliver that the musicians union be key part of the discussion that we hold throughout the last year for the final question call chris vince thank you madam deputy speaker there be some mention of national treasure early to quote alison moyet only you laughter will be call last next time from the newtown neurotics to do worry and the subways harlow have always have vibrant music scene what plan do the minister have to engage with artist at all stage of their career to ensure that these welcome change provide meaningful improvement well be all cry out that be not on my hon friend list of national treasure he make very important point we need to ensure that these change apply across the whole of the united kingdom in her performance at kew alison moyet also make the point that every child be musician and an artist until they be persuade not to be at some point in their life this be what really want to embrace in everything that the government do in this area in relation to the creative industry we talk about film and the big famous success that we have in the uk but actually lot of it be about real hard graft by people who have have to learn how to perform well what it be to be in front of an audience how it be to market their performance and all the rest of it it be tough tough tough half the time all those musician be say

will be review into the blood and urine test take at the time of those test you will appreciate the significance of that madam deputy speaker because of the risk of radiation poisoning the government have say that the review will be publish but we have no clarity as to when there be ten of thousand of these record which be be examine as we speak have you have any notice from ministers on when they will come to the house with an interim report these man be now elderly they be die of course because of their age by the week and month however along with the hon member for salford rebecca long

order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision to remove crown immunity as it apply to prison for the purpose of health and safety legislation katie allen live in clarkston in east renfrewshire she have love family and very happy childhood she be bright and do well at school she take herself off to malawi to volunteer and she return from africa determine to help people instead of study geology at university as she have intend she switch to study human geography because she decide and realise that it be people whom she care about and not rock she be excited about the future she have move into her own flat she be full of life she be beautiful and she be love she be find hang in cell at in the morning on june at his majesty prison and young offender institution polmont the problem of prison death be uk wide but these loss be particular problem in scotland and the loss of young people in prison be feel especially research in april by the scottish centre for crime and justice research find that our prison death rate be akin to those in azerbaijan an early study by the council of europe find scotland prison suicide rate be more than two and half time high than the average and about double that of england and wales begin with katie story because focus on her case help make sense of why this problem be so alarming so acute and so avoidable in after night out katie drive home after drink clip the kerb and lose control of her car she have not realise it but she have hit and injure pedestrian she have no previous conviction her victim ask for she not to be give custodial sentence but she be jail for month anyway if anyone deserve second chance after stupid youthful mistake it be katie that second chance be take away because of failing by the scottish prison service we can not mention katie without also mention william brown whom my hon friend the member for glasgow north martin rhodes represent william also die from suicide in polmont the fatal accident inquiry into the loss of both those precious young people find their death to be preventable thank to the sheriff finding the failing of the prison service in these case be now well document detailed and damning one thing out of the page report with its many finding and recommendation especially stick in my mind when we look into prison suicide we learn an awful new vocabulary we come across term such as ligature anchor for william the ligature anchor be bunk bed that the inquiry find could have be remove and bad have be use previously for suicide in the prison in the case of katie the ligature anchor be simple doorstop high up on the wall of her cell doorstop that would have cost few pound to replace small cost for save young life but it be not believe to be worth it year after both death nobody in the prison or the prison service have think to remove the doorstop or to replace they with safe slop alternative the bunk bed have not be remove the fatal accident inquiry into the death find that internal review carry out after both death have not even mention the possibility of remove fixture in cell that could have be use again for further suicide for nothing signify the institutional lack of care more than these failing for which somebody somewhere should have be hold legally responsible before fatal accident inquiry there be an investigation the police and the crown office and procurator fiscal service conclude at first that there be insufficient evidence to prosecute the family of katie and william challenge that conclusion and eventually the authority say that yes there be enough evidence to charge the scottish prison service with breach of the health and safety at work etc act however there be no prosecution why because of crown immunity the health and safety at work etc act place duty on state run prison but crown immunity mean that they can not be prosecute for breach those duty if the two people have die in privately run prison there would have be prosecution in theory individual prison officer can be prosecute but in practice they rarely be when their employer be not also prosecute indeed the reason those prosecution do not happen be that it be argue that individual shortcoming happen in the context of systematic failure in theory the prison service can also be prosecute under corporate manslaughter legislation but in practice they be not because the systematic failing be often judge to take place at the prison level rather than at the senior management level of the overall service those at the bottom pass legal responsibility upwards those at the top pass it back even with the support of the dog campaigner at the charity inquest which focus on state relate death nobody be find legally responsible the good that the family of the lose can hope for in such circumstance be censure by the health and safety executive but even that toothless sanction be almost never use in decade only one prison have receive censure we have be here before three decade ago crown immunity be remove from the nhs and it have have an impact to take one grimly comparable case the essex partnership university nhs foundation trust be fin million for allow suicide after fail to manage the risk cause by ligature point on its estate our prison be responsible for many more such death but they be untouchable because of crown immunity and an untouchable service remain unaccountable institutional impunity remove the incentive for institutional change institutional change that be need at the local scottish level and the uk level locally review of mental health at polmont warn that it need suicide prevention strategy but instead it opt for another review review that be never finish in scotland the human rights commission have warn that recommendation agree decade ago have still not be implement across the scottish prison service just last week the inspector of prison for the whole uk issue an urgent indication warn about condition at pentonville and failure to address repeat concern follow recent suicide without legal consequence prison across the country appear to be incapable of learn lesson or make change every day of immunity bring the risk of more avoidable death the scottish prison service and the government in edinburgh have call for crown immunity to be remove but they need we in this place to do it want to be very clear this campaign should not be use as an excuse for inaction now these place should not have to wait to be prosecute to fulfil their responsibility to protect life but if those run our prison will not act and they have not do so they should lose their protection from legal consequence in conclusion remember friend of mine who lose child say how parent grieve twice for such loss once for the young person know and love and second time for the life that they would have go on to live for katie family the knowledge that she want to live life devote to help and serve other invite they to imagine all the change that she would have make as she grow into adulthood instead of life that would have change the world we in this place be leave with the tragic responsibility of make sure that it be her death that change thing katie extraordinary mother linda tell that she say of her experience in malawi in africa you know mum prayer be great but what people really need be practical help katie family william family and the other who have lose dear love one due to these institutional failing do not need our prayer our sympathy or our condolence they need action they need we to provide the accountability that will avoid future tragedy and change the culture that allow these death that be why it be time to end crown immunity in prison in scotland and across the uk urge member to support my bill question put and agree to order that blair mcdougall and martin rhodes present the bill blair mcdougall accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday september and to be print bill backbench business sir david amess summer adjournment beg to move that this house have consider matter to be raise before the forthcoming adjournment should say for the benefit of new member that this be quite rightly call the sir david amess debate because this be his debate remember poor minister have to respond to he after five minute time limit have be put on speech but he have still manage to raise topic it be his absolute dream to have this debate and somewhere he will be look on and observe what we all have to say may he rest in peace hon member hear hear we seem to be over halfway through yet it seem like only yesterday that we come back from the christmas break in true british style the weather can not decide whether we should have saharan sunshine or tropical rainfall all of which make the tube journey into this place even more of challenge it have be busy few month for parliament and across my constituency have be do my job host resident tour and event speak in the chamber visit school and local business pilot presentation bill and chair the backbench business committee and the committee and finally after year tottenham hotspur have win trophy be pleased that backbench business debate have become very popular with member and it be encouraging that so many have make application to the committee would like to place on record my thank to the committee and the clerks for all the hard work they have do over these past few month we now have waiting list and if anyone apply for debate in the chamber be afraid they will have to wait until before one will be grant because we have such long waiting list thank the leader of the house for meet on occasion to discuss the work that the committee do and to ensure that back benchers have the opportunity to raise their own topic in the true tradition of these adjournment debate will raise the subject of make stanmore station step free we seem to actually be make some progress because queensbury and canons park tube station on the jubilee line be now on the shortlist to get lift that be great news for my resident and cause for some celebration however stanmore station be still not on the list commuter there face the choice of climb step to the main entrance hall step via the car park or step at the side to the bus stop or take the current so call step free route which be metre long and have steep ramp that even the great paralympian tanni grey thompson could not go up unaided transport for london and the mayor consider stanmore station to be step free and will not consider any further work but have discover through freedom of information request that there be no legal definition of step free station it be up to each individual train operate company in this case tfl to determine what it mean take in conjunction with the transport committee excellent report on accessibility issue face by disabled people in the transport sector be now explore how we can get tfl or the government to take action if we can get proper definition of step free agree we can apply pressure on tfl to de list stanmore station as step free so that it meet the requirement to be consider for new lift or travelator the world have never be so dangerous and that be particularly true of london the news that police station front desk will be close not just in harrow but across london be incredibly worrying this come at time when knife and street crime be at an all time high in the capital with total crime increase by this year alone additionally there have be increase in gun crime increase in robbery and whopping increase in business robbery the timing of the decision to cut police station resource be another example of the mayor of london impeccable timing it be important to and our resident that the desk remain open because they provide vital service allow victim to report crime in person and to seek safety will my hon friend give way will not because many member want to get in the justification for these tough choice be the need to address million funding gap yet this be not the right area in which to be cut vital support for year sadiq khan have tell we how much well london would be with labour mayor and labour government but we now have labour mayor and labour government and london be no well as result have create petition call on the mayor to keep harrow police station fully function and urge everyone in my constituency to visit my website and add their name to this important cause tomorrow barnet strategic planning committee will decide whether to approve the broadwalk redevelopment which be proposal for housing unit across tower most of which be above storey high with the high reach storey it would demolish edgware exist bus station bus garage and car park with no guarantee replacement reject this development in its entirety until safe deliverable transport plan can be guarantee the plan currently depend on an underground electric bus garage that the london fire brigade have object to call it very serious safety risk with no exist regulation or precedent tfl have claim that the alternative the diesel fallback be not viable be uncoste and be not support by an engineering plan if the scheme be approve edgware could lose its core transport infrastructure permanently have create petition against these plan which can also be access on my website and urge everyone to sign it we be all very conscious of the escalate situation in the middle east and my prayer be with all those who have be impact the event that have unfold in the middle east since october have be unbearable to witness israel suffer the bad terror attack in its history at the hand of the iran back terrorist hamas innocent civilian be brutally murder and hundred be take hostage include baby child and the elderly the hostage have be hold in appalling condition and the account give by those release have be distress and harrowing only last week welcome keith and aviva siegel into parliament to recount their horrific experience as direct consequence of hamas action on october and their use of civilian infrastructure to undertake terrorist operation palestinian civilian face devastating humanitarian crisis in gaza my thought be with the family of those still hold hostage and every innocent life lose or impact by the conflict firmly support israel right to defend itself against security threat but we must also ensure that the civilian population of gaza be protect it be welcome news that the us have facilitate ceasefire between iran and israel which must be uphold to secure regional security the government and the foreign office must clarify their role in relation to that ceasefire iran must never be allow to obtain nuclear weapon as it be prolific state sponsor of terrorism with state intention of annihilate the world only jewish state my colleague and be clear that the recent action take by the united states alongside israel to degrade iran nuclear weapon programme and military capability be indeed necessary be concerned that the uk have not give strong voice on that outcome the uk face an increasingly complex and concern landscape of malign foreign influence iranian influence in particular have be persistent and insidious in try to harm our civic institution and challenge our democratic resilience one of its shocking tactic be exploitation of our charity sector with such charity have become the nerve centre of the islamic republic of iran on british soil advance foreign policy root in regional destabilisation and ideological extremism it be reveal by united against nuclear iran publish in the times that labaik ya zahra uk register charity base in my constituency go to iran meet senior commander of the islamic revolutionary guard corps and sign an agreement with the propaganda arm of the high military authority of iran regime the head of which be sanction in the uk pledge to spread the ideal of jihad martyrdom and resistance in the uk that be in clear violation of the government foreign influence registration scheme and the national security act as well as violate british sanction yet the charity remain open today hostile state be increasingly test the resilience of our democracy in the light of the recent intelligence and security committee report detail the irgc direct involvement in such threat include plot on uk soil and direct interference in the uk public sector more than parliamentarian have sign letter co lead by and the hon member for bristol north east damien egan to be send to the prime minister today urge the government finally to proscribe the irgc in its entirety it state that should the government decide not to take that essential step they must urgently and immediately put forward for adoption alternative legislative measure as recommend by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation jonathan hall kc to address the grow danger pose by state back threat it be disappointing that the tobacco and vapes bill have stall somewhat in the other place with no set date for its committee there be risk that because the smoke free generation policy in the bill have an implementation date in the bill be not see as urgent that be not the case while we delay tobacco company be market heated tobacco product in supermarket and child be expose to they the marketing be work and child awareness of such product be at an all time high with of to year old know what heated tobacco be up from just three year ago will the minister confirm that the bill be priority for the government and that its committee will begin before the conference recess in the autumn the same be true for nicotine pouch be sure that many hon member will have see when travel into london on the tube brightly colour advert for these product child be see they too with record level of awareness among young people there be currently no age of sale limit for those product so nine year old could legally purchase they will the government put stop to that madness and urgently schedule date for peer to begin scrutinise the tobacco and vapes bill which be overwhelmingly pass by this house this year alone have visit school and know that many colleague will have visit school in their constituency welcome the government commitment to breakfast club for primary schoolchildren but every primary school in my constituency be unable to provide the space for breakfast club to take place so even though they want to implement they they can not be glad to meet the under secretary of state for education the hon member for portsmouth south stephen morgan recently to discuss far how we can achieve that be pleased that the consultation have finally close on the regulation for my supported housing regulatory oversight act hope that that can be spur on to the next stage so that we finally see those measure enact prevent the countless rogue landlord operate in the sector from exploit vulnerable tenant it be my understanding that the deputy prime minister be currently in breach of the law give that she be due to create support housing advisory panel by august we be yet to see that in action and she could literally implement it tomorrow the situation in bangladesh be really concern with the coup that take place and the new regime we have see attack on minority in bangladesh increase have raise this in the house several time yet our foreign commonwealth and development office do not seem to take proper action to call that out for what it be which be an attack on minority similarly we have the horrific terrorist attack in pahalgam and india subsequent counter terrorism action operation sindoor remain deeply appalled and sadden by the barbaric attack on the innocent tourist which claim the life of people include woman and child hindus christians and nepali national my thought be with the victim and their loved one and continue to stand in solidarity with they and the people of india on the response to that it be good that there be currently pause and truce between india and pakistan however that truce be very fragile and there could be return to war as someone who have stand with the kashmiri pandits and their right to return to the kashmir valley and with india sovereign right to defend its people and territory think it be outrageous that such terrorism sponsor by pakistan continue in jammu and kashmir it be therefore right that we stand in solidarity with india last week we hear that the home office would finally be un pausing claim relate to syrian national which be sure we all welcome bring that up because my office have several case that pertain to syrian national in limbo with the home office await update and decision one of which be first bring to my attention nearly two year ago clearly the government home office policy change have create confusion and delay may we therefore have

run thank my constituent new and old who make blaydon and consett fantastic place to be it be an honour to represent this constituency and will continue work every day to ensure that our people have the opportunity they deserve rise to talk about lord anderson report on prevent and the death of our wonderful fall colleague and my dear friend sir david amess which be publish last week it be obviously appropriate to make this speech today in the sir david amess adjournment debate which be rightly name in his honour however it be sad that this speech aim to draw attention to the way in which he and his family have be and be be let down by the home secretary and this government the house be well aware that the sir david amess family would like full statutory public inquiry into the death of their beloved father and husband last march they meet the prime minister and the home secretary at downing street they be support by their former mp anna firth lead london lawyer and public affair expert radd seiger all of whom continue to support and help the family on voluntary basis at that meeting the home secretary and the prime minister ask the family to go away and work with lord anderson to see if he could answer the dozen of question they still have about why the killer slip through the state safeguard net against their well judgement the family do just that they meet lord anderson along with their adviser and anna firth in his chamber in the middle temple they provide lord anderson with all the question that they still need answer and they wait patiently for his report endure several more month of stress and anxiety both the home secretary and lord anderson specifically promise the family that they would see the report first and in good time so that they have time to read and digest it and take advice before be subject to the glare of the medium you can only imagine mr deputy speaker how deeply distress the whole medium circus be for the family unbelievably yet again that do not happen the family first learn that the report be imminent from an article in the guardian and when they receive text from journalist say that the report be due to be publish soon clearly rather than keep their word to the amess family the government choose quite deliberately to leak the report to the press first that be an absolute disgrace the amess family should have see the report first not last that be simply unacceptable way to treat any grieve family let alone that of distinguished parliamentarian once again the amess family be bombard by the medium cause they great pain all the medium want of course be their individual soundbite before the family have any opportunity to even read the page report the home secretary should feel thoroughly ashamed hope that the minister will take this opportunity to apologise to lady amess and her family for this late insult the government really need to do far far well on how they treat the victim of heinous crime critically however there be now no doubt whatsoever follow lord anderson work that there must be full public inquiry on why the string of failure that lead to sir david murder be allow to happen and on who be responsible who will be hold to account and what will be do to ensure that there be no repeat the amess family have be tell repeatedly by the home secretary and successive ministers that lesson have be and would be learn by prevent include the lesson set out in the prevent learning review which take place shortly after sir david death and be publish early this year heartbreakingly southport happen three year later the two case be virtually identical in both the killer be well known to the authority and to the prevent programme yet be allow to slip through the safeguarding net it seem therefore that lesson have not be learn the amess family feel that both the home secretary and the prime minister be pay lip service to their agonising search for real answer when they finally meet they at no in march the family be assure by both the prime minister and the home secretary that they take the family concern extremely seriously that they too feel the loss of sir david acutely and that they would leave no stone unturned to help the family find the answer that they need will finish with the word of katie amess herself before my right hon friend finish will he give way very briefly order no all right sorry will end with the word of katie amess herself sir david be my good friend mr deputy speaker he be order think the father of the house be reach his peroration be fully aware of the friendship between the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois and sir david but he will have the opportunity to make his case shortly in the word of katie amess herself despite lord anderson review the vast majority of our question about prevent failure remain unanswered we still do not know why basic check like social medium monitoring or verify school attendance be not carry out before the perpetrator be release from the programme he be mean to have seven session he have one over cup of coffee at mcdonald and be then release that be simply not good enough yet anderson skate over it ignore the catastrophic consequence that follow for my family and our country critical record include minute from panel meeting and vulnerability assessment have either be withhold or be incomplete that do not help any of we transparency be essential yet we continue to face obstacle in access these document other than the killer himself there have be no accountability for my family the review reveal alarming gap in the handling of the killer after he be refer unsubstantiated claim be make about his suppose progress yet no one have be hold to account this be about process it about people life and our right to see that those who let my dad down be hold fully responsible key individual involve in the case be not interview and the coroner refuse to engage with lord anderson have already refuse we an inquest full statutory inquiry would compel all those involve to give evidence under oath about the failing my dad give his all to this country and yet he and we be be deny the most basic of human right it feel like they be try to hide something to shut this tragedy down statutory public inquiry be the only way to compel witness to testify and document to be disclose on behalf of my family now call on the current home secretary and prime minister to do the right thing and to order the inquiry just as they rightly do for southport they tell my mother and and anna firth that we could come back to no if we be not happy with lord anderson review well we most certainly be not happy with it and will be ask my team to write to they to request that further meeting they promise we public inquiry would honour my father legacy by ensure real accountability and prevent future tragedy lastly my father dedicate his life to public service the very least he deserve be thorough investigation into how his murder could have be prevent we owe it to he and to every potential future victim to get this right we have have review after review since my father die we now call for public inquiry let right be do it would be remiss of not to pay tribute to that exceptional and powerful speech from the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh be sure those in authority will have listen carefully to his remark will be very brief want to pay tribute to sir david amess an issue dear to his heart that he speak about frequently be hepatitis patient and that be what want to speak about hope the house will agree that it be timely and appropriate occasion because next monday july be world hepatitis day sir david amess be most powerful advocate for hepatitis patient and member of the all party parliamentary group on liver health if it be not presumptuous may draw member attention to early day motion which have table would like to say few thing about this condition hepatitis be blood bear virus that disproportionately affect disadvantaged and marginalise community it be preventable treatable and curable indeed the united kingdom have already commit to achieve the world health organisation goal of eliminate hepatitis as public health concern by that would have huge impact on health inequality it would be encouraging if the uk government be to celebrate world hepatitis day on july by reaffirm their commitment to meet the who target and if that be reinforce by comprehensive hepatitis elimination action plan many people do not realise that they have hepatitis but if leave untreated it can cause fatal cirrhosis and even liver cancer the effort of our nhs and harm reduction service have lead to considerable success in finding engage test and treat people who be at risk the uk be within reach of meet the world health organisation target of hepatitis elimination by that would be tremendous public health achievement for government who be committed to address health inequality and public health issue but to sustain the success that we have have so far we must overcome stigma avoid complacency and support effective effort and commitment to achieve positive public health outcome be delighted to have be call in the debate on the summer adjournment which be very pleased be now traditionally know as the sir david amess debate after our fall comrade and great friend sir david follow the brilliant speech by the father of the house my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh all would say be that this matter be very close to the heart of the amess family if it be not possible to have separate public inquiry which be what they desperately would like perhaps as my right hon friend allude to the other alternative be to slightly amend the term of reference of the southport inquiry so that the matter could be investigate via those mean the additional cost would be miniscule and the family could have their say merely repeat that request perhaps the most pressing issue in wickford in my constituency be the fate of the old dilapidated co op supermarket site it be purchase several year ago by an overseas developer name heriot which singularly fail to find new tenant in fairness it attempt to negotiate deal with morrison which fall through it instead try to negotiate deal with asda which fall through too be afraid that in the recent wickford park by election the labour party claim in its literature that deal with asda have be secure and it be thus try to take the credit in fact it turn out that that be simply untrue recently receive letter from mr allan leighton the chief executive of asda which unfortunately confirm that after over year of negotiation it have reluctantly decide not to proceed with the redevelopment of the wickford site have to say that that have not enhance asda in my eye nevertheless back in february heriot apply to basildon borough council for planning permission for new store but the council repeatedly drag its foot and fail to determine the application to the point that understand developer could appeal to the planning inspectorate on the ground of non determination it be absolutely vital that that planning application be pass by basildon borough council in the hope that heriot can find an alternative tenant such as lidl or another supermarket group have try for nearly four year to achieve that if heriot be not able to do so perhaps the time have finally come for it to sell the site to an alternative developer with more experience which might have more luck either way can report to the house that my constituent be thoroughly feed up with the whole drama of the old co op supermarket as be for the sake of all my constituent in wickford hope that we can somehow bring this prolonged saga to successful conclusion and provide they with new supermarket fit for the century let end my contribution with few remark on so call devolution and local government reform this have be torturous process in essex make more difficult by the fact that there be absolutely no public demand at all for the change can confidently report to the house that in year as an essex mp have never once have constituent tell on the doorstep that they want mayor of essex none the less ministers recently write to essex mps to confirm that they be go ahead with mayor of essex loosely base on the sadiq khan model in london with related combined authority that will result in mayoral election across the whole of essex in spring next year the government proposal would in effect replace the current two tier system with another two tier system at present we have essex county council as the upper tier and low tier of district borough and city council under the government plan that would give way to an upper tier of an elect mayor and combine authority with low tier of multiple unitary authority beneath the third tier of town and parish council would remain unaffected however it be not yet clear whether the labour government still intend to press ahead with their plan to create several unitary authority in essex matter that have lead to much consternation and considerable disagreement not least among the potential constituent authority themselves as of today there be multiple different potential configuration essex county council seem to want three unitary authority rochford district council and some other council would prefer four the labour party appear to be agitate in favour of five contrary to the position of its own party labour lead thurrock council have just announce that it would prefer four the constituent local authority of which it be yet to reveal indeed at meeting of council leader early this week some labour council leader be openly disagree with each other over all this the whole process be rapidly descend into total farce and have follow this issue closely for many year have yet to hear truly compelling case for why any of these new authority would genuinely be more efficient as ever we be promise efficiency saving in year but as former minister have to tell current ministers from long experience that year never come to conclude say in all sincerity to ministers that if they press ahead regardless and impose solution via ministerial order with no consensus it will still take parliament to implement in the meantime local government will almost grind to halt and many of the good officer will leave it definitely will not save the money that have be promise and therefore the game simply be not worth the candle if could offer ministers in the department some honest advice it would be this pull stump now while you can if you must go ahead with the mayor do that but drop the unitary idea and let the local district borough and city council get on with the job of represent their people and let we have election for those council child be of the population but of our future see that every time visit school in newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend we know that the first few year of child life be crucial lay the foundation for their overall development for that reason be delighted that battle hill primary school in wallsend be in the initial cohort to benefit from the government expansion of school base nursery that school be in one of the most deprived area of the ward and have always do fantastic job of support family it previously have sure start facility and as someone who use to be ward councillor and governor be always proud to say that it care for child from birth to year be excited to say that that be the aspiration once again to remain on the topic of our young people the north east mayoral combine authority recently approve an million investment for the expansion of the energy academy in my constituency the offshore energy industry along the tyne be source of enormous pride the tyne be open for business and the expansion of the energy academy only strengthen that case that funding will be use to create new energy campus triple the number of student who will be able to enrol each year the offshore renewable energy sector be set to create an additional job in manufacturing and engineering along the river over the next decade it be right that young person grow up in any of the ward in my constituency should have the opportunity to compete for new green job however if company and local official be move the earth to ensure that the job and investment be there we can not allow obstacle to get in the way when say obstacle mean it in the literal sense for eight year have lead campaign to remove the power cable over the tyne which be barrier to business secure work for large renewable energy structure last year the institute for public policy research identify newcastle as the travel to work area with the third high green potential in britain however the current situation put at risk possible net gross value add benefit of up to billion it have be propose that the removal of the cable will be complete in that be too late the race for green job be now over the year few have champion tyneside industrial strength as powerfully as the shepherd family and take this opportunity to thank they for their tireless work the employment they have create along the tyne be commendable and they have convene some of the sharp mind in the private sector to help solve some of the big problem we face welcome walker north inclusion in the list of trailblazer neighbourhood announce at the spending review that area will receive up to million over the next decade to support its renewal and look forward to work with the community to ensure that that funding be use where it be need as chair of the responsible vaping all party parliamentary group remain concerned that effort to reduce the number of smoker continue to plateau action on smoking and health research that of adult in britain smoke and that this figure have remain at the same level since be alarming over half of adult who smoke and who would benefit from switch completely to vape wrongly believe that it be equally as harmful as smoking or even more harmful hope that when the tobacco and vapes bill return later this year that misperception about relative harm will not be make bad encourage the government to make clear in other health relate announcement that vaping be safe option for smoker look to quit will end on happy and congratulatory note recently table two early day motion celebrate the hard work of individual who have dedicate their life to public service the first motion applaud dame norma redfearn after long and successful life in education and as the elect mayor of north tyneside the long

for nearly year of the all party parliamentary group on the kurdistan region in iraq mp use his experience as cross party and transnational activist and the group help build strong kurdish british relationship such people in public life can inspire other and advance the common good before begin may associate myself with the remark from the father of the house my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh in respect of public inquiry for sir david will raise an important issue that have be raise on number of occasion by member private management company their management of housing estate and the outrageous charge that they make the land management firm greenbelt manage the open space of scartho top in the part of grimsby that represent many resident of scartho top have

the unfairness of subset of resident be tie into pay estate charge for public space some of the charge that my constituent have highlight include tree work at cost of plant work at cost of site

highlight by the competition and markets authority follow its study into house building as ministers will be aware the cma call on the government to implement mandatory adoption of public amenity on new housing estate note that the government response to the cma study state that while they welcome the cma work they intend to consult publicly on the good way to bring the injustice of fleecehold private estate and unfair cost to an end they intend to gather evidence to supplement the cma report understand the government will be invite view from range of expert and hope that can be conclude quickly the cma also call for the introduction of enhance consumer protection measure underpin by robust enforcement regime for household live under private management arrangement these measure would include increase the amount of information that homeowner be entitle to receive to understand what they be pay for introduce right to challenge the reasonableness of housing management charge at the first tier tribunal in england or at leasehold valuation tribunal in wales and give homeowner the right to apply to tribunal to appoint manager in the event of serious failure the government accept those recommendation in principle while highlight that secondary legislation be require to implement they once again public consultation would be require finally on this topic note that the minister for housing and planning the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook make clear in write ministerial statement on the issue during the winter that we need to act as quickly as feasible

burslem know what the industry mean to local family and have keep my word by press ministers for support whenever have have the opportunity include in westminster hall debate that secure back in march be pleased that ceramic be now recognise as foundation industry in the industrial strategy and that support with electricity cost will come in but will continue to raise with ministers the need for additional support for the sector between now and then meanwhile too many of our historic building still lie empty decay and increasingly beyond repair but with the right support many could be bring back into use they could be convert into affordable high quality home that protect our heritage meet urgent housing need and help to sustain our high street and town centre under labour we must go far and fast to make that reality and urge the relevant ministers to proactively engage with to look at what step can be take would welcome visit to my constituency so that they can see its potential at

neighbourhood across stoke on trent north and kidsgrove rise order we be begin to play beat the clock understand that the right hon member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay have some important information about the restoration and renewal of the palace of westminster that be sure member will wish to hear so do not propose to impose time limit immediately after he have speak shall impose time limit of five minute hide in plain sight but not discuss in this chamber since the general election be the spending of million of pound on the repair of this building with member expect to commit later this year to spend billion of pound into the future the lack of debate or any meaningful transparency come despite the majority of member of this house be newly elect last july instead the detailed cost and any vote on option be be delay until later this year ironically they will probably come at around the same time that the house be expect to vote on budget which many people expect to include tax rise member of the house and member of the public might reasonably ask why the leader of the house have not hold any such debate since come into office this issue speak to wide principle be decision well formulate in private when some of the number remain uncertain with reliance place on internal control and external adviser give assurance or be it well to have transparency not least on an issue of great public interest lesson that as minister learn from covid be that it be well to have transparency and an open debate about the trade off early than to hold discussion in secret and allow the benefit of hindsight after the event support great transparency have be theme of my time in the house whether in my initial four year on the public accounts committee or when as minister overrule official advice to disclose information to the national audit office during covid since be elect as chair of the house finance committee have repeatedly raise concern in private about the financial management of the house and the multibillion pound restoration and renewal programme but feel it be necessary to raise these issue on the floor of the house today before do so place on record my thank to mr speaker because know he care deeply about taxpayer value an issue he have champion on many occasion want to reassure member that will not disclose any information have receive in my role as chair of the finance committee or in private capacity the crux of the issue be that there need to be complete reset of the and programme the book need to be open to the public and we need to bring the public into the debate about how we balance the need of world heritage site with modern security accessibility for example for those with disability and value for money update cost need to be present currently million of pound be be spend work up multiple option despite our now be in the fifth year of this work indeed those option be gold plat often base on decision take by member who be no long in the house there be remarkably little visibility of this issue the most recent cost present go back to and even then the cheap option be billion to billion with other cost more and that be without inflation and with no other significant addition those cost exclude the work member will see on the northern estate which be not part of the and programme yet the public would associate the two not least because that work be key part of any decant we also know that there be precedent for cost increase massively if we take the example of the elizabeth tower the most recent example in this house the cost start at million and finish at million which be increase if we look at this morning news we can see how the cost of sizewell have increase there be know risk in plain sight in its first report the national audit office cite change to programme as key risk yet we know that the sponsor body set up at the start have be scrap we know that we start with one option and then go up to two and then three but with and option so in essence we have four option who know but there could be fifth on the way the governance be opaque let give the house an example the key body that oversee the programme have meet only once this year and only twice since the last annual report however if we look at what be in the public domain the first paragraph of the annual report say that the client board and programme board will mean sufficiently robust and detailed information will be available to the new parliament to support decision on the way forward for we have not debate it once and the govern committee have meet only once this calendar year be conscious of the time so will canter through some of the other issue in short security be often present as reason for not be transparent but would draw member attention to the very welcome intervention by baroness smith in the house of lords in her exchange with lord hayward about the carriage gates which cost million be tell that they still do not work particularly well just last week this house debate mistake that be make by an official in the ministry of defence with member complain about both the cost to the taxpayer and whether that be cover up how confident be member that no similar example exist simply ask members be they aware of the cost of the work on the northern estate of the trade off and how they be be shape or of the cost of any delay how confident be they that when they be ask to make such decision alongside budget they will have the information they need will finish with one final example just as with high speed hide something in plain sight involve produce lot of brochure and lot of literature colleague can see that one of the recent quarterly update state on page surveys ongoing budget ongoing develop house of commons plans ongoing costed proposal ongoing invitation to tender not start it include no meaningful information indeed the annual report have financial information only on the final two page page and this be not new issue lord morse in his report note parliament have historically poor reputation for its contract management and commercial acuman believe issue should be share with the public the trade off discuss and member of this house particularly new member give sight of these issue have call repeatedly in private for there to be great debate today want to do so on the floor of the house it be huge honour to speak in the sir david amess summer adjournment debate my one story about sir david relate to late friend of mine julian ware lane who be often the labour candidate who stand against he in general election sadly many year ago julian be diagnose with cancer and spend long period of time in hospital sir david often visit

in the tradition of use these debate to highlight issue face constituent sir david amess set high bar in make the most of his opportunity to champion his constituent and while we come from different political tradition respect the example that he set let we start with road safety over the last year have raise serious concern about rural road throughout my constituency have highlight dangerous junction on the and recently back arlington parish council campaign to improve safety on the rural road around arlington and upper dicker elsewhere community have be leave to take matter into their own hand those live along the which run through kingston rodmell piddinghoe southease iford and swanborough have raise more than just to fund feasibility study as part of the safe campaign the fact that community be have to crowdfund for something as fundamental as road safety speak volume it be damn indictment of national government failure to deliver the infrastructure that our village and rural community need let now turn to the issue of housing and planning housing remain one of the great pressure face my community too many family be stick in temporary accommodation while genuinely affordable home remain out of reach in area such as mine we urgently need high quality housing in which people can actually afford to live at the same time we see poor planning decision and underused site waste precious opportunity have raise the case of talland parade in seaford directly with ministers as prime example of what happen when developer be allow to bank brownfield site in town centre to the detriment of community be hopeful that promise new power in the planning and infrastructure bill will give local authority the power to act at last on case such as this we do need new home but they must come with the infrastructure to support they along with proper consultation with local resident and focus on affordability be glad that my local district council listen to local concern and choose not to include the eton new town proposal in its draft local plan that be absolutely the right decision speculative large scale development of that kind drop into rural area without proper infrastructure or consultation do not serve our community meanwhile village such as ringmer be be bombard with constant stream of individual housing application with no investment in road school or healthcare to match that be not plan it be place pressure on community that be already at break point transport provision be key to make planning decision welcome last week news of direct rail service from eastbourne to london bridge via polegate berwick glynde lewes and cooksbridge which be step in the right direction for rail connectivity across the south east but like many of my constituent in the area be very unhappy to learn that it would not stop at plumpton my constituent deserve well than to be leave behind in major transport decision and will be object to the rail operator gtr and to the department for transport in the strong term finally constituent regularly raise with the ongoing and unacceptable closure of the west beach in newhaven the only stretch of sandy beach in our area even nearby coastal town such as the aforementioned and wonderous eastbourne can not match up to our sandy stretch in newhaven shut off by newhaven port properties which be partly control by the french authority this treasured local space have be out of bound to resident for too long have engage directly with those responsible to demand answer and to push for the beach to be reopen this be not just about stretch of sand it be about fairness local pride and the right of community to enjoy what should be share public asset generation of local family have memory of happy summer spend on that beach they should not have to look back wistfully they should be able to return to it we will keep fight to reopen the west beach enough be enough none of these problem exist in isolation the issue of road safety gp access and housing all reveal deep failure of governance over many year will keep work with my local constituent resident and campaign group to get real change on the issue that matter and to provide genuine representation for resident in seaford newhaven lewes polegate and every village that represent portion of southend west be represent by david amess and call the new mp for the area it be not lose on that have huge shoe to fill in this place as stand here represent the constituency that be sir david amess send my thought to his wife lady julia and all the family and hope that we can find way to give they the answer that they need this be my second year of contribute to the sir david amess summer adjournment debate and the last year have go so quickly but the passage of time have not erode the memory of sir david amess many member on both side of the house and many people in my constituency will never forget he he be very much miss in my constituency tony martin who run the chalkwell lifeguard station set up temporary memorial to sir david with lot of picture from his life and his time in parliament it be fantastic temporary display and be delighted that over the last couple of month have be able to work with lady julia and some of sir david team to put in place permanent display on the wall of the lifeguard station thank everybody who have be involve in that project of course one of sir david legacy be that his death lead to southend become city every city need cathedral and have be try to get one but it be prove difficult because chelmsford have one and there can only be one per diocese however be work with the bishop of bradwell to see what we can do about give special recognition to the historic st mary church where sir david have his southend funeral hope that we can get this over the line and that will get the support of the church commissioners in make it happen want quickly to recognise the charity trust link base in my constituency which turn year old couple of week ago its chief executive officer matt king and its founder cheryl higgins have do absolutely fantastic work in transform derelict plot of land in westcliff into an outstanding project which tackle loneliness and social isolation through range of different activity the staff there work on mental health as well it be true example of what the government want to do in move from hospital to the community we have be strike by two tragedy in southend over the last couple of week want to recognise the death of seven year old leonna ruka who be kill by fall tree in chalkwell park on june send my sympathy to her family on sunday july we have the plane crash at southend airport again send my thought to the family of the four people who be kill sincerely thank the emergency service southend on sea city council and its leader councillor daniel cowan the airport staff and the airport ceo jude winstanley for everything they have do on both of these tragedy over the last couple of week most importantly thank the amazing southend community who have come out lay flower and pay tribute to the family it have be absolutely heartbreaking to see what have happen over the last couple of week this be the end of my first year as an mp and it have be an absolute privilege and honour to serve the people of southend west and leigh we have achieve lot and there be plenty more to come be look forward to it and wish all member in this house very happy and pleasant summer recess it be an honour to contribute to the sir david amess summer adjournment debate shall limit myself to topic that be very important for my constituency of ceredigion preseli the future of coastal rural economy shall make the case for renew emphasis and focus on the redevelopment and regeneration of those economy not least because that would go long way to address the government aspiration for growth across the united kingdom but also because it would help address demographic trend that already pose severe challenge for the provision of public service in those area and that if leave unarrested could become critical ceredigion preseli like many other constituency have an age population the trend be particularly pronounce in my constituency accord to the office for national statistics if current trend continue of the population of pembrokeshire and third of the population of ceredigion will be old than by the year which be just year away need not explain to hon member just how challenging it will to not only maintain the vibrancy of our community but ensure effective provision of the wide range of public service that any civilised community and society expect in renew emphasis focus and perhaps even strategy on rural and coastal economy the government would do well to recognise the importance of small business to these community in ceredigion preseli some of our over business be classify as small business and have few than employee this be quite typical for rural area where small business especially in the agricultural hospitality tourism and leisure sector drive the local economy it would be very welcome if the government look again at policy that use to be in place be tell yesterday by former civil servant that back in the tony blair government one stage in the development of any policy in whitehall be call rural proofing consideration of the impact of the policy on rural context if that have be reintroduce do not think we would have have the inheritance tax change to agricultural property relief and business property relief which be already cause great concern accord to report by confederation of british industry economics it be estimate that of family business and of farm business be cancel propose investment project in anticipation of those change small business in rural and coastal area need little bit of hope and confidence from this government rural proofing as stage in policy development and dedicated strategy for the redevelopment of rural area would go some way to restore that faith in the short time have leave will touch briefly on the importance of our high education sector university and high education institution must play critical role in any strategy for ensure growth across every part of the united kingdom in my constituency some job be support by its university that be of all job and it be real concern that we hear so little about university current quandary rise order be try my good to get everybody in so the speak limit be now three minute wish to pay tribute to the late sir david amess do not have the privilege of meet he but his reputation clearly precede he as do that of the late jo cox be member of the speaker conference and we be do all we can to propose the change need and get the culture shift require to deter and prevent the intimidation of candidate and elect official at all level so that our precious democracy can thrive that be particularly vital if we be to encourage young people to get involve in our political system the doom monger be wrong about our young people far from be problem they be our great natural resource one that be often under utilise and that we must unleash have try to do this in my constituency include by hold pitch your policy event young people pitch in one minute the one new policy idea or law change that they would bring in there be then two minute of question from the audience follow by vote some lack confidence other come to the event straight from basketball session good illustration of the fact that we need to go to the place where young people be and listen take the win idea to the chamber where the leader of the house respond to it and thank she for that we should bring the voice of young people into the corridor of power because young people be genuinely interested in their community their life their country and definitely our world they have excellent idea to bring to the fore they be go to inherit the future we have well encourage they to engage with politic so that they can be the architect of that future rather than merely exist in world design by generation past who have to put it politely singularly fail to create world of opportunity for all our young people the voice of young people be not be hear enough the focus be all too often elsewhere for example we hear much noise about the alleged attack on pensioner by the government if we zoom out and look down from outer space we would see it be actually the young generation who have be neglect by government of all stripe young people do not get triple lock they should they be the generation for whom buy their own home be out of reach and they have far less job security than previous generation early in the week in social medium video ask people to leave comment say what change old generation would need to make for the young generation to have more influence in politic and lead an empower life mccaslin say we need the same opportunity that the generation before we have they dismantle the ladder they use to build their life and then tell we to figure it out like they do when people say to do do politic my response be well politic do you if you not involve you cede the ground to those who understand the power of politic have be proud to be part of government who be rectify that finally want to say in the limited time have leave thank you to all member of this house and all staff they have show newbie like only support and kindness the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale epitomise that good example from this generation to the next pay tribute to sir david amess wish to speak about number of transport issue relate to my constituency early this month have the pleasure of welcome the rail minister to ashford where we attend the opening of new career and skill hub for southeastern after the opening take the minister on tour of ashford international station and the part of the station leave abandon since eurostar decide in that international rail service would no long stop at either ashford or ebbsfleet those part of the station stand ready for international passenger to use once again it be great to have the noble lord hendy reiterate his and the government support for our campaign to have international rail service return to kent in my year in the house the other transport issue have raise just as regularly as the return of international rail to ashford be the deployment of operation brock on the be sorry that it be necessary to present petition to the house on the subject last week on behalf of my constituent it be hugely disappointing that kent county council and the kent and medway resilience forum have introduce operation brock once again and that it will remain in force until at least august the recent announcement that the dart charge will increase from september have disappoint many of my constituent if we take that together with the toll now in place for the blackwall and silvertown tunnel the result be that all those route will now cost more we should of course encourage people to take public transport wherever we can and recognise that the charge be in place to manage traffic number however many of my constituent will have no option but to pay the increase charge as they have only one route to work available to they pothole be blight on the road in my constituency just as they be in the constituency of most member it be wrong that as result of under investment by the conservatives our constituent have be expect to deal with the repercussion of poor road and the maintenance backlog that have build up welcome the fact that the government be commit additional resource to fix this problem they be provide million in extra funding for highway maintenance across the country this year and kent county council will receive up to an additional million if those problem be to be fix there will of course need to be roadwork but plead on behalf of my constituent for much well co ordination to ensure that any disruption be keep to minimum conclude by thank you madam deputy speaker as well as mr speaker all my colleague and the staff of this house it be an honour to speak in my second sir david amess adjournment debate and to speak of my constituency of carlisle and the incredible roman dig there that be rewrite our understanding of britain ancient history carlisle or as the romans call it luguvalium be no ordinary outpost it be strategic stronghold on the northern frontier of the roman empire and serve as key military and logistical hub guard the western end of hadrian wall and control movement between roman britain and the unconquered land of caledonia the city bear witness to the march of legion the clash of culture and the daily life of soldier merchant and their family who live on the edge of the empire now thank to this dig nearly year later we be uncover their story one layer at time the roman dig at carlisle cricket club have reveal not just one of the most significant roman bathhouse ever discover in britain but the large building on hadrian wall as well as evidence to suggest that the site may have host the roman emperor severus in his final year since this volunteer lead community excavation have unearth more than artefact from coin and pottery to tiny delicate gemstone and huge carve stone head these find tell we not just about roman engineering or military might but about people their habit belief luxury and loss carlisle roman past be not distant memory it be alive beneath our foot it remind we that history be about more than king and battle it be about community resilience and the endure human spirit which be exactly what we have hear about in all our community this afternoon invite member to join in thank all the volunteer involve in the dig lead by the wonderful frank giecco from wardell armstrong and all make possible thank to funding from the government cumberland council and the national lottery heritage fund together they be not just uncover roman carlisle but remind we that we be but fleeting custodian

father in law last month he be wise kind and decent man and will be miss by we all be grateful to all colleague for the kindness show to and my wife although do remain very very cross that be force to travel back to this place to vote on the day that my father in law die member who have be accuse of criminal behaviour can vote by proxy but people with die relative can not that be off the mark it be

conscious of that responsibility every single day in my maiden speech make tackle walley quarry landfill site my no priority we run the cowboy operator out of town secure the closure notice and close the place down be grateful to the environment agency for the work it have do in recent week to stabilise the situation our focus must now be on the safe and secure restoration of the site the special educational need and disability crisis in staffordshire have be firmly on my agenda since the election have stand with and up for the parent and carer who must navigate broken system every day to get their child and young people the support they need and deserve fix our road have also be real priority that be why launch my great pothole survey empower local people to help hold the county council to account we have see action on lower milehouse lane in cross heath pepper street in silverdale and dunkirk in the town centre but we need much more hope that those on the county council who seemingly watch lot of my speech in the chamber will listen to my call to use the money that this labour government have give they to get on with the job the event in the middle east be unforgivable and inexplicable the death of innocent woman man and child on our screen be beyond comprehension be raise to believe that action have consequence so urge ministers to do whatever they can to hold the netanyahu regime to account to ensure that this war end and to recognise the state of palestine two state solution require two state it be simple as that last week have the opportunity to attend one

live act can barely break even on music stream and venue be close many act operate in pay to play environment lose money every time they play while pay to play be indicative of fail industry its existence have long be true in small venue for small band but understand that this year glastonbury be pay to play even for some of the big act indeed the independent recently report that one act have spend of their own money on glastonbury set while small act be offer just to play one of the small stage and not even give enough ticket to cover the whole band this be deeply unsustainable system that freeze out all but those with the private mean to pay their own way it be kill our creativity madam deputy speaker have you notice how in recent year there have be rise in the number of solo artist and decline in the number of band in my view the effect be bear out of not only change in music taste but simple economic if promoter be pay to an act to play solo act take home while five

extraction under the ground to wind energy off the coast cornwall be ready to play its part in the new economy the task be vast but the prize be priceless energy security which reduce our dependence on volatile international market climate action which secure the material we need for clean technology and job and regeneration in our cornish celtic community which will bring back high quality

difference such toilet make be life change one say for and my family it the difference between live your life or close down your world do my hon friend agree that we have to do all we can to enhance and get more of these facility across the whole of the country absolutely as will turn to know that at first hand as the parent of child with cerebral palsy the growth of change place mean that it be make an impact but the fact be that we need more of these toilet across the country commend the hon gentleman for bring forward this debate speak to he beforehand to get an idea of what he be try to achieve and want to congratulate he on his campaign well do every one of we in our constituency wish we have someone push as hard as he be with his campaign say that because in northern ireland we have only change place toilet per people which mean we rank the second low in the uk after london the hon gentleman be do so much here and we have lot to learn some people in northern ireland require additional room for assistance and support when use public restroom facility do the hon gentleman agree that give that this issue impact thousand across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we must ensure that enough change place toilet be provide in all nation for all people with disability absolutely and thank the hon member as will come on to say we have see such growth particularly in central london but that need to be replicate across the united kingdom access to change places toilet allow anyone regardless of their access need or disability to use toilet with dignity privacy and hygienically do my hon friend agree that accessible toilet keep people out long encourage spending make town more inclusive and be critical for retail tourism and local growth when council close they disabled people and young family just stay at home do he agree that it be short sighted of the conservative council in north warwickshire to fail to fulfil its promise to reopen accessible toilet in atherstone town centre we need more change place toilet up and down this country so that everyone regardless of their ability or who their child be can make the most of their day out absolutely and thank my hon friend for those comment again will come on to talk about toilet that be close in my own constituency and the impact that have will try to make some progress for moment change places toilet be specifically design for people with profound and multiple disability and their carer who need more space and equipment than standard accessible toilet provide the feature include height adjustable adult sized change bench ceiling track hoist and space for multiple carer ensure safe and dignified experience the change places consortium be establish year ago as have say and at the heart of its campaign which be initiate by the late loretto lambe the founder and chief executive of pamis promote more inclusive society be the aim to ensure the growth of change place across the country wish to pay tribute to the work of change place staff and volunteer lead by jenny miller and karen hoe and their vital support in ensure this debate could be bring to the house currently the total number of active and register change places toilet be span the uk and service leisure centre city and town centre shopping centre venue hospital transport hub stadium and attraction last year new change places be instal across the uk the high number of annual registration ever want to add personal note of thank to my hon friend for be such an outstanding advocate for family such as ours we share strong union on that point do he agree that it be not enough just to have change place facility because it be also important for staff in those area to have have training so that they know how to direct people to it reflect on that the other weekend when we go to splash park have see that it have change place facility which be amazing however when we ask the person open the café who allow we to go in how we could access the change places facility they just do not know which make it inaccessible do he agree that it be so important that training be give to staff where there be change place facility so that they can adequately direct people to it agree absolutely with my hon friend we work very closely together on these issue as parent of disabled child will turn to such training in relation to some of my own horror story in due course in may pamis announce that it be update its change places practical guidance resource that help support the design and management of change place toilet think miss out that there be toilet year ago so there have be significant growth since that time should also note the change make by the previous government when they amend the building regulations under which it be now compulsory for some new large building to have change place toilet instal in they in addition change places toilet fund of million be make available in which have provide change place across england have see the real impact that that growth have have in london and the home county as south east london mp see that now in central london as compare with year ago in train station at cultural venue along the south bank and very recently in oxford street the campaign spearhead by bromley resident katrina who work with before be elect to this place have allow an increase in toilet in park hospital and coastal town to ensure her family my family and other family can have the day out that other take for grant thank my hon friend for give way and congratulate he on secure this important debate it be typically human focused compassionate and decent which sum he up in every way will he join in highlight the current change place toilet in newcastle under lyme at keele service on the southbound morrisons the jubilee gym and sport centre and our local library that be four but we need many more and government have an important role to play in make that happen thank my hon friend absolutely agree we have see that growth but we need to see more thank my hon friend for give way be very sad to report that there be no change place toilet in my constituency on the website not single one believe that actually congleton leisure centre do have change place toilet and believe that ruby fund also have very extensive disabled facilitate toilet although not to change places standard do he agree that when have constituency of people with four town and multiple village that be an appalling state of affair and we need to do well thank my hon friend be happy to work with she and her local authority to bring site forward will now talk about my own family experience and in particular about education fully accept that not every disability be visible many people who may appear not to have disability do require change place toilet for instance if they have colostomy bag and require extra space for toilete for those who need change place toilet the current system can be very frustrating the main way of find where one be locate be through the excellent search location tool and map this be just refer to on the change place website there be separate app but it be not run by change place it be run by third party and so be not as up to date the information on the change places website can only be up to date if the provider of the toilet advise of any change in availability could give litany of experience as could my hon friend the member for thurrock jen craft of where thing have sadly not work one of our daughter have quadriplegic cerebral palsy she be wheelchair user she be unable to tell you when she need the toilet and be still in nappy at almost year of age give her height and weight change bed be essential to change she with dignity before we be aware of the change places website we sadly have the indignity of change she in variety of place such as on bench or behind bush to try to give she some dignity our fallback today remain the floor of our wheelchair accessible van which can assure you be backbreaker since we have be aware of the change places map facility we plan our day out trip and travel arrangement around it and where we believe there will be toilet it have be life changer for our family and as we have hear for other family there be occasion where because the information have not be update or because of lack of training on what change place toilet be we have have some experience that have be not so great find that the only change place toilet in the place you be visit have be close because it be vandalise find that the change place toilet in building be not available as it be be use as storage cupboard have council staff member refuse someone who clearly can not walk and be clearly in nappy access to the change place toilet on the ground that they be child and should therefore use baby change table even when it be clear that their height and particularly their weight would break the table find because it be winter that the council have close the toilet entirely or when visit busy coastal city that it close at pm because clearly disabled people do not need to use the toilet after pm have see some terrible training of staff in train station and in public building where they do not understand what change places toilet be on numerous occasion have be tell that because my daughter be wheelchair user she should use the standard disabled toilet with no understanding that she can not stand and there be no hoist in standard disabled toilet and that if someone use nappy you might need bed to change they there be one occasion in central london train station when toilet attendant make everyone regardless of which toilet they require join one queue because their objective be reduce the queue length rather than ensure that the people who be able to use the only toilet available to they do so as we stand patiently at about number in the queue people in front of we who do not need the change place toilet be in turn direct to it there be however some fantastic instance of staff ensure that those try to use these toilet as baby change room which happen lot do not do so and example of fantastic signage explain what change places toilet be intend for along with the people who believe change places toilet be in fact large baby change facility one other issue that can cause problem be the easy availability of radar key which be often purchase on the internet or in high street shop be afraid that some people do buy they as way of skip toilet queue in number of place include in bexleyheath town centre in my constituency the use of radar key have lead to people sleep on the change bed and someone move themselves and all their belonging into the toilet my council take the decision to close the toilet because of the repeat damage cause by the person who keep move into it although would argue that the council be clearly not maintain it adequately give that someone have be live in it for several week before my own wife discover that they be live there those issue persist and we therefore need to have conversation about training about spread good practice on signage and about different entry system which number of change place toilet now have those thing would greatly reduce the stress for those who genuinely need change place toilet will my hon friend give way very quickly you have have your go already laughter very much appreciate my hon friend give way again do he agree that when you go somewhere and you be unable to access adequate facility to change your child the message that be send to you and your family be you be not welcome here we do not want you conversely when you go somewhere that have change place facility you feel welcomed and part of the community that be absolutely the case we will visit the same place for day out and we know our routine in central london because we know where we will be welcome and where we have have those bad experience which have mention we do of course also need to consider this place we have change place toilet in the lower waiting hall which be of the very old original standard it be therefore difficult to hoist somebody on to the bed give how low the ceiling be there be however no facility for visitor to portcullis house which be something we need to consider go forward in my constituency there be one change place toilet locate in the broadway shopping centre but we need more hall place would be fantastic place to have one give that it be the premier cultural attraction and open space in my constituency there be four change place toilet in my constituency which give that it be one of england large constituency still feel very inadequate do my hon friend agree that one sector where we would definitely benefit from more change place toilet be in our visitor attraction do he support my call for english heritage to increase the number of change place facility on its estate absolutely agree as my hon friend say be pretty sure that there be some in her constituency but we do need to expand that have those facility on the south bank have make such an impact culturally can tell you madam deputy speaker we have just two change place toilet in my constituency which be semi rural and quite large one be at elvaston castle country park so ask my hon friend to put that on his list of place to come and visit open my constituency office only once have disabled access toilet but it just feel like such halfway house do my hon friend agree that two change place toilet for constituency as large as south derbyshire be far from adequate absolutely agree with my hon friend who have one more than in her constituency we do need to expand the number that we have recently meet member of my local bexley mencap who raise with the need for change place toilet in one of my borough swimming pool we have three swimming pool in my local authority area and it can be very difficult for member to change themselves however campaigning can work for many year have question the rationale of eurotunnel leshuttle have change place toilet in folkestone but not have one for the very same customer in calais accept that change place toilet be very uncommon in france in fact could count they on one hand however after many year of be tell that one could not be provide in calais have be advise in the past month that one will be supply although eurotunnel be be vague about the installation date those customer will now finally be able to use change place toilet on both leg of their journey know that my hon friend the member for hyndburn sarah smith want to be here to pay tribute to her constituent zack kerr from oswaldtwistle who have be campaign for additional change place facility since zack have cerebral palsy and because of his first hand experience have be instrumental in the building of new toilet across motorway service station in england my hon friend the member for shipley anna dixon relay to that the change place toilet in bingley town centre have be life changer it be really well maintain and be clean twice day which can be important for child with complex condition who be susceptible to infection with twice daily cleaning it be also much less likely that somebody will move in there for several week continue to aspire to see national disability travel app that show accessible train station and interchange and flag up when lift be out of order and where there be change place toilet we must ensure that we do what we can to expand the provision of accessible toilet particularly change place toilet to public building park and community facility be very grateful to hon member for their contribution this afternoon encourage they to engage with their local authority and stakeholder group and impress on they the importance of change place toilet so that all our constituent can have access to clean safe and accessible facility thank you madam deputy speaker and wish you very happy summer recess be grateful to my hon friend the member for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis for secure this debate and for set such beautiful tone at the start of his speech he speak with enormous power as parent of child with cerebral palsy who require full time care and also as someone who have very long record before his time in this place of work with local parent group and national organisation such as scope and the change places campaign know that there will be people watch this debate who relate strongly to the experience he talk about and the experience that my hon friend the member for thurrock jen craft talk about by bring those people into this debate he will have give they such sense of peace he do so with such power and pay tribute to he for that his message which double underline be that campaign work and wish to show that as government we be bring that spirit to bear as well because this be such an important issue be proud to have be long stand supporter of the change place toilet campaign long before my time in this parliament have never officially be the toilet minister but have speak it into existence by tell anyone who will listen what think it be simple truth that access to toilet change place in this case and standard public facility be about dignity independence inclusion and ensure that everyone regardless of their need can fully participate in their community no one as my hon friend the member for thurrock say should ever get the message explicitly or implicitly that they be not welcome in their own community we know that for many people especially those with complex need or health condition the lack of appropriate toilet provision can be the decide factor in whether they leave the house visit the town centre or spend time with friend and family in their community without suitable facility what should be normal day out can become source of stress exclusion and even risk and we do not want that for anybody in our community that be the spirit not only of my hon friend speech but of all the contribution from our colleague the ministry of housing communities and local government have do remarkable work through the million change place toilet programme have in the past recognise the work of the previous prime minister in this space and would like to do so again these facility provide the equipment the space and the security need by more than people across the uk people for whom standard accessible toilet be simply not suitable for their need the fund have support the installation of new facility across local authority area and have be jump off point for good practice guidance mandatory technical design training to local authority and operational training hear what my hon friend the member for thurrock say about where that have fall short we note that and we will make sure that we be communicate as well we can to make sure that where these value facility have be instal they be accessible because the people who work in those space can help in the appropriate way my hon friend the member for bexleyheath and crayford be right that investment have be target to address gap where provision be limited or non existent particularly in rural town and coastal community it be important to recognise the vital role that transport play in support independence and inclusion so it must overlap with this agenda again acknowledge the important work of the department for transport which have make available more than million of funding to install change place toilet at motorway service area and railway station across the country my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee recognise the well love keele service but know that there be many other across the country change places facility make it easy for disabled people and their family to travel however and wherever they want and to be confident that their need will be meet we have hear bit about how the facility be make available and think that tool be really important the government inclusive transport strategy commit we to improve accessibility and ensure equal access to the transport network for disabled people by my hon friend the member for bexleyheath and crayford have make very important suggestion about how that could be improve with single integrated app would be keen to meet he to talk far about that and assure he that the same go for my colleague in the department for transport the minister be talk about the importance of single integrated app that would bring together accessible toilet facility and transport do he agree that we need this across the whole of the uk so that my constituent in fife and constituent in scotland can travel across the uk we be after all one country and we need these facility to be integrate and open to all our constituent will he join in congratulate my hon friend the member for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis on his amazing campaigning on issue like this on the second question absolutely will my hon friend contribution to this debate be outstanding as be his wide work on the first point as we begin summer recess great number of colleague will be cross national border within the uk in my case to west wales but other will be go to scotland it be important that people know where facility be and that we have integration be always keen to work with my counterpart in the devolved government and certainly would be keen to work with they on this issue my hon friend the members for congleton sarah russell for carlisle ms minns and for south derbyshire samantha niblett and all of we to some degree have talk about lack of provision in our community notwithstanding that there be now change place toilet hope to give degree of succour give the very important change that be make by the previous government which want to recognise the important change in building regulation in january mean that new large public building from shopping centre and art venue to motorway service and sport stadium have to have these toilet in they can give confidence to colleague that as development take place they will naturally get these facility that be really good news and very important sign it show that although thing such as building regulation might sound esoteric if do thoughtfully and to reflect the live experience of our community they can significantly improve quality of life for people across the country that change will be come that be fantastic but could the minister please think about how we can address this issue for those of we with predominantly rural community that have small town that be unlikely to have very large building will take up that point in the same spirit the intent of the original programme be to try to fill in the gap but clearly from my hon friend contribution there be more to do so will reflect on that and talk with colleague these change do not happen by accident so want to recognise the tireless campaigning of individual charity such as muscular dystrophy uk and local authority which have be progressive in this space would like to personally thank very good friend of mine in nottingham martin jackaman who be at the very heart of this campaign at the beginning it be he who introduce to the importance of this issue be when be young portfolio holder on my council nearly year ago the action of such individual have mean that progress have be make and that we can be confident of more progress to come do my hon friend agree that there be quite large amount of ignorance among people who do not need to use these facility and that it be incumbent on all of we in this house our councillor colleague and other to raise awareness so that people do not just walk on by in town not realise the need of other it be so important that in our naturally busy life we all do not cut corner whether by parking in place or use toilet that be not design for we we must understand that when we do so what may seem pretty harmless suspect it be thoughtless act could have profound impact on an individual who need those space that affect not only their day but whether in future they will be willing to venture into that amenity do not think anybody would want to have that impact we must all reflect on the impact we have and therefore on how we might mitigate they in the future and stop these thing from happen this have be an important debate as we can see from the number of colleague in the chamber we could have do with much long there be certainly much more would like to have say on public toilet but know that we will have such opportunity in the future the progress that have be make so far be result of really heroic individual campaigner and charity and have happen because people have share what be often some of the bad experience of their and their family live we be well for their willingness to do so want they to hear say from the dispatch box that yes we want they to keep campaign and fighting that be what we will all do and that in we they have government who understand the issue they be talk about and want to be their partner in improve they question put and agree to house adjourn
