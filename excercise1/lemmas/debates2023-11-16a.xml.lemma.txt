privilege of be church of england parish the payment by parish to diocese often know as common fund or parish share be voluntary payment towards the cost of ministry in those parish and in the wide

be sit thank the leader of the house for give we the business thank all those who ensure that armistice day and remembrance sunday constituency event pass off safely want to ask the leader of the house about two issue first before the ink be even dry on the king speech the prime minister have announce emergency legislation you could not make it up the supreme court ruling against the government be as damn as it be clear it conclude that deep and institutional issue in rwanda make it not safe country that should not have come as surprise to the government because they have be warn for month the prime minister bet the house that he would win and he lose before his new legislative programme have even get under way we have more desperate wheeze to salvage his sinking plan new treaty which could take week of parliamentary time to ratify and new law which former supreme court judge brand discreditable why do the home secretary not say anything about that to parliament yesterday it be yet another announcement to the medium and not to this place will the leader of the house tell we more about how this be all go to work what legal effect will this emergency legislation have when will we see it how much parliamentary time do she think this be all go to take what will be drop from the government recently announce bills to make way for this if the government be so confident that this be what it will take why do they not do it month ago instead of sit around wait for this judgment as though parliament have not spend week and week consider these issue and legislate to deal with they the government could have amend the illegal migration act instead could they not or be the former home secretary right when she say that the government fail to prepare any credible plan be the new home secretary right when he say yesterday that he do not see case for come out of international agreement or do the leader of the house agree with the prime minister that we could do so these be desperation tactic to try to make the government look as though they be do something when the truth be that this be failed unworkable and costly plan that leave their pledge to stop the boat strand secondly the prime minister seemingly could not find suitable candidate to be foreign secretary from among his own mps and instead appoint david cameron to the house of lords at time of war in europe horrify conflict in israel and gaza and threat from china iran and elsewhere elect members here be now unable to hold the foreign secretary to account agree entirely with you mr speaker that this house must be able to scrutinise his work effectively because let we be honest there be lot to hold he accountable for his link with china which the intelligence and security committee say may have be engineer by the chinese state his policy towards china famously drink pint with president xi and hail golden era and his involvement with greensill capital which be describe by the treasury committee as significant lack of judgment but none the less make he personally million of pound rich the government proposal that the minister for development and africa the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell will stand in be entirely insufficient the last time the house be in this situation conservative members be furious and demand that question must be answer in this place the then labour government be set to bring in the recommendation of the procedure committee at the time do the leader of the house agree that we should immediately dust off that report and bring forward motion to put its recommendation in place quickly they include regular accountability session for the foreign secretary in westminster hall as starter will she do that before we be next due to hear from the foreign secretary finally can the leader of the house confirm whether the appointment of david cameron have be approve by the independent adviser on ministerial interest if not when will that be do or be this another case of make the wrong call such as when the prime minister appoint his first deputy prime minister his first home secretary and his first minister without portfolio all of whom face serious allegation that later lead to their departure this be another poor judgment from weak prime minister drift to defeat agree with the comment that the hon lady make about armistice day and remembrance weekend thank all member who take part in event around the country and overseas to commemorate and thank our servicemen and woman and to remember the fallen particularly thank the police who have an incredibly difficult job on their hand in london at the weekend it be gift that every one of we in this place can raise issue in debate via amendment and other device as member and as leader of the house will always defend that right but it do not absolve we from think through the consequence of one course of action over another the debate last night show the house include its two main party and the bulk of members unite in its support for israel duty to protect her people an end to suffer for all civilian and long term peaceful solution since the vote last night know some member have come under increase stress no matter which way people vote it will have be consider decision no matter whether people agree with they or not it be their duty to exercise their own judgment today all member should think about what they can do to defuse such threat make against our colleague in this place thank mr speaker for his care in ensure we can go about our business and do our duty thank the family of those hold hostage by hamas for their time come into parliament this week to talk to parliamentarian know speak for all here when say that we will do all in our power to bring they home turn to the question raise by the shadow leader of the house her first point be about rwanda she will expect to say that further business will be announce in the usual way but as she will have hear from the prime minister we want to introduce this legislation swiftly it be part of plan of action that he have set out and that have be work on by the home office and other departments together with the large ever small boat deal with france new agreement with albania which have already return nearly people in the last month and cut albanian small boat arrival by more than an almost increase in the number of illegal work raid triple in the number of asylum decision since the start of the year plan to close the first asylum hotel and the legislation that we have bring forward there be many point of difference but one key difference be that we believe there must be deterrent element to our response the hon lady party vote time against the legislation that we have bring forward and opposition members also support block the deportation of foreign criminal the people of this country want our border to be protect and control they want to ensure that we be free and able to help those we wish to and have the great obligation to under the last labour government the mode of illegal travel here be largely haulage we end that brexit have also give we many more option to shape who come here legally we must end the scourge of these appalling people trafficker my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel and my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham suella braverman assist by my hon friend the member for corby tom pursglove my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick and other have help we thus far and thank they for all the work that they have be do it have be difficult work there be more to do but we be step close to the deterrent that we seek urge the shadow leader of the house to support we in our effort we will introduce legislation it be quite normal as she know to do that even if it be not include in the king speech there be many potential situation for that to arise on number of issue face parliament in this session the hon lady raise the issue of the new foreign secretary person who have do tremendous amount on the last topic that she raise combat illegal migration through his work with professor paul collier and the work that he have do on conflict state he be ahead of the curve on that issue and think that he will make an excellent foreign secretary she be right that the house must be able to hold he to account this be not an unusual situation it have happen before with the noble lords mandelson adonis frost morgan and think other the hon lady should be reassure that mr speaker have take advice on the matter my understanding be that the procedure committee will be consult on the good way forward she allude to some of the option that may be require of the new foreign secretary who know will want to be accountable to this house there be very important matter in front of we next year will be an unprecedented year for election across the world with significant consequence for this nation and an increase set of complex issue that know all hon member will want to question the foreign secretary on she have my assurance in that respect further business will be announce in the usual way call the father of the house the house and my right hon friend will know of my personal and political interest in residential leasehold reform when might the leasehold and freehold reform bill come to the house and will she join in give more publicity to the consultation modern leasehold restrict rent on exist lease which start week ago and will last for another five week the ground rent issue affect up to million household most people do not know that the government be consider five alternative for restrict it will she help to publicise that and say when the bill might be introduce so that the house can consider the issue my hon friend who be very experienced have already provide solution to one part of his question by get that on the record and advertise it to all hon member will certainly ensure that the secretary of state have hear of his particular interest he will not be surprised to hear say that further business will be announce in the usual way but shall endeavour to ensure that he be keep inform by the department of progress on the bill call the snp spokesperson people in scotland learn something this week however much we dislike and distrust this tory government it be nothing compare with how much they utterly loathe each other those letter email and whatsapp message show that they spend their time attack each other leave no time to help people struggle with the tory mortgage and rent bombshell or with rocket energy bill and no time to reduce nhs waiting list in england now approach million or to cap food inflation which be still run at over they be way too busy fight like rat in sack even their squalid unlawful rwanda scheme have fall apart however bring good news to the leader of the house to cheer she up news from part of the uk where government be get on with the job where not single day have be lose in the nhs to industrial dispute where teacher be the well pay in the uk where the scottish child payment be take ten of thousand out of poverty where the railway have be take into public ownership where there be free school meal for all pupil to where there be more gps per head than anywhere in the uk where those age and over get free bus travel along with our year old and where we offer free university tuition free prescription free eye test and free personal care to our old folk that be in scotland under the snp lead scottish government as the leader of the house know but her government have cunning plan to make everything come good new minister for common sense wokefinder general to search out wake thinking and eliminate it the job be in the safe hand of someone who be allow to attend cabinet but be prohibit from speak in meeting and anyone who know the new minister know that period of silence may be her first and overwhelming challenge for some light relief in this very bleak week for her government could the leader of the house help many of her baffled colleague and try to give we her definition of wake be sure that you mr speaker would take dim view of it if refuse to answer the hon lady question if just stand here in silence because do not fancy do it or object strongly to the content and tone of the question have do that you might ask why show up this morning if be not prepared to do my duty in this house and to show respect to the house it would be bit like attend at the cenotaph and not sing the national anthem the hon lady display distinct lack of self awareness grow tired of read out to she each week statistic on the performance of her own government but since she invite to again let give she two statistic that address the issue she raise in england the nhs month waiting list be down by since september and doctor or headteacher in scotland pay approximately more in tax will continue to do my duty to this house and to remind the snp of their appalling record in government which be obvious to everyone except they finally on all sort of issue that many would perhaps describe as woke this government have proud record because we recognise that compassion and care for everyone in our society be very important that be why we do the large ever lgbt action plan from which we want practical measure that would make difference to people life conservatism to have always be about the practical impact that we have on people life and step up and take responsibility not just for ourselves but for other people give her background and life experience think that my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey who will now sit at the cabinet

that his committee have already look at be very sorry to hear about the disruption to the hon gentleman constituent ability to travel he will know that that be concern to this government it be one reason why we have bring forward legislation to guarantee minimum service level in area such as transport and emergency service it be incredibly important that industrial action particularly when it take place over long period of time do not disrupt people life and cause they for example to lose their job as have be happen in other part of the country urge he to reflect on whether he could support those measure particularly for specific sector that we will bring forward in this session about year ago have an unlikely campaigning role that involve organise counter demonstration to certain mass march but one area we never have to worry about be the vicinity of parliament because no demonstration be allow in parliament square the reason give for that be that member must not be impede in enter or leave the houses of parliament even if demonstration continue to be allow in parliament square it should be common concern to those on both side of the house that member find themselves get advice from their whip on which exit they can not use for fear of be mob by an unauthorised demonstration that come right up to the gate of parliament this really have go too far soon

speech the government say that be because this be very complicated it be not complicated load of country have measure on this and have have for year be the real reason as have be tell that the minister for women and equalities herself be block this much need reform the right hon gentleman will know that bring an end to these practice be manifesto commitment it remain manifesto commitment he will also know that this be complex situation lot of work have already be do particularly by faith group to enable idea and solution to be bring forward thank all member who have engage on this particularly with the minister who lead on the issue to try to make progress the secretary of state be still look at the policy on this and she be very aware that the house will want her decision

the government they have identify zone around the country that need improvement and ensure that local authority can put measure in place to address these matter this be an area where we can benefit from share good practice across the country it be important that we do these thing while still enable economic growth to flourish as we know we can be sure that if she be to apply for debate on the subject it would be well attend can we have debate on the failure of the metropolitan police to investigate an openly terrorist support socialist workers party pamphlet which have be report on in several newspaper entitle palestine resistance revolution and the struggle for hamas it have be on sale during the protest march every weekend in london and it include the line we unconditionally

friend agree that the police should act under section of the terrorism act thank my right hon and learn friend for raise this important matter it be extremely disturbing to hear that he will know that the police chief have our total backing in use the full extent of the law to crack down on any criminality and what he describe sound like it fall into that category the police have power to arrest those who belong to or glorify terrorist group such as hamas under the terrorism act and anyone who incite racial hatred under the public order act and we support they in use those power be afraid that the socialist workers be rentagob who show up to all kind of protest spout all kind of hate and deserve close look as the leader of the house may be aware be co chair of the all party parliamentary group for access to medical cannabis under prescription currently young teagan appleby who be constituent of the hon member for dover mrs elphicke be in hospital in london and very poorly the former minister make every effort in his role to break down the barrier for medicinal cannabis under prescription to child with epilepsy will the leader of the house please urge the new

and woman who have good work knowledge of contemporary politic and prove track record of experience who above all know their own mind with those word in mind might the leader of the house be able to facilitate debate so that we can all learn how party across the house can attract such candidate to be elect to this place be sure speak for all member present when say how sorry we be at that sad news and that our thought be with sir thomas friend and family he achieve the only conservative gain in the election which be the second time he stand for parliament he be parliamentary private secretary in the northern ireland office and later in the foreign and commonwealth office he be vice chairman of the party under peter brooke in and be tell that the most enjoyable time he spend in parliament be when he head the commons treasury select committee which include an investigation into the downfall of barings bank he achieve great deal for this country and we remember he and his service fondly hon member hear hear on october in point of order name zaher birawi and muhammad qassem sawalha as hamas operative live in london since then further hamas operative such as majed khalil

what the home office be do about hamas operative here in britain thank the hon gentleman for raise this matter which know be concern for many member across the house we have give the police new and update power and we will continue to look at what further support they can be give to tackle this appalling situation there can be absolutely no tolerance for anyone who facilitate or support terrorism that be very clear and think that view be share on all side of this house even if some member sometimes find it hard to articulate it as the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi have say teagan appleby my teenage constituent be at the moment in intensive care across the road in the evelina london children hospital my right hon friend will know from my question and her answer in june that it be an urgent matter for teagan to have support from the government to have fund for and access to her medicinal cannabis which she need to manage her epilepsy that meeting my right hon friend be kind in her support for it and her follow up with the department of health have still not happen can ask my right hon friend to pass another message to the health secretary to say not that we need another the meeting on this issue but that we need action and that we need the funding to be available to every single child who need access to this medicine now there need to be in the autumn statement special fund set aside to allow these child to have access to the medicine they need teagan mother emma could not do any more and she be heartbroken when she send message overnight at midnight that teagan be now intubated and that she have to be keep in that medical state to manage day of constant seizure be extremely sorry to hear what my hon friend have say do appreciate that member across this house will have have experience in which we be very invest in the wellbeing of our constituent and know this will be very difficult time not just for teagan and her family but for my hon friend and other who have campaign on this issue be very disappointed to hear that the department of health have not meet my hon friend wish to make it clear and do make it clear to departments that my request for meeting between official or ministers and members of this house be not optional this house can call people to meet it in select committees and government departments be fund to provide service to this house and be really very disappointed that the department of health have not do that know that immediately after this session even though will be in the chamber my official will contact the department of health and through my parliamentary private secretary will contact the secretary of state for health to make she aware of this situation we appreciate that we can not make clinical decision on behalf of individual patient but what we can ensure be that if drug or medical device could benefit patient the system be in place to ensure that they get access to it even if it be not for nice approve treatment people in this country still have that right we will facilitate an immediate meeting with the department of health and will be keep inform of progress on this matter scotland be energy rich in the last two month alone scotland export million mwh of electricity through the grid to england yet along with the people of north wales scots pay the high electricity cost in the uk londoner pay year in stand charge before switch or gas hob be turn on but in the part of the uk where lighting and heating be turn on far early and turn off far later these standing charge be over one third higher at year do the leader of the house really think that be fair and if not will she facilitate debate on these unjust standing charge thank the hon gentleman for raise this point think standing charge should get scrutiny from this house know that many hon and right hon member will have concern in all part of the uk about fairness and how some charge be be apply will make sure that the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have hear what the hon gentleman have say be sure that if he be to apply for debate it would be well attend as we see in yesterday king speech debate some view on the gaza conflict be become dangerously oversimplified and binary someone be either in favour of ceasefire or they be in favour of the war continue that be not just misleading it be also provocative will the government utilise statement or hold debate to confirm britain position on support humanitarian pause position that be adopt by united nations security council resolution last night thank my right hon friend for raise that issue he have great experience in this area he be right and think the view be express well last night that in call for ceasefire what people have be ask be for israel to deviate from its duty to protect its citizen and defend itself if israel put down its arm it cease to exist that be the situation now and only the end of hamas or whatever might try to take their place and long term solution that guarantee peace will enable it to do that that be very important we have proud track record of protect international humanitarian law and protect citizen we monitor closely what go on not just with this situation but with other include the attention to detail and care that israel be take in ensure that it be the right side of that line my right hon friend will know that on recent operation the israeli defence forces will have have humanitarian and medical professional embed in its force to ensure that that happen repeat what say at the start of this question whatever hon member decide to do in this place base on their conscience they should be allow to do it we can all take care of each other in this place when hon member inevitably and sadly come under threat for do so november mark islamophobia awareness month which be time for everyone commit to equality and anti racism to reiterate their position on islamophobia and their dedication to stamp out that hate it have now be five year since the all party group on british muslims publish its definition of islamophobia which be back by community group academic political party trade union and many council it be four year since the government commit to develop an official definition and one year since they decide that tackle hatred against muslims be not important and abandon that plan give that islamophobia be up by since october will the leader of the house urge the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities to come to the house and give statement on his work on tackle islamophobia thank the hon gentleman for raise that important point will certainly write to the secretary of state and to other secretaries of state who will have an interest to ensure that they have hear what he say recently visit birmingham to show support to the jewish community there in the wake of some of the attack that they be have to endure be strike by the fact that the local muslim community have come over to the hebrew centre to show support to condemn hamas and to stand with the jewish community in the wake of those attack when inquire why they have do that they tell that as well as be the right thing to do in the wake of when the muslim community have come under attack and be associate wrongly with those terrorist atrocity the jewish community come and stand between they and an angry mob to protect they what be often lose in the recent scene we have see be the decade of quiet work between different faith community who all believe in the same god may ask for debate in government time on the scrutiny of financial service regulation since we leave the european union that have be undertake by sub committee of the treasury committee we have appoint expert adviser we regularly take evidence on new consultation from the regulator and we have publish report to keep the house inform about that

this be vital to ensure that we see the economic growth we want in all part of the uk thank the leader of the house for answer business question mps staff employment conditions beg to move that this house welcome the second report of the speaker conference on the employment condition of members staff hc of session endorse its recommendation recognise member responsibility as employer and the need to improve the work life of members staff and accordingly call on the house of commons commission ipsa and the political party to address and implement the recommendation from the speaker conference move this motion on behalf of my hon friend the member for broxbourne sir charles walker he be at the funeral of andrew lee who be long time conservative party agent and activist he be hold in very high regard and have be an agent for many member of this house he be one of those character we all know in our respective party he be the life and soul of our party and our democracy be build on the shoulder of such people they often do not get any focus or plaudit but they do huge amount to facilitate democracy in this country my hon friend send his apology for not be here in person the second report of the speaker conference make series of recommendation design to improve the work life of members staff and provide well support to member as employer the staff who work for we as individual member of parliament play huge and valuable role not only in support our work here in westminster but in work tirelessly for our constituent often in very stressful situation the employment arrangement of members staff be not matter for the government but welcome the conclusion that member of this house should continue to employ their own staff directly it be for each member to determine how good to carry out their role and the current employment model provide an important element of flexibility to member to arrange their staff in the way that good suit each individual member be supportive of what the leader of the house be bring forward but must ask the follow question many mp do not have the training as employer to answer many question and the staff development she be refer to be not natural to those of we who be not from that background do she agree that great support to allow we to aid our staff development be imperative that will allow staff to feel that there be route to take to great advancement do she agree that funding for that should be provide centrally so that staff do not feel they be be scrutinise by the public for take beneficial yet costly development course thank the hon gentleman for raise that important point he will know that the report make reference to ensure that proper support training and service be provide to enable individual member to be the good employer they can be my hon friend the member for broxbourne whose name be also on this motion and who would be move it be he here have also do huge amount of work to ensure that member in future will be able to undertake training and get qualification which be tremendously important it will help they in their work here and enable they to continue their career when they leave this place it be good use of budget to enable we to be the good member of parliament that we can be also welcome the recommendation on provide further help and support to member and their staff in relation to employment matter we need to ensure that all who work in parliament be treat properly and fairly and the package of measure announce in this report will deliver significant improvement particularly welcome the recommendation on improve mental health support for member and their staff and know that colleague in all part of the house will do the same the report also make series of recommendation about the role of the independent parliamentary standards authority ipsa be rightly independent from both the government and parliament but note the constructive engagement that have take place between the speaker conference and ipsa and the formal response publish by ipsa early this week which set out how it aim to address some of the challenge identify by the conference that fall within its area of responsibility be pleased to see progress on entitlement to sickness and parental leave for staff who move between member and look forward to see proposal on great support for member and staff in relation to constituency office in due course think the recommendation on continuity of service be important have see the injustice in that area in respect of one of my member of staff will the leader of the house advise on whether those measure will apply retrospectively to exist staff be propose this on behalf of my hon friend the member for broxbourne but shall certainly make sure that can get the precise detail to the hon gentleman much would depend on what be in an individual contract as those will vary substantially depend on how they have work here will endeavour to get an answer to he on that finally would like to endorse the report conclusion about the valuable work of the members service team it provide expert advice and support to colleague on range of matter but in particular it be vital source of support on employment issue the report rightly recognise the value of that support and highlight the importance of colleague engage with the team on any staffing issue that arise encourage any colleague with concern about an employment issue to contact the team at the early opportunity and welcome the report recommendation to create system of account manager to provide more direct support to member in this area particularly wish to thank chris sear the director of the members service team who be retire at the end of this month after long career in the house the work that chris have do to expand the service that provide assistance to member of this house have be hugely welcome he be instrumental and very helpful in conduct the large member survey ever do which take place this year and be about what kind of service and support people need want to place on record the gratitude that colleague have for he and his team hope these measure carry the support of members and commend the motion to the house call the shadow deputy leader of the house this be an important debate about the culture and working condition in parliament as member of this house and as employer of staff we should ensure that all staff feel value and respected regardless of whether they be employ by member directly or by the house authority in the palace or in our constituency office staff work across parliament and the country be the backbone of our democracy and give my personal thank for their dedication be sure that sentiment be echo across all benches the issue of pay recognition and ensure safe and respectful workplace be not new they be long stand issue on which we should always work hard but it be important to recognise how much progress have be make thank be due in no small part to the work of the parliamentary trade union and the house authority we support the recommendation outline in the speaker conference report which be welcome step in the right direction crucially there will be change for member staff concern continuity of service that will mean improve maternity and paternity right enhance right regard sick pay and well redundancy arrangement also it be right that our hr function support and advice be available to our staff as well as to member that will enable staff to make informed choice about their employment on balance the report conclude that mp staff should remain under the direct employment of members complement by the new hr service it will also be good to reclassify staff training and cost to support the wide participation in career development together these be good step in the right direction and should help improve the working culture of our house the report primary purpose be not to focus on the conduct of member and possible way of redress but that issue be partially cover welcome the role of the independent complaints and grievance scheme in deal with incident of poor behaviour by member the process appear to be improve and timescale to complete case be say to be come down but will the leader of the house address the follow question will recommendation concern hr and continuity of service be finalise by the general election be there plan to look far at the role of the icgs and its process be future assessment point plan to monitor progress of the report as have set out we welcome the recommendation of the report and thank the speaker and the member of the speaker conference for their diligence work together we need to stick with this important task finally if approve by members today hope the report recommendation will be implement as soon as possible have not plan to speak in the debate but as member of the speaker conference think at the last minute it be important to come to the house to recognise the work of everyone involve in put together the report as the leader of the house of commons my right hon friend the member for portsmouth north penny mordaunt acknowledge we rely on many of the speaker staff and other staff in the house of commons to put the report together the report be an important piece of work which welcome and hope will be approve today while we be make progress it be important that we continue to look at our organisation and way in which we can improve the relationship between staff and employer be at the heart of what this place be about in deliver democracy and legislate for the benefit of the country to change culture take time and to implement that change take time but think that this be an important and fundamental step forward there have be progress but there be always more to do let we continue to do it this be the second report put on the record as member of the conference my thank to the members service team and to chris sear who be stalwart in support we like many other be sure wish he well in his retirement call the snp spokesperson the snp of course welcome any proposal that aim to ensure good employment practice and in this case to ensure that staff be part of an inclusive respectful and fair work environment pay tribute to the work of the speaker conference and commend its recommendation the high profile incident that in part spark the report lay bare aspect of an inappropriate and unacceptable workplace culture that have run through this place so with renew urgency the report undertake to ensure that current working practice and condition of staff be fit for purpose and that everyone who work in the parliamentary community feel support and have uninhibite access to that support the contribution of mps staff to this place be enormous we all know that and all too often it go unseen as part of its inquiry into culture the report speak of collective failure of the house to recognise and reward hard work staff constituency staff in particular be single out as feel neglect and detach from westminster go without much of the support and additional service make available to those work on the estate that be unacceptable and must and hope will change we welcome the report recommendation to champion the work of mps staff that is the work of those who enable everyone here to do their job we wholeheartedly support the aim of the report to ensure parity of employment condition and more rewarding work culture across the wide parliamentary community we be also very much in favour of the propose expansion of the members services team which over such short time have already come to provide an invaluable and highly professional service have have to call on their help in the past know just how highly professional helpful and sensitive to the issue they be the recommendation of that team evolution to members and members staff service be commendable as small employer mps should of course have access to well human resource support but staff should also have access to guidance and advice independent of their employ mp the report describe members staff as uniquely vulnerable and the current members services team be find to be under resource the report plan to incorporate new restorative practice for workplace dispute resolution be welcome recommendation that would help to create uniform procedure for mps staff across this house inadequate provision of employee support employer guidance and qualified hr expert directly impact the experience of staff so we be very supportive of the report recommendation to improve that and to improve on the great work of the current team since the members expense scandal that lead to its creation the independent parliamentary standards authority have rightfully provide the public with much great accountability and transparency on mps spending however the report highlight some key challenge arise from ipsa dual responsibility as service regulator and service provider we support the report recommendation for ipsa to make change to the scheme of business cost and expense particularly on continuity of employment should staff move between member office statutory entitlement such as family leave and redundancy accrue while in the employ of one member should not evaporate due to change of member it be important that we recognise the previous service of staff and ensure the continuance of their employment condition simply put staff should not be treat as cost move between account note that the report also recommend that the role of staff should be classify as essential support work not merely include on the expense tab of member that alone would go long way to shift the perception of members staff and the hard work that they do support both constituent and their employ mp we also support the report recommendation for work group to be set up in collaboration with ipsa to review the provision of accommodation and to improve the work environment of staff member the speaker conference proposal be welcome set of recommendation that will undeniably improve the culture and working condition of staff across constituency office research team house and members employee we must ensure that this somewhat atypical structure have typical employment condition that be both predictable and fair certainly hope that member across the house will support these recommendation have be member of the conference be delighted to be able to speak in this debate the conference have do some important work we all know that this be highly individual workplace and that bring pressure close and intense working and daily range of issue that be varied and challenging we all know of personnel case where thing have go wrong so it be very good idea to create the speaker conference and all its member set off on our work know there be problem to solve that the work condition of our team members staff could and must be improve we have have very good process and thank the house staff for all that they do in particular thank they for their research and for draw interesting parallel between other parliaments around the world it be clear that some of these parliaments have be on similar journey to ourselves it be hard enough to organise thing on national parliamentary basis but to do so on an international parliamentary basis be particularly challenging think back to joint meeting with representative from the bundestag the organisation be good we have to fit in with multiple participant co ordinate between sitting and ensure good translation service know more about that meeting because chair it but there be many other meeting as well the way in which house officers carry out their background research be particularly helpful for example there be visit to my constituency office among number of other such visit to see what happen in the more distant part of the parliamentary estate we have visit from the director of members services mr chris sear when he join we in harrogate make myself scarce by visit some constituent so he could talk to the team and find out what they be do and all that they do to support people on daily basis throughout this process be aware that there have be some difficulty with gather information there be plenty of anecdotal information but problem have be hard to quantify that difficulty with information mean that to keep perspective and proportionality in all that we do we have to constantly remind those involve that the vast majority of mp be good employer there be focus on three area culture community and behaviour will comment if may on couple of the more important decision the first be to keep mps as employer of their team and as the decider of who be in their team that be very good thing any change to that would have be difficult to implement and would be sure have meet significant resistance it also become clear very quickly that the way that support be provide or access by member staff be slightly haphazard and that that could be improve member staff can sometimes feel like second class citizen for example when everyone else on the parliamentary estate be eligible for flu jab they be not list members staff as expense be demean they be not expense they do valuable work member staff could join parliamentary network the transfer of employment right for staff when they change from work for one mp to another be critical effectively member of staff have to start all over again when member retire or lose their seat or when constituency boundary be abolish that member of staff may have work here for many year but they would not have any employment right clearly that be wrong as result of the conference that will change and that transfer of right be very early decision further point be the member services team with recommendation for significantly great hr support basically this be about move everything to far more professional and standard working arrangement one area where more be to be do concern those who be work away from the estate it be hard to see what be go on in constituency office there be or so in diverse location around our nation and be sure that further work be need the parliamentary authority should work together alongside the political party to identify early where risk may be develop for example staff turnover rate could be consider or basic personnel admin such as leave record during the conference work we spend some time discuss the structure of mps office possibly because spend large amount of time ensure that we do so some be well than other but how colleague set up their office be their business not mine my hon friend make valuable point both he and be pretty experienced in the private sector in manage people not everyone have that experience but believe that the hr service available to member be excellent will he consider in future conference make it requirement that member undertake an hr exercise before they be allow to recruit staff who will be pay for by the taxpayer my right hon friend make an extremely interesting point the challenge be that when member start here the work start immediately and the period between an election and the workload start be very brief what she suggest could be practically difficult but she be quite correct about possible lack of experience and how standard practice although they may be difficult to deliver be clearly the right thing to do my right hon friend make very valuable point which should be consider because do not think that this be the end of the process member structure their officer differently all my team have always be base in harrogate and knaresborough have never have team member base in westminster london mp have different need probably base their team on the parliamentary estate most member will split their team result of our work will be the creation of series of template to show new member what success might look like not to impose but to guide and the provision of more training when they arrive and be set up their office the absence of imposition be important because we be all individual with different need and different background so the political party have role to play in the training of new mp some of whom as my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey say may have very limited experience or even none of be an employer it be true that this be an individual workplace but that have sometimes be use as an excuse for not look hard enough at what happen here or as get out of jail card for poor practice that be not acceptable we have set of recommendation we work to make sure that they be practical and there be many of they it be great call by mr speaker to create the conference again thank the house team for all their work to support we they do very good job can confirm to colleague that throughout the conference work be do in constructive collegiate cross party way our task now be to implement the finding of the conference but do not think that this work while positive should be the only part of an initiative to improve standard in our public life and politic since become member of parliament eight current or former labour mps have be give custodial sentence two conservative one liberal democrat and one scottish nationalist we have have by election cause by poor behaviour by colleague from all part of the house and there have be case of bad practice series of process have be introduce in good faith to address problem but think it have become apparent that the house need to do more work to both simplify and speed up the process who be responsible for what what happen when people be be investigate and how do that work align with the recall of mps act it be also for the political party to recognise problem and act though it be easy to say the other lot be corrupt we hear that all the time my point be that the problem be wide and deep that be broad issue than the speaker conference deal with think our work in this conference will improve sizeable part of our political system it should be support and implement as soon as possible it be pleasure to follow the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough andrew jones too take part in the speaker conference and echo his thank to the speaker for set up the conference because as we get into our work it become apparent to we that there be great deal that need look into think we go wider than the initial envisage scope for the conference in many of the thing we deal with it be an important step forward particularly for our staff and the independence of the process that staff can initiate the process if they feel that they be not be treat in the way they have every right to expect to be by their employer when we set off there be quite strong feeling that we should be employ staff centrally either under ipsa or some other body set up by the house however that idea be quickly dispense with as it become apparent that because of the diversity in the way mps approach do their job they have to remain the employer and the people who select those who work in their office there be very personal relationship and there must be great deal of trust between mps and the staff in their office it be particularly close relationship at time deal with sensitive and political issue it be impossible to have an arrangement whereby staff be not directly employ by and responsible to that member of parliament however that place great deal of responsibility on we regard how we go about do our job and ensure that we be good employer there be good recommendation in this report in relation to that think there will be work group on mps office it be an area where one size do not fit all and mp must be allow flexibility in how they set up office in their constituency and whether they do so at all as have be say some mps may just have their staff in westminster while other may be hybrid with both constituency office and people here that be where be at the moment although until covid all my staff have be place in my constituency welcome the recommendation for further work relate to office it will not surprise anyone who be on the conference that the main thing want to speak about be the dreaded ipsa it be far from my view that the public money spend on run my office should not be in the public domain stand by the fact that transparency be important in that regard and that should be accountable for what do with taxpayer money to represent my constituency have no problem with that whatsoever however ipsa be set up in haste and be we start again today it would not be create there be no question about that it can not perform the dual role of regulator and service provider and it have not do so very well welcome the recommendation from the conference that ipsa at least take good look at itself and try to separate those role within its organisation we need to scrutinise that very closely because do not think ipsa be capable of fulfil both the customer service and regulatory role we go to the scottish parliament and look at the way it arrange its scrutiny of finance and provision of support to member of the scottish parliament have to say that the scottish approach impress no end the people there understand that they be there to assist the msps in their role but none the less there be set of rule that msps have to adhere to we need to move to system similar to that urge the speaker or the leader of the house to continue to scrutinise what ipsa do in response to this report particularly in separate its customer service and regulatory role because that be crucial to improve the way it deal with member of parliament will just give one example the dreaded ipsa web portal when we ask question about it ipsa staff admit that they have never even think about the fact that mps would need to use it when they set it up you could make it up it be like question and answer session from the thick of it it be unbelievable that ipsa could have set up system that be design for mp to use and not consider how we might access and use it the web portal be design for access by accountant rather than member of parliament ipsa accept that it be not an easily usable or accessible system but it have do very little to improve it and it do require improvement that it have take so long to happen underline the fact that ipsa have for far too long be run take it or leave it service because it have the regulatory power it be time that be separate off my one request in this debate be that we continue to scrutinise that area and that recommendation to make sure that it be implement properly thank all member who have contribute to this debate and in particular all member who take part in the speaker conference and facilitate its work think we have have welcome and thoughtful debate will briefly answer four point raise be ask about the retrospective nature of some of the proposal in the report provision on continuity of service be matter for ipsa and although it be unlikely that measure would be apply retrospectively that will depend on individual circumstance if people have question ipsa be the body to go to for answer couple of hon member raise the important matter of training the speaker conference look at various carrot and stick that could be deploy to ensure that people undergo training stick such as not allow member access to publicly fund salary or insurance scheme however it decide that it be in no one interest for somebody to be unable to access such thing and that that be therefore probably not stick that could be use the house authority have give great deal of thought to the question of member undergo training when we arrive in this place we be very busy especially in the first few week if we be new member prospective parliamentary candidate be more likely to be keen to undergo training before they get here so as we approach general election the house be consider an enhance package of training on hr responsibility or security matter that member should be apprise of before they arrive here the hon member for eltham clive efford talk about ipsa and there be ongoing work there know that all interested party will continue to scrutinise the work of ipsa and encourage its improvement my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough andrew jones raise very important point about standard and the duty of care that we all have to one another not just with regard to our own behaviour but when we see behaviour from other member or from member of staff that fall short of what should be expect in this place this be particularly complicated issue for we here member of the public might scratch their head and wonder why but the fact be that we be not one organisation we be about organisation of individual office and employer we have our political party and our whip structure and we also have our responsibility under the ministerial code that be very good reason why the standards committee be look at the whole landscape of standard for my money think the answer lie in our all have clear understanding of our duty of care to one another no complicated rulebook can ever operate well without an understanding and buy in from all party about what good duty of care to one another look like finally on behalf of we all may thank all our staff for the tremendous work they do often in very stressful situation for example many office do incredible work during op pitting which know be traumatic for lot of parliamentary staff who sometimes have to make life and death decision on behalf of other thank again the speaker conference hope that all member will support the motion and commend it to the house question put and agree to beg to move that this house have consider be glad to come to the house today to discuss this important subject we discuss at recent reception host by the all party parliamentary group for climate change last month and also at recent meeting of the environmental audit committee welcome the interest of colleague from across the chamber note that the all party parliamentary group on the environment have just release its report on the subject include nine recommend priority for that too be welcome contribution to the debate the upcoming conference of the party host by the united arab emirates come at really important moment in tackle the climate crisis amid record temperature and emission the first comprehensive stocktake of progress against the paris agreement at will show that the world be badly off track we have make significant progress through the paris agreement with temperature projection shift from increase before paris to an increase of between and after glasgow thank to the nationally determined contribution that country have say they will make but we know that be not enough in glasgow we cement the goal of limit global temperature increase to no more than and make that our north star and that have be carry forward by the uae presidency the late science and the impact that we see even at show we why that be so important top priority for the uk be to leave with clear road map to keep ceiling of in reach the uk head to with record at home and internationally that be second to none the prime minister recently reaffirm our commitment to net zero and set out new approach to get there this will make it easy for business supply chain and household to adapt to the new normal we will build on our previous success and continue to lead be not sure that we be always as good as we should be at share this story of which the nation can be proud at home we have decarbonise more than any major economy on this planet cut our emission by since not only have we decarbonise fast than any major economy on the planet to date but we have the most ambitious plan and the most ambitious nationally determine contribution for of any major economy our commitment be to reduction by by comparison the eu which have be genuine force for good in this space have an ndc of by although it hop and expect to exceed that how have we do that our inheritance be not great one as recently as nearly of our electricity come from coal next year thank to the policy of this government it will be zero we inherit in an electricity system in which almost unbelievably less than of our generation come from renewable in the first quarter of this year it be nearly we have transform our renewable base we have eliminate coal be aware of no country anywhere that have do more and go far fast but lead in that way be not enough for we as country that produce less than of global emission right though it be that we should do so we also have to lead the global conversation and that be exactly what we do at when we take on the presidency of of global gdp be cover by net zero pledge when we hand on to egypt it be over and be proud to say that this country lead that conversation not only be we lead but the rest of the world be accept the need to act even if nationally determined contribution and national plan do not yet match what be need to meet the net zero challenge but be pleased to say that ours do we have ambitious target and we will deliver on they as say we have to make sure that the other of global emission start to follow the same trajectory so our offer and engagement will be all about encourage the rest of the world to join the uk on net zero pathway two year on from glasgow the need to accelerate action be more urgent than ever the world need to decarbonise more than five time fast than we do in the last two decade the country in the world that have cut its emission more than any major economy namely the uk have reduce they by in year but accord to the intergovernmental panel on climate change the scientific body that advise we on this the world need to cut its emission by by from baseline to keep net zero alive that show we the challenge we need to be peak globally by the late united nations framework convention on climate change nationally determine contribution synthesis report show that emission be set to be below the level by if all the commitment make so far be when the science say that we need reduction the late state of climate action report from the world resources institute carry similarly stark message we need to accelerate the transition rapidly only one of its indicator for the progress need by be on track we also have to be up front about the fact that we face significant challenge come into this cop geopolitical tension conflict and challenging macroeconomic context in which government be battle inflation and debt relation be strained as witness at first hand when go to the climate ministers meeting in chennai some country be seek to stoke division to deflect from their own responsibility to take action at the same time record temperature and widespread climate impact be increase the need to act on adaptation loss and damage as well as reduce emission we need broad base progress across all pillar of the paris agreement at finance will be critical part of the transition develop economy need to deliver on their promise to mobilise billion in climate finance for develop country we all know that we be due to deliver this in and collectively we fall behind in glasgow we set course correction to meet the goal by be pleased that today report from the oecd show that we be ahead of the projection we set out in glasgow we deliver billion in and the oecd have indicate that it be likely not definite but likely that the billion goal be in fact meet in delivery of that commitment be something that the uk have champion and be pleased to say that we recently make our big ever climate finance commitment through our billion contribution to the green climate fund there be also an urgent need to realign the financial system so that it be fit to address the challenge we face today include climate and development the science be unequivocally clear that urgent action be need the vital work do by the ipcc and other scientist make clear that the risk and impact we face will grow significantly as temperature increase include the risk of breach tipping point which will accelerate that negative trend at we want to see progress across five area the first of which be commitment to keep alive come out of the global stocktake we need renew consensus and increase ambition to keep within reach we also need clear forward look road map with commitment to peak global emission by global target for key sector particularly those that be hard to decarbonise and commitment to action include through initiative such as the breakthrough agenda and in other key area such as forest the phasing out of hydrofluorocarbon and clear guidance for the next round of ndcs which will be central feature of the belém cop in the amazon in two year time the second area be clear progress towards clean energy future include commitment to triple global renewable energy deployment and double energy efficiency by that sit alongside clear commitment on phase out unabated fossil fuel our position on that issue be unchanged since the commitment that the uk help to deliver early this year and to phase out coal power build on outcome the third area be reform of the international financial institution to unlock trillion for global challenge include development and climate action and delivery of our exist commitment alongside billion per year in climate finance for develop economy as have mention previously the oecd late report on figure show that develop country be on track to meet that goal the fourth area be improve adaptation to climate change deliver on our glasgow commitment to double adaptation finance by and establish an effective loss and damage fund to support country that be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effect of climate change we be pleased that the transitional committee that be set up to reach agreement on what that loss and damage fund should look like have put forward recommendation to the uk be instrumental in secure that recommendation and we hope it will be agree by all party at we will continue to advocate for the priority of the most vulnerable we hold third climate and development ministerial at the pre cop event last month in abu dhabi which co chair to do just that the fifth area be that we want real progress towards protect restore and sustainably manage nature for example by make concrete progress on the historic agreement we land to halt and reverse deforestation by action to deliver net zero be not just matter of do the right thing or of avoid harm it be crucial to our security and prosperity here in the uk both now and in the future the global net zero transition could be worth trillion to uk business between and uk business be in the vanguard of recognise the opportunity that spring from net zero over two third of ftse company and thousand of small business have pledge to reduce their emission in line with the target under the race to zero campaign over half of the signatory to that campaign be from the uk net zero be already an engine for growth and revitalisation of formerly deindustrialise area in the uk we be leader across number of area we have the world five large offshore wind farm project and the world no rank green finance centre and we be lead the way in develop an approach to carbon capture and storage to name few example action on climate and nature be also crucial for our energy security and to reduce exposure to future global shock such as those cause by russia invasion of ukraine the north sea transition to clean energy powerhouse with of offshore wind by will reduce exposure to volatile international energy market and be an engine for clean energy export action on adaptation and nature be crucial in world where food security be increasingly under threat however we need everyone with we on this journey the opportunity be huge in we will see record trillion invest in clean energy alone accord to the international energy agency electric vehicle be on track to account for two third of new car sale globally by the transition to clean energy and electric vehicle be take off and it will spread to other sector quickly at we need to show progress on deliver the historic agreement we land in glasgow we must use uk expertise to scale green finance support other to accelerate the transition in key sector of the global economy and set clear pathway to at this point be happy to hear from other member simon stiell the un climate executive secretary say at that we need everybody everywhere in the world every single day do everything they possibly can to address the climate crisis that be the scale of the challenge ahead of we and the global stocktake synthesis report have underline what be at stake we be fall short on mitigation adaptation and finance current ncd be to gigatonne of carbon dioxide equivalent short of what be need to limit warming to the conclusion be stark there be rapidly close window of opportunity to secure liveable and sustainable future for all indeed in meeting have have recently with climate scientist they have warn that although they want to cling to the hope of keep alive they fear we be now in the territory of at we lose our coral reef for example that be not solution that we should be happy to live with echo simon stiell the global stocktake report state that much more action on all front and by all actor be need now one would not know it from the speech that the minister have just make but we do not have government who be take the action on all front that be need now we have government who be not just stall but take we backwards think it be quite cheek for the minister to cite electric vehicle give that the government have just row back from the ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicle the motor manufacturing sector include the society of motor manufacturers and traders and the ford motor company be quite happy with that date the only reason that date be move be that in the wake of the uxbridge by election the prime minister want to play party politic with net zero the minister be quite audacious at time he say that some country be seek to stoke division at cop but that be exactly what his government have be do in recent week on net zero the rest of the european union have set the deadline of it be right that the united kingdom government set the ambition for but we recognise that thing be change we have have covid and there be still need to roll out infrastructure think the hon lady be be ungenerous since we will now be in line with the rest of the european union and we have high take up of evs than many other country in all the conversation have with business they say that they want certainty and strategic sense of direction they want to know where they be go so we should not move the goalpost there be no reason to row back from that target and as have say the motor industry itself have express concern that industry need to develop market in new vehicle now so that in few year time we will have the affordable second hand market that we need so that people can afford to make the transition the right hon lady be absolutely right that the infrastructure be not there but that be challenge that we should rise to get comprehensive network of public sector charging point grid connection and so on she will have hear that from labour at its recent party conference let turn to domestic progress again to listen to the minister one would think that everything be go swimmingly the climate change committee have assess that the uk be unlikely to meet its ndc to reduce emission by between and the government own carbon budget delivery plan concede that ministers only have plan for of our ndc but they have say that they be confident about deliver those emission saving that be something we often hear from the minister without any actual detail about how we will get there in fact it have be assess that the government have credible plan for only of the require emission reduction there be lot of work to be do the climate change committee assess the government policy in october with and without the prime minister climate climbdown and find increase in the proportion of the ndc pathway cover by insufficient plan have take into account the prime minister intervention it say that the widespread uncertainty for consumer and supply chain be more difficult to quantify but as have say at all the meeting have have people be say that this have absolutely knock they off course there be huge amount of enthusiasm for go down the path to net zero and be tell that there be lot of private sector finance ready to invest but they need stable economic climate not prime minister who be turn just when action be need follow the disastrous contract for difference auction the proportion of the electricity supply pathway with significant risk increase by over the refusal to help renter contribute to fivefold increase in insufficient plan for building when the government policy be as the climate change committee find make net zero considerably hard to achieve and drive up energy bill how can ministers go to cop try to boast about how well thing be go in the uk do hope for action before cop we have the autumn statement next week and we be expect some plan think the chancellor promise in the spring that he would bring they forward in response to the inflation reduction act and the measure we then see in the eu hope that we do get something on that front to at least reassure business that the government still have net zero in their sight and see it as an important part of future industrial strategy for we the uk use to be at the forefront of global climate action and again the minister be be bit cheeky when talk about the progress that have be make since think he enter parliament when do in be that right indicate assent the minister may recall be on the green benches in when the labour government introduce the world first climate change act which be then adopt by more than country around the world it be groundbreake if the hon lady want to have history lesson and we do indeed come in together she will remember that it be david cameron as the leader of the conservatives who be the first leader of major party in this country to call for climate act think the liberal democrats leader follow suit few hour later and the labour government then eventually do so serve on the joint committee chair by the brilliant david puttnam that put this into place so will not take any lecture from she it be the conservatives who lead the charge to get that go the first major party to support it and be pleased to see it put on the statute book we be of course the first major economy in the world and the first government to legislate for net zero overall it be labour climate change act bring in by the now shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero my right hon friend the member for doncaster north edward miliband can see why the minister may be desperate to try to claim credit for it because the government have so little else that they can claim credit for but it be labour act introduce by labour government it be because that be enact that we have see so much progress and as have say it be take as model for many other country to follow however we be now set entirely the wrong example to other country by scale back on our net zero ambition and last year the prime minister have to be force to attend cop will the hon lady give way the minister will have an opportunity to respond in his wind up at the end but suppose will give way once more this be really important topic and it be important that we get our language right the government have not scale back our net zero ambition for either our ndc in or net zero by the hon lady can make lot of point partisan or otherwise but it would be great if she acknowledge that this country have under this conservative government cut emission by more than any other major economy on earth and have the most ambitious plan for the minister will also know that the government have to be take to court because it be one thing declare target and ambition but unless they have the the government be take to court and that be why they have to produce the delivery plan early this year the climate change committee which by his account be all his idea because it be all his idea to introduce the climate change act have say that the government be not on track to meet their ambition so the minister can not just rely on grandiose boast about where he want to get we to if he do have not have plan to get we there and it be very clear that he do not have plan to get we there the minister say that we represent only of global emission which be true but the ndc emission gap be approximately the total combine annual emission from the top three emit country yes they have responsibility but this do need everybody everywhere to play their part do not think we would want to try to suggest that we be insignificant in the big global picture because we represent only of the total population will move on specifically to the cop agenda and what we hope to see will the uk be call for the phase out of unabated fossil fuel and do the minister agree with the global stocktake be just about to come to that know the minister mention it but do he agree with the global stocktake report that fossil fuel subsidy be stifle cost effective low carbon alternative the global stocktake report state that lifetime emission from exist and planned fossil fuel infrastructure will exceed estimate for keeping within reach my point be that if the uk will be call for the phase out of unabated fossil fuel how do he think go to cop when the government have just announce the offshore petroleum licensing bill in the king speech will sit when he try to lecture other country on move away from fossil fuel the global stocktake report be clear that removal have role but be not substitute for deep emission reduction it state rapid reduction of the world economy reliance on fossil fuel towards clean energy be central for reach global net zero that sound to like an endorsement of labour clean energy mission for unlike the government short term approach this will increase our energy security create good job and reduce energy bill unlike as the secretary of state for energy security and net zero admit the other day the offshore petroleum licensing bill and it will mean that the uk be lead the world in tackle the climate crisis the minister mention nature base solution and be very pleased to hear that but can he say bit more about what global action the government will be support with sustainable land management understand that that will be on the agenda at cop in way that it have not be in the past as well as terrestrial and ocean carbon sequestration what discussion be there likely to be on the role of set up credible international carbon market to give one example we know that wetland have huge potential but we be still wait to hear about the saltmarsh code the former secretary of state for department for environment food and rural affairs the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey may have something to say about that and whether we can add saltmarshe to the greenhouse gas inventory with the uk lead position as world financial centre we be ideally place to be play role in create these market both on the nature side and on the carbon side it be estimate that tree loss last year be high than the maximum level will the minister update we on that he mention halt and reverse deforestation by and on the international side that be very much about stamp out link to deforestation in our supply chain could he give an update on how that be go because as understand it it be not go well those issue be all highlight in the global stocktake the build environment and transport be also on the cop agenda and it would be helpful if the minister could tell we little more about the government priority for the talk he mention the loss and damage fund and the work of the transitional committee it would be interesting to know more about what conversation he have have with climate vulnerable country and the small island develop state in particular because it be one thing to set up these financial arrangement but in the past the small country the few resource it have and it find it very difficult to access the finance that be out there the minister also mention the need to reform international financial institution which be welcome do not know whether he intend to reveal much about his actual agenda at cop before he go and it would be useful to know who else be go with he but one question that have be ask of be whether he will be attend the ministerial event on methane on december think it be really important that we start address methane in connection both with the fossil fuel sector and with agriculture and waste hope that will be priority for he to conclude the un have previously warn that the world be on course for catastrophic of warming in part because promise make at and have not be fulfil we be run out of last chance but we can still avert the very bad of it because we have the knowledge and tool to do so it be just the willpower that be lack at the moment the uk under labour will as call for in the global stocktake transform our energy system with plan to double onshore wind treble solar and quadruple offshore wind our warm home plan will see million cold and draughty home bring up to standard and labour answer to the inflation reduction act will restore britain international leadership and create job across the country our proposal for clean power alliance will lead ambitious country and support the most vulnerable net zero target should not lead to complacency there be so much more that the uk can and must do not only to reduce emission but to deliver energy security reduce energy bill and enable british industry to thrive over the long term that be the vision we need to see at cop it be pleasure to contribute to this debate will be vital recognise the global stocktake that will be happen and commend the government on the progress they have make while also recognise not just in this country but around the world the necessity of just transition pay tribute to the prime minister who in his speech couple of month ago recognise that we have already be do so well on aspect of the carbon budget he also recognise some of the impact that be about to unfold particularly in rural community like mine in suffolk coastal include transition away from oil boiler something that we all want he be allow more time for that to happen rather than the sudden impact that such measure could have have on many people in my constituency and across the country his speech be also about aspect of housing and the energy performance certificate undoubtedly in many rural part of the country try to achieve epc standard be difficult because there be pretty old housing not just from or year ago but considerably old try to make that change mean that lot of building be at risk of be remove from the private rental sector which would not be good in term of housing people in our rural community also commend the prime minister on say in key part of his speech at in sharm el sheikh last year that there be no solution to climate change without protect and restore nature that be right again the united kingdom should be proud of how it have put nature and nature base solution at the heart of ensure that we achieve net zero around the world in her speech my political heroine margaret thatcher highlight the risk to the world of climate change she be pivotal in ensure that the montreal protocol and its subsequent amendment be an innovative way indeed the most successful agreement ever reach to try to tackle climate change the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol be ratify by this parliament in and be pleased to be the defra minister who lead that ratification the critical outcome of that be to try to prevent of warming which will help indeed that be the single big contribution that will be make towards keep the goal of alive this be about how we tackle the issue in variety of way in particular how we use hydrofluorocarbon in the past it be chlorofluorocarbon and think about the global warming power of the different chemical we use in my constituency gah transport have be in operation for year it be small business but it be really make an impact with the amount of research and innovation that it be undertake to try to use more of the sort of chemical that reduce global warming potential that will be an important part of the innovation we need not just in this country but around the world be delighted that the uk government be fund through international climate finance and other aspect of official development assistance important progress in india and rwanda that be important progress in the cool challenge that those country face not only when heating or cool home but also particularly in rwanda work with other african nation nearby when think about the impact on agriculture and how we can try to reduce food waste we be support that important innovation to ensure that we keep the goal of alive have one request for the minister the united arab emirates which be take up the presidency have not ratify the kigali amendment and encourage he to raise that with the president and ministers for that country to see whether they can do that we need leadership across the world the amendment be already in effect because sufficient number of country have sign but it would show further leadership from the uae to undertake that important ratification admit that be bit of veteran of cop go to in bonn in and to in katowice we have the magnificent in glasgow with our own president my right hon friend the member for reading west sir alok sharma in many way that be game changer for nature and it be strengthen last year at in sharm el sheikh go back to bonn nature be really the cinderella of it all the ocean we be already see the change and the impact of climate change we be start to see acidification although the sea be still alkaline they be get more acidic and it be important to recognise that power and how nature have help we ocean have effectively be absorb so much carbon that the impact what that be do to nature be now start to become clear the hon member for bristol east kerry mccarthy mention the bleaching of coral reef and the potential loss of those reef and it be important that nature go hand in hand with climate strategy be delighted that the uk government have make that key part of what we do on other aspect of nature the minister and have attend variety of international meeting most recently we be together in india for the and be with the former secretary of state for energy security and net zero my right hon friend the member for welwyn hatfield grant shapps in japan at the it have be an important part of that journey that we work globally with partner to some extent that have be the secret of what make the montreal protocol work so well funding be give to try to help country around the world with that innovation and transition some of those thing be not straightforward for example right beneath we we have the tube system and the way that some of these chemical or gas be use in the past have be key part of some of our own infrastructure we need to change away from that in particular by not use sulphur hexafluoride any more or by reduce it and phase it down as far as we can it be important that we share our understanding and technology and that be why what say about india and rwanda be an important part of make that happen think little more broadly will briefly touch on my time at the department for work and pensions do so because know that lot of these measure will need financing we make an important decision to make reporting to the task force on climate relate financial disclosures mandatory when it come to pension if we think about the trillion of pound of asset that be in global business and be invest it make sense for business to think ahead about the impact of climate change and for investor to do so as well that do not mean that thing will happen overnight business must be conscious of what the impact of climate change will be and frankly they need to start finance to try to mitigate that impact or adapt towards it as slight aside welcome the taskforce on nature relate financial disclosures and hope can persuade the secretary of state for the department for work and pensions to adopt that in future as well in order to ensure that we achieve net zero by we do have to think of the planet of course we do and we have to think of people lot of this be quite an uncomfortable transition and change to way of life and we must make it as straightforward as possible also know that we can be prosperous as consequence of these change whether that be through green job in the uk or ensure that instead of spend lot of money on have to adapt mitigate or deal with crisis in different part of the world we build such measure into our systematic way of grow globally in term of our prosperity that be why it be so important that the billion of international climate finance be still key part of the government strategy my constituency contain nuclear power station sizewell it be home to sizewell which be now be decommission and planning consent have be give for sizewell it really matter for our energy supply that we have mix there be also lot of offshore wind in the southern north sea the impact on the onshore infrastructure require to bring that into our network be source of much concern in suffolk and know that my right hon friend the minister be well aware of that will not dwell on that intend to bring it up another time but to take the national and global position we need to work out how we will make that transition fair think of the impact on community and on nature know that my right hon friend be wise about those matter the shadow minister refer to the greenhouse gas inventory agree that we should look to bring saltmarsh woodland and so on into the inventory be delighted that defra chief scientific adviser dr gideon henderson be undertake that work wish he well and hope he will be able to work at pace will shortly talk about mangrove my favourite they be magic and it would not be speech from if do not talk about they and we have to recognise that saltmarsh be our equivalent of mangrove in my time previously in defra and in the past year try but do not quite get there really need the marine management organisation to work much more collaboratively with natural england and the environment agency to make it more straightforward to plant saltmarsh there have be too many complication with licensing in different way and it be very frustrating like mangrove saltmarsh be multipurpose it can sequester carbon it can be good flood defence and it be brilliant habitat for many of the migratory wad bird that come to our shore be very keen that we make good progress on make that happen on emission want to thank robert caudwell who do report for defra on lowland peat and the impact of farming and agriculture write the foreword to the government response early this year and welcome the investment towards tackle the emission because it be significant amount it be of course important that we have food security but we also need to tackle emission from agriculture in measured way wide work on the restoration of peatland have be passion of mine for several year my right hon friend mention deforestation which be one of the key element of in the leader pledge various declaration and the coalition of ambition be know for want to make sure we turn ambition into action and know that the house will share that thought be therefore delight that we be able to contribute to the amazon fund which will help brazil in particular that be announce by the prime minister early this year progress be be make on get the forest risk commodity legislation ready and hope it will be lay before the house before too long it be important that as we make these change we do our good to reduce deforestation and our demand through supply chain and commend the company that have already make those change there be more to do and hope more will be do very shortly nature base solution can be symbiotic and provide much more value for money in achieve what we want to achieve it have not always be the case that action take to reduce carbon have be beneficial to the environment that be not criticism the dash for diesel have other impact especially with particulate matter people do not know at the time but we should recognise now that the dash for diesel have an impact on other aspect of the environment and it be important that we consider both as we make further change have particular passion for mangrove try to brand they blue forest to make they bit more accessible around the world but they be magical they be magic because bang for buck they be well at carbon sequestration than the amazon forest they have be in place for long time but they be also under threat because they make brilliant wood for build home and boat commend country such as mozambique that have put in national protection we should think about how much of the commonwealth have mangrove because at the moment they do not get reward for the protection they have put in place community do understand it be not just about carbon what be magic about mangrove be that they provide brilliant place to develop aquaculture the fishing industry locally can be sustainable because of the opportunity for the growth of fish stock and protection from other predator just by the nature of the mangrove they also have an impact on coastal erosion and protection haiti in the caribbean suffer devastating hurricane some year ago but while the area with mangrove be still damage they be the quick to recover that be why be on mission and will continue to be so as long as have breath to champion mangrove whether in this house or as regularly do in ministerial meeting around the world the magic of mangrove need to be recognise more and that be why be pleased that for the uae make commitment to plant more mangrove my right hon friend the minister and go different way after the in chennai and have the privilege of visit the second large mangrove forest in the world at pichavaram and it be exceptionally special love that the community also recognise how special the forest be and how important it be to protect it be conscious that other part of the world have have slash and burn approach in the past to generate other aspect of the economy but now government and community have recognise the importance of stop deforestation as my right hon friend mention on the history of climate change give credit to the labour government who introduce the climate act and we take generally cross party approach to it david cameron introduce vote blue go green and be really behind the change the act legislate for an reduction by and it be actually my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may when she be prime minister who make the change to reduction by law those legal target matter we should also recognise that it be boris johnson who really make difference at he bring nature and the world together to make sure that we would keep up the momentum there be no doubt in my mind that covid be bit of body check to progress on many environmental matter but it be important that we keep accelerate and wish my right hon friend the minister well at know that several ministers be go include lord benyon from defra and my successor as the secretary of state it matter that we be there we need to bring other with we but they will not come with we if we just attack what they do just last week be in beijing where meet minister huang the president of the committee on biological diversity that lead to the immense global biodiversity framework agree last december in montreal we have to work with china and with other country think in particular of minister yadav in india be able to explain what think be the prime minister just transition but we certainly can not reduce our ambition we have to work with other country and challenge they but bring they along because it matter that everybody make their commitment it do not matter if the united kingdom or any other country be the first to reach net zero what matter be when the last country hit net zero we need to ensure that as many country as possible achieve that by if not before and wish my right hon friend the minister well in the negotiation know there be ambition in our thinking about some of the different approach that need to be take hope that he will also be key to the commonwealth play its part at the un general assembly be delighted to chair the first meeting of commonwealth ministers for environment and climate and there be certainly ambition there let we turn that into action have great confidence in my right hon friend make that happen call the snp spokesperson will start with short reality check climate scientist be forecast with near certainty that will set new record as the hot year october global temperature soar above the average for that month accord to the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration september surpass the average july temperature from to those record be not merely be break but be shatter heatwave drought and flood have result in significant human suffering claim thousand of life disrupt livelihood and displace score of people the burden of these climactic shift fall disproportionately on those region and community that have contribute least to the crisis east africa region with minimal contribution to global carbon emission have face devastating drought and famine with estimate early this year suggest that two life be be lose every minute meanwhile low lie nation such as tuvalu face the real threat of extinction in the come decade be create digital back up of their entire existence and culture complete with ancestral knowledge and value system as we approach it be therefore encouraging although long overdue that the conference will focus more on frontline community and especially those in least develop country and small island that emphasis must translate into tangible financial support that be an area where scotland have set precedent as the first country in the global north to commit fund to climate loss and damage pledge million at last year the scottish government allocate an additional million to non economic loss and damage support initiative preserve the heritage of affected community those sum be of course small compare with what be require globally finance provide by rich country to help the poor deal with climate change remain woefully inadequate however the scottish government action have encourage other to follow with about million thought to have be pledge globally to address loss and damage at landmark agreement be reach to establish dedicated fund aim explicitly at support vulnerable nation and community who be grapple with the irreversible effect of climate change that action must be accelerate and the finance offer must be additional to that already available for mitigation and adaptation and it must be in the form of grant not loan support for adaptation initiative be simply inadequate country of the global north not only bear substantial responsibility for the destructive consequence of climate change through our emission but have benefit from the competitive advantage that the early adoption of fossil fuel and industrialisation provide therefore surely wealthy nation have moral obligation to recognise that historical responsibility and lead by example first minister humza yousaf and cabinet secretary for net zero and just transition màiri mcallan who will represent scotland at the conference will make that case to delegate action to address loss and damage get to the heart of what we mean by climate justice it be principle that be equally important at home as it be globally the scottish government be commit to end our reliance on fossil fuel in way that be fair and leave no one behind that be exemplify by the just transition fund the scottish government year million investment to support project in the north east and moray as those region transition to net zero the principle of just transition be also enshrine in the climate change scotland act emphasise the creation of green sustainable job and address economic inequality the action need to reach net zero by will transform all sector of our economy and society and will require rapid structural change in scotland and indeed throughout the uk we have see how unplanned structural change in the past have leave intergenerational scarring and deprivation most notably in our former coalmining community our transition to net zero must be manage differently in october alone we have experience two extreme rainfall event include storm babet which disrupt transport destroy infrastructure and crop lead to the evacuation of community and tragically take life in scotland and across the uk the health of our environment economy and society be interlink with how well we mitigate climate change and adapt to its impact that be why the scottish government be make an extra million available in this parliamentary term on top of million annually for flood risk management and million on coastal adaptation the scottish government climate change plan update outline nearly policy set pathway to meet our ambitious emission target by include reduction by we have reach significant milestone in almost of scotland gross electricity consumption in scotland be generate from renewable source although the scottish government have meet target and miss other at the last count the government miss their annual emission target by only that tell we two thing the action of the scottish government be help we to track very closely to where we need to be against the backdrop of some of the most stretching target in the world equally there be great deal leave to do of course the delivery of scotland climate ambition be also contingent on action by the uk government in reserved and share area and that certainly have not be help by the prime minister recent abandonment of key net zero commitment the sheer scale of his policy reversal may have significant impact on scotland not least in the preparation of our own draft climate change plan be afraid that the king speech only deepen those concern the problem with the announce new licensing system have be highlight by both climate scientist and anti poverty campaigner so do not need to go into they but analysis from early this year show that new oil and gas field in the north sea will produce only enough gas to meet the uk need for few week year if the government be serious about strengthen the uk energy security and bring down people energy bill they would start by announce robust measure to incentivise investment in renewable think in particular of tidal stream speak about that regularly in this house similar to what we be see from the eu and the us as well as match the scottish government million just transition fund people in scotland be rightly ask how it be possible that they be face unaffordable energy bill when in scotland produce enough renewable energy to power the equivalent of every household in the country for more than three year they be also wonder why in country where we produce six time more gas than we consume age scotland figure suggest that scandalous of people age to be live in fuel poverty we be also see the damaging impact of brexit on environmental protection and standard which member on the snp benches warn of repeatedly the tories retained eu law revocation and reform act threaten the high standard that scotland enjoy as an eu member before we be remove against the wish of the clear majority of people in our country just this week we hear the uk government plan to reduce the safety information require from chemical company to register substance to an irreducible minimum the uk registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemical uk reach be already fall behind the eu regulation and that move will only heighten the risk of toxic substance enter the environment in the realm of national security the defence committee recent report on climate change find that the ministry of defence could do much more to measure and reduce its carbon emission without erode military capability hear what the hon lady say about chemical the government be plan to produce new chemical strategy she may not be aware that the european union refuse to allow the united kingdom access to all the information on reach the cost of replicate exactly the same information be huge she need to be mindful that we be try to support business while recognise that the european union could have give we access and refuse to do so that be just another complication cause by brexit which have be disaster for the uk as mention in the realm of national security the defence committee have take close interest for some time so it seem that some sort of environmental audit would be appropriate for ministry of defence activity whoever win the next election face long road to rectify the decision of the current government hon member should not take my word for it but it do not bode well for the uk stand on the climate crisis ahead of lord deben the former chair of the climate change committee say in the summer that by fail to act decisively in response to the energy crisis and building on the success of host the uk have lose its claim to global climate leadership to restore influence and authority ahead of the prime minister should take heed of the letter from the all party parliamentary group for climate change which member from different party across the chamber have sign it call on the prime minister to appoint secretary of state level uk climate envoy ahead of after the government scrap the role of special representative on climate change within the foreign commonwealth and development office we want the uk government to support climate vulnerable country by commit new and additional grant base finance to the loss and damage fund and champion just global energy transition by engage with affected worker and support other country to fairly move away from fossil fuel as we all know the paris agreement bind country to stop the planet heating by by the end of the century however current policy be set to heat it by about that trajectory spell disaster for the planet we must play our part in reverse it immediately as chair of the all party parliamentary group for water sanitation and hygiene declare an interest relevant to this debate and to the future of our globe be honour to be part of this debate on such an important issue no other important issue be raise so many time by young people when visit school in putney southfields and roehampton and by the many member of the putney environment commission which set up shortly after be elect for local people interested in take action on climate internationally nationally and locally last night we have meeting about what we can do to rewild local street in london and be look forward to play our part in action before and after the united nations climate change conference will attend the conference with delegation of mp it be important that parliamentarian be at the conference meet expert and activist who be all work towards ensure green future and the action on climate and nature that be so important for our long term survival this year will be the hot year on record every day we witness the climate crisis unfold from the effect of el niño to the uk batter by storm after storm currently between billion and billion people live in area that be highly vulnerable to climate change the world poor people include woman and girl so often on the frontline be pay the high price under current estimate we face shortfall in fresh water by not very far away water scarcity be escalate which affect trade economy poverty reduction food and nutrition but also migration an issue that be subject of many debate in this house and will only be exacerbate by climate change that be the tip of the iceberg the disruption and damage that the climate crisis cause and will cause to all our life can not be overstate as the minister say the world be badly off track to agree the paris agreement target and keep alive the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey mention mangrove forest be also fan have be to visit mangrove forest in bangladesh when work for water aid have the privilege of visit coastal community in bangladesh where the climate crisis be already extremely real it use to be freshwater area where people survive by fishing but it have be salinate sit with group of woman in that rural area where they could not harvest or grow anything there be nothing they could do they want to move anywhere else but be stick in an area that seem arid like desert from the future where climate change be make such an impact on community have say many time that climate change be not something that will happen to we it be happen now that be understand by the recent cop but need to be understand even more if we be too late there will be no concrete action to effect change at the scale we need the main outcome need at be obvious an agreement for no new fossil fuel many organisation such as the international energy agency have say that to achieve global net zero emission by the year there should be no new fossil fuel extraction project beyond those already commit how can the government believe that approve more than new north sea oil and gas project be in any way in line with that the legal framework or the view of the vast majority of voter as other country forge ahead with renewable the uk be lag behind we need to keep it in the ground it be very simple unless we and other country get this right there will not be the progress we need climate justice be very important make sure that low and middle income country can respond to climate impact be essential hope that will be one of the big outcome of in rich government agree to provide billion in climate finance annually to develop country but that goal which originally be mean to be fulfil by have still not be meet the billion adaptation and mitigation finance that the uk pledge in be more loan base than grant base and so only increase debt for the world most indebted country some of our climate finance be grant base be very glad to hear that that need to be the future because grant base instead of loan base be vital be glad that there have be change along the way as result of lot of campaigning highlight five area of concern first on phase out fossil fuel the uk government must play their part in end the fossil fuel era by commit to cease direct and indirect funding of overseas fossil fuel project include those finance by british international investment and instead commit to rapidly scale up investment in renewable energy at home secondly on the loss and damage fund government at must commit to design loss and damage fund with adequate grant base funding arrangement and specific plan to support country face economic and non economic loss and damage the polluter must pay the fossil fuel industry be post record profit but it should be pay for the damage it be cause the uk government must commit to provide their fair share of funding through grant base funding arrangement and should have specific plan to support country that face both economic and non economic loss and damage the third concern be the need to fulfil climate finance pledge the uk government must meet their own climate finance commitment with additional new fund not by re badging finance already give to british international investment or the world bank the fourth concern be the need to reform the global food system in order to tackle the climate crisis action on food and action by farmer go hand in hand with tackle climate change government at must to commit to transform food system through progress on the sharm el sheikh joint work on agriculture alongside that the uk government must develop cross departmental strategy on provide support for more resilient food system internationally that prioritise the need of small scale farmer small scale farmer be really the climate activist on the frontline of climate change they will be the good advocate and will take the good action on climate change but they need funding and support to do so the fifth concern be the need to invest in climate resilient water sanitation and hygiene project and the need for policy that enable people to respond to immediate threat and to adapt to the impact of climate change where they be people do not want to leave where they live because of climate change they absolutely want to stay where they be but with water for agriculture to grow crop and to live in hygienic condition the climate crisis be also crisis of health around the world as we see with covid we need to be able to wash our hand that be such basic need healthcare centre need adequate water and sanitation the climate crisis threaten advance in sanitation which threaten advance in poverty reduction we must also ensure we keep clean water wherever it be find labour will take far fast action on the environment labour know that this be an exciting opportunity for economic growth for new industry and for job creation we will insulate million home within decade under our warm home plan which will cut bill by up to and create million job we will act fast to lead the world as clean and cheap energy superpower by we will establish gb energy new home grow publicly own champion of clean energy generation so that we can be really world lead in the action that we take at home we will deliver thousand of high quality job to every corner of this great country labour believe that we need just transition to net zero economy that can not be leave to the whim of the market as be the de industrialisation of the social justice must be at the centre of our response to the climate and environment emergency and fairness must shape our approach to the green transition here at home we have to actively shape that green transition so that no one be leave behind and people and place be protect throughout ecological breakdown be also major problem the uk be one of the most nature deplete country on earth labour will ensure that we not only halt but reverse the loss of biodiversity in the uk by in conclusion look forward to attend this year go to many international conference in my previous work before be an mp always go with high hope and always leave with high degree of disappointment feel that we could have go far could almost write the conference press release before go but maintain high degree of hope and optimism as more and more people work together internationally to take on the crisis all around the world the green sprint have now begin there be surge in renewable green technology and economic growth we be make at pace some of the technological advance that be need if we be to achieve the necessary outcome for our climate and they be become affordable hope we can come together to stave off the bad of the impact to climate and nature and together create well and more prosperous world it be pleasure to follow the hon member for putney fleur anderson she may be disappoint by what she hear from other but she never disappoint with what she say in this house we be in pakistan back in february we have an interest in issue relate to persecution and freedom of religious belief and in how we can help through work on human right she be experience and knowledgeable on the subject of water and we visit some encouraging project but we be remind of the impact in part of the world where unlike here water be scarce commodity be very happy to speak in the debate and can not believe it be again time for the annual cop meeting this year it be in dubai where be sure the weather will be much well than in the uk give the storm we have recently this year cross cut theme aim to address our main target technology inclusion finance and line community it be great that we have the opportunity to discuss these issue it be always pleasure to provide northern ireland perspective in debate in this chamber and elsewhere so that we have united and joint approach to our climate change and net zero target it be also pleasure to see the minister in his place be encourage by some of the thing he refer to such as the target meet and the goal achieve believe in give credit to those who do well at the same time if target be not meet then we challenge let we put on record our thank where goal have be achieve it be also pleasure to hear from the labour shadow minister the hon member for bristol east kerry mccarthy and the snp shadow the hon member for edinburgh north and leith deidre brock they make valuable contribution as other have declare an interest as member of the ulster farmers union because will speak about agriculture across the world we have fire flood drought and tsunamis those thing do not just happen man and woman have role to play in the world in which we all live nature would suggest be angry it be nature way of remind we that what we do have repercussion to go back to northern ireland it be no secret how crucial our agriculture sector be live on farm all my neighbour be farmer and most of they be dairy man farming be the large emitting sector in northern ireland contribute some of emission and that increase over the year cover by the statistical bulletin to which refer the government the ulster farmers union and the national farmers union have commit to reduce those emission and it be important that that happen it be no secret how challenging it be to cut emission large organisation such as the ulster farmers union and the nfu have have to cope and adapt in short space of time so it be promise to see that cop will address that this year it be important that that happen on december the theme for the day will be food and agriculture the aim will be to address innovation investment regenerative agriculture and national transformation that be positive sign that our agricultural industry be be give the mean of contribute to climate target at the democratic unionist party conference about month ago the ufu have stand and it have paper on how to achieve net zero target be under no illusion farmer landowner my neighbour and the union be totally committed to do their bit to achieve climate target there be definitely clear central role for farmer many comparison can be make between the state of our climate and prevail health issue across the uk and far afield as my party health spokesperson be greatly pleased that health issue will also be address at cop it look like terrific conference and there be lot of key issue on the agenda that would like discuss have be in contact with organisation about the clean air programme which be tackle the air quality issue face we all for the first time at cop summit full day agenda have be devote this year to initiative design to protect livelihood and support community resilience and stability in the face of the advance effect of climate change while some may say that there be no such thing as climate change the fact the evidence that we all have in front of we tell we that there be and that something must be do about it there will be high level discussion about the importance of clean air which have be prove to lead to improvement in both mental and physical health some three week ago speak in debate about circular economy and their importance in our local community ard and north down council which cover the area in which both work and reside have proven commitment to act sustainably to create vibrant and healthy economy recognise the contribution that local council and devolve administration can make to net zero target across the uk be perhaps the small but most important step to take in regulate environmental sustainability the scottish parliament the welsh assembly and the northern ireland assembly all have key role to play we all play that role in our own place but when we all come together it be the teamwork that deliver whether we discuss these issue at event as large as cop or more internally back home in local council chamber we will never progress without have the conversation it be great and commendable that effort in that regard be be make at all level of government look forward sincerely to hear the comment make at and not only from the perspective of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland again it be no secret that love this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and believe that it be well together some may have different opinion at least one member who be in the chamber now perhaps but the rest of we be commit to the importance of that when it come to look far afield and globally the united kingdom of scotland wales england and northern ireland as well as all the region have part to play at all political level council regional and westminster cop provide an opportunity for joint and united approach to meet our target and that be something that we have to achieve there be no if about it there be no question we must ensure that effort be make in this place to achieve those goal call the minister to wind up the debate congratulate all the member who have speak in the debate which be an important one ahead of far to the other interaction that mention in my opening speech we will be make write ministerial statement on our priority for cop before we go and will be responsible for the negotiation there it have be very interesting debate but it be shame that the hon member for bristol east kerry mccarthy struggle so much to acknowledge the position that we be in have never hear it come out of her mouth that this country have cut its emission more than any other major economy on this earth which it have or that it have the most ambitious plan of any economy on this earth which it have it would be good to have that as baseline there be plenty of room to pick up on issue and concern about our performance while also acknowledge that the uk truly be global leader be pleased to say we be not only lead domestically but lead in the international space as well couple of member mention the climate change committee in the context of the prime minister speech in september it be worth note that the climate change committee analysis show that there be no material difference in our progress in cut emission since its last report in june we be tack as would put it however our destination remain exactly the same we be reassure people in rural area who be fearful that they could neither afford heat pump nor be sure of their functionality while increase the subsidy for they by and work to build the system and drive the cost curve down so that more and more home can have they that be right the way to ensure that we maintain public support for deliver net zero the same apply to zero emission vehicle manufacturer have zev mandate an obligation to green their fleet up to that build on our successful record to date we be ahead of the climate change committee and our own projection we be maintain that zev mandate the climate change committee speak of no material difference in progress on particular change but the focus on grid and other aspect of the prime minister speech be all about turbocharge our effort to deliver not only the nationally determine contribution in but net zero by methane be mention and it be an important issue the global methane pledge be collective commitment intend to mobilise international action on methane be pleased to say that uk methane emission between and drop by one of the large reduction in any oecd country but should also to highlight the fact that methane represent one of our big opportunity the opportunity to ensure that that pledge be deliver not only domestically but internationally it should also be note that we be the only major economy to set legally bind emission reduction target of for as part of carbon budget we will see what happen at the cop in year on from paris but the expectation be that new ndc will come forward for finance be touch on in the debate we remain one of the large and most active donor in international climate finance and we be make record commitment with the aim of help the world to adapt to the inevitable climate change impact that we can already see at the prime minister make commitment to triple uk adaptation finance from million in to billion in the uk be also commit to maintain balance between mitigation and adaptation spending and to provide at least billion of uk climate finance for the purpose of protect and restore nature we provide the majority of our climate finance in the form of much need grant rather than loan which think compare well with what be provide by some other donor country and we prioritise our contribution for the big challenge face by the poor and most vulnerable alongside malawi and vanuatu co chair the climate and development ministerial ahead of the abu dhabi pre cop meeting it focus on the issue of access which be absolutely right we hear again and again from country such as samoa whose minister have say that the access process take too long at the cdm we set out vision statement express great recognition of the need for national programme development to ease access to money as well as increase the quantum the hon lady be right it be not enough to have this notional money if it do not actually flow to those who by definition as she say be the least able administratively to meet the requirement of some vast organisation we need to make sure that the system fit the need of those it serve rather than the other way round welcome what the minister have say think that another problem for those country be come up with the evidence base to demonstrate the impact that climate change be have on they there be currently some very good initiative for example science student from the uk be go out to study marine area there be great deal of interchange do the minister think we could do more to facilitate that evidence gathering which could then be use as basis for make an application to show the need for climate adaptation funding the hon lady be absolutely right we need to make sure that technical assistance be there because even as we try to get the green climate fund the global environment facility the world bank and various other to improve their system and ambition to well meet the need of the most vulnerable shout at both party be like shove nine pin plug and three pin plug together and wrap they in gaffer tape we also need to get smoother system that help they both to step up so that it genuinely flow otherwise we will have endless frustration hear ministers from vanuatu tuvalu samoa and elsewhere bring it alive which be why these international meeting be useful they remind we of the reality on the ground since the uk climate finance have support more than million people to cope with the effect of climate change improve the climate resilience of more than million people and reduce or avoid more than million tonne of greenhouse gas emission nature have rightly be mention and we want to see action and ambition from the presidency and all party on transform food system and building policy practice and investment for sustainable agriculture at scale that include endorsement of the leader declaration on food agriculture and climate action support by further commitment to policy action innovation and investment through the policy dialogue for sustainable agriculture and the agriculture breakthrough it be always difficult to keep our head around all these issue as there be an alphabet soup of initiative always want to check that they be not duplicative but they be often complementary and work together the minister be make very strong case for the disparate issue that the government be press on climate change if we be to reach net zero by there will also need to be massive increase in the supply of critical mineral whether for ev battery or solar panel when he be go around all these initiative at international level what discussion be he have with the like of brazil indonesia and other lynchpin partner about join the minerals security partnership that be the primary multilateral vehicle for address critical mineral thank my right hon friend for his question which come up frequently when be in riyadh recently speak about critical mineral with his royal highness prince abdulaziz the energy minister of saudi arabia which be critical in this piece whereas my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey go on to the mangrove go on to indonesia by way of vietnam and these conversation come up all the time my right hon friend the member for esher and walton dominic raab be right that make sure we have resilient supply chain be fundamental to deliver this we be do more on supply chain and we be do it fast than ever before even fast than the industrial revolution and it be not only happen here it be happen in other country at the same time as it need to so we have to make sure that our supply chain can meet that action we can well do that through collaboration it be not just about reach agreement on thing such as critical mineral it take many year to develop project and bring they through to production which create even more urgency to promote improve and responsible governance we be also look for commitment to support the forest and climate leader partnership at the world climate action summit at the beginning of cop we also want to see partnership on water resource at all level donor country and the private sector need to be involve too thank the minister for mention water he be talk about the many issue he will cover when he go to the various meeting so do he agree that water sanitation and hygiene be important issue to raise will he look out for they in the outcome document press release and statement that come out after the conference enjoy the hon lady speech unsurprisingly when be in the middle east recently water be right at the top of the agenda reflect its importance attend the net zero council meeting in manchester last thursday and it be my pleasure on the following day to go to the severn trent water treatment work in stoke by the end of next year it be expect to be the world first carbon neutral water treatment work for which pay tribute to severn trent again it show the importance of water which be so often forget water be one of the workstream of the net zero council which be establish this year to bring together the government and business to develop road map for each sector of our economy pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal for she drive heartfelt effort to make sure that nature contribution to the climate be fully recognise the reason for hold the climate and development ministerial be that climate and development be two side of the same coin if there could be three sided coin be stretch my metaphor the third side would be nature because climate development and nature go together we have talk about the importance of forest and we have to make sure that the people who live in and around these carbon sink they be not just carbon sink they have many other quality have economic incentive that align with what we want we have to make sure that they see development and opportunity for their family it be only on that basis that we can even ask they to protect the nature that have be so denude here if we be to ask other to protect their nature for the general benefit we need to make sure that it fit with development as well as contribute to climate and nature thank my right hon friend for suffolk coastal for all she have do her enthusiasm for mangrove be clearly share across the house they be bit of miracle make difference often cost lot of money so we have to try to align incentive as much as possible we need project in which very small amount of funding can make all the difference so that mangrove stop shrink and start expand and so that people return from the city to work with their family around the mangrove as part of prosperous community the mangrove need to be prosperous while develop as carbon sink it be very interesting to hear about the importance of mangrove would also be interested to hear what the minister have to say about peatland how will he be support they at cop the hon lady be absolutely right the congo have extraordinarily large and important peatland which have the same basic dynamic everything be different and every country be different which be why we have to pull different thing together but the fundamental principle be that we have to create system in which the local people from the governor of the province down to the indigenous villager be well off by maintain and keep these peatland we be keen to make sure that the role of peatland be understand because again they be critical enabler lose peatland can not easily be replace and they be part of the negative tipping point we could reach if we do not take urgent action welcome the minister enthusiasm and recognition that peatland have an important role to play but at the moment they be emit carbon because of how they be treat in this country particularly when it come to grouse moor management do he agree that we need to address those practice many peatland be also site of special scientific interest or be mean to be protect for nature in other way will not stumble into another department area of responsibility we work collectively across government to share the burden of make sure we meet our net zero target in wrap up the debate assure hon and right hon member of the government commitment to deliver on net zero at home and internationally although there be evidence that peak in global emission be within sight this decade we need emission to peak by and to reduce by by the sobering reality be that this year global emission be likely to reach new peak as member across the house have say keep within reach require nothing less than paradigm shift as say in my opening remark the uk account for less than of global emission beyond what be directly within our grasp the question before we be how we can help to create the will and the capability to move the remain for which the major emitter in particular will be crucial would like to close by offer some reflection on the uk role in help to drive forward international progress in this critical decade for hon member who be interested we have set out in great detail the uk vision and role in drive forward international action on climate and nature to in our strategic framework which be available online it set out six key global challenge and how we will use our international partnership strength in finance expertise and domestic leadership trade and investment and world lead strength in science and innovation to drive forward progress the first point to make be that though the gap look unassailably large we must not lose hope and fall into council of doom the reality be that effort to date have succeed in bend the emission curve away from apocalyptic level of warming of or more in some sector notably energy and electric car the transition be take off the iea late world energy outlook predict peak in fossil fuel use by due to what it describe as the unstoppable growth of low carbon technology solar and electric vehicle particularly stand out since only last year the iea have revise up its global solar capacity forecast by and increase by the number of electric vehicle it expect to be on the road by such that it be expect electric vehicle to comprise two third of new car sale by the lesson we should draw here be clear rapid large scale transformation be possible the challenge be that we need to replicate this success across all sector of the economy there will be no single silver bullet to drive the transformational systemic change that we need on global scale we will deploy every important lever we have to accelerate action in this critical decade build on the framework we put forward in the glasgow pact and our strategic framework that include work through the united nations framework convention on climate change bilaterally and through other channel work with other who be like minded and other we need to see country upgrade their climate target there be no point in have global stocktake eight year after the paris agreement if it do not lead to ratchet up of the nationally determined contribution to match the requirement that we find from the science in particular we need the major emitter to do that country represent more than of global gdp be cover as have say by some form of net zero target those country now need to align their near term target with the commitment that they have make we will harness our global diplomatic network international development offer and partnership to drive forward action we will also be take action to realign financial flow in line with the paris agreement and nature positive future we will use our strength as global green finance centre and role as shareholder of key financial institution to reorientate finance flow and tap the power of market to make progress towards unlock the trillion require we will accelerate transition globally through target collaboration with other focus on the most important highest emit sector through initiative such as the breakthrough agenda so that we can reach positive tipping point and avoid negative one and so that clean tech be affordable and accessible across all sector of the global economy we will also continue to push to accelerate the global energy transition for example through our long stand leadership on phase out coal in the powering past coal alliance we will also champion the need to phase out unabated fossil fuel and at the same time transition the north sea into clean energy powerhouse here at home let touch on that issue as it be raise by other we have new licence in the north sea for oil and gas because we continue to need oil and gas we will need oil and gas in and beyond our production be fall without new licence at rate of about with no new licence and no new investment we will not see greening of the basin bad we will see the loss of the subsea and offshore engineering capability we need as it will either leave this country or be make redundant rather than be retain here the hon member for edinburgh north and leith deidre brock raise the issue of just transition there be true transition to be make and oppose new oil and gas licence in this country when we be net importer of both and when the emission that will come from import such as liquified natural gas would be high make the opposition party friend of oil and gas worker but just not those in this country the approach of those party will not make any difference to how much we consume but it will make difference to our emission and not in good way and it will lose the very engineering capability we need to deliver the transition as well as very material contribution to our ability to make that change which be of course the billion of taxis that we expect to get from the sector over the next five year the opposition party be in entirely the wrong place they have put optic ahead of do the right thing and it do not take lot of reflection or analysis to come to the conclusion that we be do the right thing we must globally focus on the positive tipping point we need to accelerate the global low carbon transition thank hon member from across the house for their contribution to this debate and hope that my team and will be able to count on the support of everyone in the house despite all of the global challenge we face to make the upcoming cop the success that the world need it to be question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider court transcript costs motion make and question propose that this house do now largan be grateful to mr speaker for grant my request for debate on the cost of court transcript justice should not have price tag as think we would all agree yet many victim be be deny access to justice because they can not afford to pay thousand of pound to obtain court transcript not only be these extortionate cost unaffordable but they be major barrier to victim recovery this issue be first bring to my attention in august when my constituent juliana terlizzi approach my office for assistance in obtain court transcript in juliana be drug and then rap in her sleep by her former partner she be then force to wait two year for her case to be hear in court backlog and chaos in the court system push back the date time and time again meanwhile her attacker be free to walk the street and use date app to search for other woman in january juliana attacker be finally convict but she can barely remember what be say in the courtroom due to trauma and emotional distress follow the trial she be advise by therapist to apply for transcript of the proceeding to aid her healing this transcript would enable she to revisit and process what be say in court she make an application to the court for free copy of the transcript but her application be reject she be tell to contact one of the private company outsource by the government to supply transcript upon do so she be quote fee of an astonishing this be to read what happen in trial in which juliana herself be the to revisit what be say while her trauma be discuss by stranger in courtroom that cost simply do not stack up how can it be so high and why must juliana foot the bill my team and begin to research this issue some more and soon discover that juliana extortionate quote be not an isolated case with some victim face fee of up to how can anyone be expect to pay such fee court transcript should not be luxury that only those very few victim with thousand to spare can afford transcript be so important because they be often the only mean available to victim to establish exactly what happen during trial victim and bereaved family routinely do not attend trial some choose not to attend in order to avoid relive their trauma one victim tell that she would have be force to sit with her abuser friend and family in the gallery if she be present at the sentencing hearing other be misadvise by the police and court staff on their right to attend trial shockingly some victim be actively discourage from attend and tell that their presence would be distraction to the jury although the technology exist victim be often not offer video link to watch the trial remotely there be major lack of transparency of justice and lack of information provide to victim most victim will find out the verdict only by phone call if the outcome be not favourable what then how can victim even begin to come to term with the verdict when they have no mean of understand how it be reach even for victim such as juliana who be able to attend trial combination of trauma and legal jargon mean that it be extremely difficult to recall what be say transcript be therefore vital source of information for victim and bereaved family transcript can support their understanding and allow they to take step towards recovery the uk justice system be fail victim who feel like bystander to justice they have no contact with the prosecution no insight into proceeding and very limited information on their right as victim victim have tell that their experience in the uk justice system be retraumatise one even describe it as more traumatising than the crime commit against she our justice system must work to support victim and to encourage they to come forward without victim bravely report crime there can be no justice yet there be currently many disincentive to report crime our court be still plague by backlog and delay victim face average delay of day between crime be commit and case conclude at court justice delay be justice deny and it allow criminal to continue to walk the street for far too long the conservative government failure to get to grip with the backlog be let down victim and their family witness and defendant and it undermine public confidence in the justice system even when crime be report in many case the outcome be not favourable accord to rape crisis just of rape record by police between july and june result in someone be charge that same year let alone convict for those victim who finally see their case bring to court once the verdict be reach they be toss aside thing have to change the victims commissioner for london have be work tirelessly to shine light on the experience of victim in the uk justice system meet the commissioner to discuss the urgent reform need to well support victim and be proud to support her campaign for great transparency in our justice system the justice committee look into the issue of court transcript cost in three separate report over the last month the committee recommend that the government take step to improve access to court transcript and reduce cost the scottish criminal justice committee also complete an inquiry into transcription fee and successful campaign lead by rape survivor secure commitment from the scottish government to set up pilot scheme to waive court transcript fee for victim of sexual violence yet ministers in westminster continue to sit on their hand and allow private company to pass extortionate cost on to victim the victims and prisoners bill present the perfect opportunity to address this gross injustice today publish an open letter to the justice secretary call on the government to make provision within that bill to enable victim and bereaved family to request court transcript free of charge be delighted to be support by co signatory include member from six different party across the house among they the mother and the father of the house and the chair of the justice committee be also join by the victims commissioner for london and senior figure from the charity refuge rape crisis women aid and support after murder and manslaughter we stand united in support victim and their right to access justice the government often pay lip service to the importance of transparency and accessibility of justice in response to write question table in september the minister write access transcript from proceeding in serious criminal case be not only fundamental right of victim but be also essential for maintain transparency and accountability within the justice system welcome that statement from the minister and heartedly agree with his position so why be the government refuse to take step to ensure victim be able to access timely and accurate transcript free of charge the minister will point to the mechanism already in place to enable some victim and their family to obtain transcript such as permit sentencing remark to be make available at the judge discretion or measure to provide family bereave by homicide with sentencing remark but that be not enough countless victim be still unable to afford transcript and as prove in case such as juliana more often than not victim will be tell by the judge that their case do not meet the very narrow criterion for free transcript the government have say that provide transcript to victim free of charge would result in significant cost but that be not necessarily the case there be step the government could and should be take to reduce cost in report on open justice publish last year the justice committee recommend that his majesty courts and tribunals service should explore whether great use of technology such as ai power transcription could reduce the cost of produce court transcript will the minister provide an update on whether that recommendation have be act on additionally will the government look to assess the value for money of contract it hold with private transcription service be victim really get the good possible deal be fair price to pay write to the minister on september to set out proposal to provide an audio recording to victim upon request it should be possible to provide that at low or no cost as recording be already make of crown court proceeding two day ago receive response from the minister that say his official would give the matter careful consideration look forward to hear more when some progress have be make the government can not ignore victim any long victim and bereaved family need access to full accurate transcript of court proceeding anything less will be an injustice have table an amendment to the victims and prisoners bill that will enable victim to request transcript of court proceeding free of charge urge the government to accept the amendment in order to finally show victim that they matter that they do the right thing in come forward and that the uk justice system will support they during the trial and afterwards ahead of the bill report stage will the minister meet to discuss my amendment and the experience of my constituent his engagement on this issue be vital if the bill be to succeed in deliver positive outcome for victim thank the victim advocate and charity that have take the time to share their experience and insight with without their tireless campaigning change could never occur now hope the government will honour their work and commit to improve transparency and accessibility of justice for victim for that victim need access to full transcript free of charge congratulate the hon member for richmond park sarah olney on secure this important debate the principle that justice must be open and transparent go to the very heart of our justice system uphold this principle be paramount to secure the trust and confidence of victim whose experience be central to the way our society think about and respond to crime we be as like mind on that be sorry to hear about the experience of the hon lady constituent ms juliana terlizzi as she seek to obtain trial transcript as the victim of horrific crime recognise that there may be many reason why victim may find court transcript helpful in the aftermath of lengthy and sometimes complex criminal court proceeding in case where victim do not attend the trial they may seek to understand the verdict and how it be reach even in case where victim attend the trial myriad factor may exacerbate the difficulty they experience in follow court proceeding include have to face the defendant and the defendant family which can be particularly difficult for victim whose first language be not english the ability to access transcript from court proceeding be an essential part of maintain transparency and accountability within the system that be why we have provide the require technology to the crown court to enable transcription of different part of the hearing from the recording make in all proceeding understandably cost be attach to transcribe what could be week worth of audio which will vary depend on the length of the trial transcription company calculate the cost on case by case basis depend on variety of factor such as the size of the transcript whether it be copy or new version be request and how quickly the transcript be require prepare court transcript be currently manual process whereby transcription company listen to audio file to transcribe the hearing although ai technology be available the most recent pilot to test voice to text technology do not demonstrate sufficient accuracy an element that be crucial where criminal trial record be concerned take together produce full trial transcript depend on its size can cost in the region of thousand of pound as the hon lady point out appreciate the concern around the charge quote for trial transcript however the call to provide transcript free of charge to victim in all case involve significant financial implication to the taxpayer which require careful analysis it be also important to recognise that subsidise the cost of full trial transcript use public fund risk divert those resource away from other avenue to improve victim service and outcome the ministry of justice have be work to make court record such as transcript judgment and judicial sentencing remark increasingly accessible include through more of they be publish online reassure the hon lady that we be carefully consider the issue that she raise as part of that work we be committed to ensure that victim be support at every juncture of the criminal justice system that be why we introduce the victims and prisoners bill which continue its passage through parliament the bill will enshrine in primary legislation the overarching principle that must be reflect in the victim code include entitlement for victim to be provide with information about the criminal justice process as well as access to support service that package build on concrete measure that be already make real difference include our commitment to the end to end rape review which have already see we return adult rape case reach court to level well ahead of schedule gently point out that it be not true that the government have abandon victim the government have introduce measure that allow complainant to pre record their evidence save they from have to face their attacker we stand up rape support line victim have the right to court familiarisation visit to seek redetermination in the event that the crown prosecution service decide to reduce the charge and to make victim personal statement we will quadruple victim funding by up from million in and we have roll out more than independent sexual violence adviser we have roll out enhance support at three crown court in newcastle leeds and snaresbrook through the specialist sexual violence support project we have upgrade technology and facility and will continue with trauma inform training for staff case co ordinator to improve case progress and give victim more opportunity to observe sentencing hearing remotely there be obviously more to be do but gently put it on the record that the idea that victim of sexual crime be be abandon be simply not true do not think that ever accuse the government of have abandon victim so it be slightly odd that the minister be rebut that however will he expand slightly on whether victim could be provide directly with oral recording instead of have to pay for expensive transcript that have be create from they my understanding be that at present it be possible for victim to visit the court by arrangement to listen to full audio transcript of the trial and that the sentencing remark can be particularly helpful to victim in understand how the judgment be arrive at access to those be piece of work that we be work on at pace accept the point about audio and be more than happy to take away whether they can be provide as step far than the victim have to attend court that be fair challenge which will happily take away the hon lady comment on the various report by the justice committee she will also know that the department recently conduct call for evidence on the matter of open justice and ask the public which court record should be publish online and make available on request that exercise be fundamental to ensure that we continue to uphold the principle of openness and transparency while look at way to modernise the court to meet people expectation the call for evidence close in september and we be currently evaluate the information provide we will report back on our response early next year alongside the victims and prisoners bill and the call for evidence assure the hon lady that the ministry of justice be work with his majesty courts and tribunals service to identify further opportunity to improve victim experience of the criminal justice system that include examine among other matter the cost that they incur when obtain court transcript recognise that she have table an amendment to the bill she will be able to expand on her argument and take the matter up directly with the relevant bill minister when we come to that specific part of the bill reiterate that victim can apply to the court for permission to listen to the audio recording to hear it at suitable location free of charge it be at judicial discretion but that be an opportunity for victim to hear the trial to help with court transcription cost we have make sure that bereaved family member of victim of homicide and of death by dangerous driving can get copy of the judicial sentencing remark specific part of the sentencing hearing pay for by the public purse in certain serious criminal case copy of the sentencing remark can be make available but do accept that the hon lady would like we to go far as have say the call for evidence on openness be be evaluate and will ensure that her view be take into account as part of that work to conclude in line with the key principle of open and transparent justice recognise how important it be for victim to be able to access the transcript of criminal proceeding there be exist policy that operate to achieve transparency for victim within the criminal justice system but recognise that there remain concern about the transcription charge can assure you madam deputy speaker and the hon lady that the government be commit to improve the experience and support that victim receive the ministry of justice will continue to progress the victims and prisoners bill to put victim interest firmly at the heart of the justice system we will also analyse and use the response that we have receive in the recent call for evidence on the matter of open justice and court record to well inform future policy finally we will continue to identify opportunity to improve victim experience of the criminal justice system which include examine the charge that they incur when obtain court transcript question put and agree to house adjourn
